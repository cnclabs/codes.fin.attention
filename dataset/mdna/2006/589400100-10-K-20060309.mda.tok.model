at year end  approximately of the company s total investment portfolio  at market values  and of its total fixed maturity investments  at market values  were invested in investment grade tax exempt revenue and municipal bonds 
shorter duration sinking fund preferred stocks and collateralized mortgage obligations represented a combined of the company s total investment portfolio  at market values  at december  the average standard poor s rating of the company s bond holdings was aa at december  holdings of lower than investment grade bonds constitute approximately of total invested assets 
the nominal average maturity of the overall bond portfolio  including collateralized mortgage obligations and short term cash investments  was years at december   which reflects a heavy portfolio mix in investment grade tax exempt revenue and municipal bonds 
the call adjusted average maturity of the overall bond portfolio was shorter  approximately years  because holdings are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified duration of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was years at december   including collateralized mortgage obligations with modified durations of approximately years and short term cash investments that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms  which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
the longer the duration  the greater the price volatility in relation to changes in interest rates 
equity holdings consist of perpetual preferred stocks and dividend bearing common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax sheltered by the corporate dividend exclusion 
at year end  short term cash investments consisted of highly rated short duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis 
this component of the portfolio is increased by management when longer term investment opportunities are considered unattractive as a result of the current interest rate environment

includes investment write downs  net of tax benefit that the company considered to be other than temporary of million in  million in  million in and million in there were no investment write downs in competitive conditions the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
the insurance industry consists of a large number of companies  many of which operate in more than one state  offering automobile  homeowners and commercial property insurance  as well as insurance coverage in other lines 
many of the company s competitors have larger volumes of business and greater financial resources than the company 
based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written  the company in was the third largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in california 
the company s competitors having greater shares of the california market sell insurance through exclusive agents  rather than through independent agents and brokers 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity soft market 
in management s view  and were periods of very good results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
the company expects to be profitable for the industry and consequently the market should continue to be very competitive 
however  the company also believes that industry results may begin to deteriorate primarily as a result of loss inflation without offsetting rate increases 
this could lead to a hardening of the market over the next months 
price and reputation for service are the principal means by which the company competes with other automobile insurers 
the company believes that it has a good reputation for service  and it has  historically  been among the lowest priced insurers doing business in california according to surveys conducted by the california doi 
in addition to good service and competitive pricing  for those insurers dealing through independent agents or brokers  as the company does  the marketing efforts of agents and brokers can also provide a competitive advantage 
all rates charged by private passenger automobile insurers are subject to the prior approval of the california doi 
see regulation automobile insurance rating factor regulations 
the company encounters similar competition in each state and each line of business in which it operates outside california 
reinsurance effective january   the company terminated a property per risk reinsurance treaty that had been in place with swiss re since january  and replaced it with a similar treaty with employers reinsurance corporation erc 
the new treaty  which covers commercial property and homeowners lines  provides first layer coverage of  in excess of  for each risk  second layer coverage of  in excess of  per risk and third layer coverage of  in excess of  per risk 
the swiss re treaty was terminated on a cut off basis meaning that swiss re will remain liable for losses occurring prior to the date of termination 
the swiss re treaty provides first layer coverage of  in excess of  second layer coverage of  in excess of  third layer coverage of  in excess of  and fourth layer coverage of  in excess of  prior to october   the company had in place a treaty reinsurance agreement with swiss re  where risks written under personal umbrella policies were ceded to swiss re on a quota share basis 
prior to may  the treaty was on a quota share basis and provided million coverage in excess of million for each risk 
effective may   the treaty was replaced with a quota share agreement for umbrella policies with coverage amounts up to but not exceeding million 
effective october   the umbrella coverage was terminated 
the company has chosen to end the treaty on a run off basis meaning that the treaty will remain active for one year after the termination date with policies incepting september  and prior being covered per the treaty terms 
policies incepting on october  and after do not have any reinsurance coverage 
effective april   the company purchased catastrophe reinsurance that provides coverage on florida and georgia property equal to of million in excess of the first million of losses per occurrence 
the reinsurance was placed with domestic and non domestic reinsurers and several lloyds syndicates 
this treaty affords coverage in addition to that provided by the florida hurricane catastrophe trust fund fhcf 
the company estimates that the fhcf provides coverage equal to of approximately million in excess of approximately million 
for california  the company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes due to the placement of earthquake risks  written in conjunction with california homeowners policies  with the california earthquake authority 
see regulation california earthquake authority 
although the company s catastrophe exposure to earthquakes has been reduced  the company continues to have catastrophe exposure for fire following an earthquake 
erc reinsures ami through working layer treaties for property and casualty losses in excess of  up to million 
ami has other reinsurance treaties and facultative arrangements in place for various smaller lines of business 
mcm maintains reinsurance treaties with several reinsurers covering policies prior to january  the company also holds a formal guarantee from erc which reimburses mcm if any of the reinsurers fails to satisfy its obligations under its respective reinsurance agreement 
if any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under the reinsurance treaty  the company will be required  as primary insurer  to discharge all obligations to its insureds in their entirety 
regulation the company s business in the states in which it operates is subject to significant regulation and supervision by the doi of each state  each of which has broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers 
california department of insurance oversight the powers of the california doi primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors  the establishment of capital and surplus requirements and standards of solvency  restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates 
the regulations of and supervision by the california doi are designed principally for the benefit of policyholders and not for insurance company shareholders 
persistency discounts are discounts provided to consumers based on the number of consecutive years the consumer has had insurance coverage 
in  following the enactment of proposition and its prior approval requirement for insurance premiums in california  the california doi issued regulations permitting persistency as a rating factor 
the regulations provided no definition of persistency 
following a market conduct examination of the company  the california doi determined that the company s persistency discount  awarded only to consumers previously insured by the company or its agents and brokers so called loyalty persistency  was unfairly discriminatory 
in response  in the company obtained approval for a persistency discount awarded to insureds with continuous coverage with any insurer what has come to be called portable persistency 
this discount was consistently reapproved until when the california doi  under then commissioner harry low  took the position that only loyalty persistency that is  the kind of persistency discount the company awarded prior to was allowable under proposition in  the california doi required all insurers offering persistency discounts to eliminate their portability 
however  senate bill sb  enacted in  amended the california insurance code to allow portable persistency discounts 
sb was challenged in the courts and on september  was overturned in a decision by the california court of appeal in the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights  et al 
v 
garamendi 
the company s petition for review of this decision was denied by the california supreme court in january consequently  the company has filed and received approval for a revenue neutral rate change eliminating persistency which effectively increases the rates charged to some insureds moderately and lowers rates for all others 
since the new rates went in effect  the company has seen an increase in the number of new applications 
however  it is not yet possible to determine if this will have a material impact on the company or its operations 
in february  the california doi issued a notice of non compliance nnc based on the trial court ruling in the robert krumme litigation 
the nnc alleges that the company willfully misrepresented the actual price insurance consumers could expect to pay for insurance by the amount of a one time fee charged by the consumer s insurance broker 
the company filed a notice of defense which is based on the same grounds that formed the company s defense in the robert krumme case as well as what the san francisco superior court appeared to regard as the doi s acquiescence to our practices 
the company does not believe that it has done anything to warrant a monetary penalty from the california doi 
if a monetary penalty is imposed  the company is unable to estimate the ultimate amount of any monetary penalty  and therefore no reserve for the potential monetary penalty has been established in the consolidated financial statements 
the california doi is also responsible for conducting periodic financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in california 
during  the california doi completed a financial examination of the california companies as of december  these examinations resulted in no material recommendations 
the california doi s market conduct division is responsible for conducting periodic examinations of companies to ensure compliance with the california insurance code and the california code of regulations with respect to rating  underwriting and claims handling practices 
in november  the doi issued a nnc related to several issues raised from a market conduct examination dating back to the company has filed a statement of compliance and a request for public hearing that states and evidences support that the alleged non compliance does not exist 
in december  the doi issued a nnc challenging the company s marital status rating factor 
the company has filed a statement of compliance asserting that its rating factor is applied according to industry standard and has been approved as such by the doi 
during  the doi completed an examination which covered a compliance review of the activities of the company s special investigation unit 
the examination resulted in no material recommendations 
state insurance agency oversight in other states the insurance companies outside california are subject to the regulatory powers of the dois of the various states in which they operate 
those powers are similar to the regulatory powers in california enumerated above 
generally  the regulations relate to standards of solvency and are designed for the benefit of policyholders and not of insurance company shareholders 
like california  insurance rates in georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada require prior approval from the state doi  while insurance rates in illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan must only be filed with the respective doi before they are implemented 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the doi of each state is also responsible for conducting periodic financial examinations of the insurance companies domiciled in its state 
in  the florida doi completed financial examinations of micfl and midam as of december  the texas doi completed financial examinations of mcm and ami lloyds as of december  the oklahoma doi completed a financial examination of ami as of december  these examinations resulted in no material recommendations 
at december   the georgia doi is conducting a financial examination of the company s georgia insurance subsidiaries for the period ending december   and the doi in the states of florida and illinois are conducting financial examinations for the company s insurance subsidiaries domiciled in these states for the period ending december  reports for these examinations are not yet available 
in addition to the financial examinations  the doi in each state conducts market conduct examinations to ensure compliance with the insurance statutes and regulations of each state in which the company operates with respect to rating  underwriting and claims handling practices 
at december   the doi for the states of texas  florida and arizona are conducting market conduct examinations of the company s automobile lines of business and the florida doi is also conducting a market conduct examination of the company s homeowners line of business 
in february  the company responded to a proposed consent order the order received from the florida doi 
the order details preliminary findings from the market conduct examination 
as of december   the company has accrued for those items that it believes will have a financial impact 
in addition  the order proposes a fine for an unspecified amount of money 
the company has established an accrual for a potential fine  however  it is possible that the actual fine could be greater or less than the amount accrued 
the company believes that the fine  if any  should not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
during  the new jersey doi conducted a market conduct examination of midam as of january  the new jersey doi issued an adopted report on february   and the company is currently in the process of responding to the new jersey doi 
the operations of the company are dependent on the laws of the states in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the company 
the company retains its own legislative advocates in california 
the company also makes financial contributions to officeholders and candidates 
in and  those contributions amounted to  and  respectively 
the company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate 
insurance guarantee association the california insurance guarantee association the association was created to provide for payment of claims for which insolvent insurers of most casualty lines are liable but which cannot be paid out of such insurers assets 
the company is subject to assessment by the association for its pro rata share of such claims based on premiums written in the particular line in the year preceding the assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in california 
such assessments are based upon estimates of losses to be incurred in liquidating an insolvent insurer 
in a particular year  the company cannot be assessed an amount greater than of its premiums written in the preceding year 
assessments are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment 
insurance subsidiaries in the other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations 
the company accounts for assessments in accordance with aicpa statement of position accounting by insurance and other enterprises for insurance related assessments sop  which requires the recognition of a liability when an assessment is levied or information is available indicating that an assessment is probable 
in addition  sop prohibits the recognition of an asset for recoveries related to new business or renewal of short duration policies 
during  the company paid approximately million in assessments to the new jersey unsatisfied claim and judgment fund and the new jersey property liability insurance guaranty association for assessments relating to its personal automobile line of business 
in addition  the company paid approximately million to the florida citizens property insurance corporation for assessments relating to its homeowners line of business 
as permitted by state law  all of the florida assessment and approximately million of the new jersey assessment is recoupable through a surcharge to policyholders 
during  the company began to recoup these assessments and will continue recouping them in it is possible that there will be additional assessments in holding company act the california companies are subject to regulation by the california doi pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
the california doi may examine the affairs of each of the california companies at any time 
the holding company act requires disclosure of any material transactions among the companies 
certain transactions and dividends defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be effected if the california doi disapproves the transaction within days after notice 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  certain reinsurance transactions and sales  purchases  exchanges  loans and extensions of credit  and investments  in the net aggregate  involving more than the lesser of of the respective california company s admitted assets or of statutory surplus as regards policyholders  as of the preceding december an extraordinary dividend is a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year 
an insurance company is also required to notify the california doi of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the california doi 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or of a person that controls a california insurance company  such as mercury general 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the california doi an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
each of the insurance companies is subject to holding company regulations in the states in which it is domiciled  the provisions of which are substantially similar to those of the holding company act 
assigned risks automobile liability insurers in california are required to sell bodily injury liability  property damage liability  medical expense and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number based on the insurer s share of the california automobile casualty insurance market of those drivers applying for placement as assigned risks 
drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics  as defined by proposition  make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market 
in  assigned risks represented of total automobile direct premiums written and of total automobile direct premium earned 
the company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market 
many of the other states in which the company conducts business offer similar programs to that of california 
these programs are not a significant contributor to the business written in those states 
automobile insurance rating factor regulations california proposition requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the california doi prior to their use  and that no rate be approved which is excessive  inadequate  unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative 
the proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in decreasing order of importance in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance the insured s driving safety record  the number of miles the insured drives annually  the number of years of driving experience of the insured and whatever optional factors are determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a discount to good drivers  as defined  from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a good driver 
the company s rate plan was approved by the california doi and operates under these rating factor regulations 
in december  the california insurance commissioner introduced new regulations designed to reduce the impact of automobile insurance rates based on where people live 
current regulations allow companies to average the weight of all the optional factors  and the average weight of the optional rating factors must be less than the third statutory factor 
the proposed regulation requires each individual optional factor such as territory to have less weight than the third statutory factor 
the commissioner expects these regulations to be effective in late after public hearings and review by the california office of administrative law oal 
following the announcement of the effective date of this proposed regulation  every insurer will have days to submit a class plan which complies with these regulations 
the insurance industry has argued that territory is a useful predictor of risk because it takes into account aspects such as the number of accidents and theft in a particular area 
many insurers  including the company  place a higher weight on this optional factor 
certain studies have predicted that reducing the weight of territory in developing automobile insurance rates would likely hurt consumers in the rural and suburban areas where automobile insurance rates would  on average  increase and help consumers in the urban areas where automobile insurance rates would  on average  decrease 
depending upon the results of the public hearing and the oal review  the insurance industry may challenge the commissioner s proposal in court on the basis that the results of this regulation are unfairly discriminatory 
the outcome of these proposed regulations is not certain at the present time and the company is unable to determine the impact that these proposed regulations  if enacted  would have on its business 
california financial responsibility law california requires proof of insurance for the registration new or renewal of a motor vehicle 
it also provides for substantial penalties for failure to supply proof of insurance if a driver is stopped for a traffic violation 
in addition  california provides that uninsured drivers who are injured in an automobile accident are able to recover only actual  out of pocket medical expenses and lost wages and are not entitled to receive awards for general damages  ie  pain and suffering 
this restriction also applies to drunk drivers and fleeing felons 
the law has helped in controlling loss costs 
california earthquake authority the california earthquake authority cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
since  the company places all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowners policy through the cea 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most recent information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at april   is approximately million 
terrorism risk insurance act of the federal government enacted the terrorism risk insurance act of the act to establish a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from acts of terrorism  as defined within the act 
scheduled to expire on december   the act was extended for two additional years and amended by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of the extension act 
the terrorism insurance program the program requires commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the united states to participate 
the extension act modified the provisions of the act by providing exclusions of certain insured coverages such as commercial automobile insurance  creating a program trigger for funding of certified events occurring after march  which exceed aggregate industry losses of million in and million in the us government funding for certified events will remain at of covered losses in  decreasing to of covered losses in each insurance company is subject to a deductible based upon a percentage of the previous year s direct earned premium  with the percentage increasing each year 
the program  as amended  runs through december  the company writes a limited amount of commercial property policies and does not write policies on properties considered to be a target of terrorist activities such as airports  hotels  large office structures  amusement parks  landmark defined structures or other public facilities 
in addition  the company does not insure a high concentration of commercial policies in any one area where increased exposure to terrorist threats exist 
consequently  the company believes its exposure relating to acts of terrorism is low

risk factors the company s business involves various risks and uncertainties  some of which are discussed in this section 
the information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and the other documents and materials filed by the company with the sec  as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company  or that it currently believes to be immaterial  may also adversely affect the company s business 
any of the following risks or uncertainties that develop into actual events could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the company and its business the company is a holding company that relies on regulated subsidiaries for cash to satisfy its obligations 
as a holding company  the company maintains no operations that generate revenue to pay operating expenses  shareholders dividends or to pay principal or interest on its indebtedness 
consequently  the company relies on the ability of its insurance subsidiaries  and particularly its california insurance subsidiaries  to pay dividends so that the company can meet its debt payment obligations and pay other expenses 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is regulated by state insurance laws  which limit the amount  and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of  cash dividends 
generally  these insurance regulations permit the payment of dividends only out of earned surplus in any year which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  do not exceed the greater of of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year  with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval 
the inability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable the company to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
if the company s loss reserves are inadequate  its business and financial position could be harmed 
the process of establishing property and liability loss reserves is inherently uncertain due to a number of factors  including underwriting quality  the frequency and amount of covered losses  variations in claims settlement practices  the costs and uncertainty of litigation  and expanding theories of liability 
while the company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating loss reserves  the company s methods may prove to be inadequate 
if any of these contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  results in loss reserves that are not sufficient to cover its actual losses  its results of operations  liquidity and financial position may be materially adversely affected 
the company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders 
the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations depend on the company s ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it faces 
premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
in order to price its products accurately  the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
the company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result  price accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation availability of sufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions  generally  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  the company s ability to innovate with new pricing strategies  and the success of those innovations  the company s ability to predict retention eg  policy life expectancy accurately  unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  ongoing changes in the company s claim settlement practices  changing driving patterns  unexpected inflation in the medical sector of the economy  and unanticipated inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
such risks may result in the company s pricing being based on outdated  inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses  assumptions or methodologies  and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  the company could underprice risks  which would negatively affect the company s margins  or it could overprice risks  which could reduce the company s volume and competitiveness 
in either event  the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the company s business are uncertain and may have an adverse effect on the company s business 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the company s business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after the company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under the company s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 
the company s private passenger insurance rates are subject to prior approval by the departments of insurance in most of the states in which the company operates  and to political influences 
in most of the states in which the company operates  it must obtain prior approval from the state department of insurance of the private passenger insurance rates charged to its customers  including any increases in those rates 
if the company is unable to receive approval of the rate increases it requests  the company s ability to operate its business in a profitable manner may be limited and its liquidity  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set rates at levels that do not correspond with underlying costs  in the opinion of the company s management 
the homeowners insurance business faces similar pressure  particularly as regulators in catastrophe prone states seek an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
in addition  various insurance underwriting and pricing criteria regularly come under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation or regulations that would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company remains highly dependent upon california and several other key states to produce revenues 
for the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in california  of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in florida and of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in new jersey 
the company s financial results are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions in these states and changes in any of these conditions could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
if the company cannot maintain its am best ratings  it may not be able to maintain premium volume in its insurance operations sufficient to attain the company s financial performance goals 
the company s ability to retain its existing business or to attract new business in its insurance operations is affected by its rating by am best company 
am best company currently rates all of the company s insurance subsidiaries with sufficient operating history to be rated as either a superior or a excellent 
if the company is unable to maintain its am best ratings  the company may not be able to grow its premium volume sufficiently to attain its financial performance goals  and if am best were to downgrade the company s rating  the company could lose significant premium volume 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements  and any failure to meet these requirements could subject the company s insurance subsidiaries to regulatory action 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable laws of their state of domicile 
the risk based capital standards  based upon the risk based capital model act adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  require the company s insurance company subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the naic 
if any of the company s insurance subsidiaries fails to meet these standards and requirements  the department of insurance regulating such subsidiary may require specified actions by the subsidiary 
there is uncertainty involved in the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables 
the company reinsures a portion of its potential losses on the policies it issues to mitigate the volatility of the losses on its financial condition and results of operations 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions  which are outside of the company s control 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases prevented  insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
as a result  the company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer a portion of the company s risk through reinsurance arrangements 
in addition  as is customary  the company initially pays all claims and seeks to recover the reinsured losses from its reinsurers 
although the company reports as assets the amount of claims paid which the company expects to recover from reinsurers  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to collect from its reinsurers 
if the amounts actually recoverable under the company s reinsurance treaties are ultimately determined to be less than the amount it has reported as recoverable  the company may incur a loss during the period in which that determination is made 
the company depends on independent agents who may discontinue sales of its policies at any time 
the company sells its insurance policies through more than  independent brokers and agents 
the company must compete with other insurance carriers for these brokers and agents business 
some competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage  higher commissions  or more attractive non cash incentives 
to maintain its relationship with these independent agents  the company must pay competitive commissions  be able to respond to their needs quickly and adequately  and create a consistently high level of customer satisfaction 
if these independent agents find it preferable to do business with the company s competitors  it would be difficult to renew the company s existing business or attract new business 
recent or future regulations may also limit the manner in which the company s producers are compensated or incentivized 
such developments could negatively impact the company s relationship with these parties and ultimately reduce revenues 
one independent broker of the company is responsible for a significant amount of the company s revenues  and the loss of business provided by that broker could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company markets its insurance policies primarily through independent agents and brokers 
one broker provided of the company s direct written premiums in the year ended december  loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by this broker could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
changes in market interest rates or defaults may have an adverse effect on the company s investment portfolio  which may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s results are affected  in part  by the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments  such as municipal and corporate bonds 
increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities 
declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on the company s investment income as it invests positive cash flows from operations and as it reinvests proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than the company s investments have historically generated 
defaults in the company s investment portfolio may produce operating losses and reduce the company s capital and surplus 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
although the company takes measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  it may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
the company s mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
despite its mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s book value 
the company s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
the company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events  particularly hurricanes  earthquakes  hail storms  explosions  tropical storms  fires  war  acts of terrorism  severe winter weather and other natural and man made disasters 
because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable  historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations  and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in the company s financial condition or results of operations from period to period 
although the company attempts to manage its exposure to such events  the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid 
the company s expansion plans may adversely affect its future profitability 
the company is currently expanding and intends to further expand its operations in several of the states in which the company has operations and into states in which it has not yet begun operations 
the intended expansion will necessitate increased expenditures 
the company expects to fund these expenditures out of cash flow from operations 
the expansion may not occur  or if it does occur may not be successful in providing increased revenues or profitability 
if the company s cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover the increased costs of the expansion or if the expansion does not provide the benefits anticipated  the company s financial condition and results of operations and ability to grow its business may be harmed 
the company may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
the company s future capital requirements depends on many factors  including its ability to write new business successfully  its ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses and the success of its current expansion plans 
the company may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce its assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to the company s shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
if the company cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  its business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business  and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation  could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on the accuracy  reliability and proper functioning of its information technology systems 
the company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business  including underwriting  policy acquisition  claims processing and handling  accounting  reserving and actuarial processes and policies  and to maintain its policyholder data 
the company is developing and deploying a new next generation information technology system that is intended to manage many of these functions across all of the states in which it operates and all of the lines of insurance it offers 
the failure of hardware or software that supports the company s information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems or any delay or failure in the full deployment of the company s next generation information technology system could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums  increased overhead costs and inaccurate reporting  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the company s information technology systems  these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power loss  unauthorized access  and computer systems  or internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
it is possible that a system failure  accident or security breach could result in a material disruption to the company s business 
in addition  substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 
following implementation of its next generation system  the company may from time to time install new or upgraded business management systems 
to the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner  the company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  the company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes the company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s results and financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
the company s management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec require the company to include in its form k a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
areas of the company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if the company s auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on its stock price 
the ability of the company to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to the company s success 
as the company expands its operations  it must hire and train new employees  and retain current employees to handle the resulting increase in new inquiries  policies  customers and claims 
the failure of the company to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could result in the company having to slow the growth of its business in some jurisdictions 
in addition  the failure to adequately staff its claims department could result in decreased quality of the company s claims operations 
the company s success also depends heavily upon the continued contributions of its executive officers  both individually and as a group 
the company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to retain and motivate its management team 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers  and particularly george joseph  could prevent the company from successfully implementing its business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces litigation risks which  if decided adversely to the company  could impact its financial results 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits 
these lawsuits are described more fully in item legal proceedings 
litigation  by its very nature  is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain 
the precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuits is uncertain and may  if these lawsuits are determined adversely to the company  negatively impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and its results of operations  which could materially increase the company s costs and expenses 
in addition  potential litigation involving new claim  coverage and business practice issues could adversely affect the company s business by changing the way policies are priced  extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or increasing the size of claims 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim  coverage and business practice issues could negatively impact the company s revenues or its methods of doing business 
risks related to the company s industry the private passenger insurance business is highly competitive  and the company may not be able to compete effectively against larger  better capitalized companies 
the company competes with many property and casualty insurance companies selling private passenger automobile insurance in the states in which the company operates  many of which are better capitalized than the company and have higher am best ratings 
the superior capitalization of many of the company s competitors may enable them to offer lower rates  to withstand larger losses  and to take advantage more effectively of new marketing opportunities 
the company s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate 
the company s ability to compete against these larger  better capitalized competitors depends importantly on its ability to deliver superior service and its strong relationships with independent agents 
the company may from time to time undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth 
if the company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the company s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers  the company s competitive position may be harmed  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in a highly competitive industry such as the automobile insurance industry  some of the company s competitors may fail from time to time 
in the event of a failure of a major insurance company  the company could be adversely affected  as the company and other insurance companies would likely be required by state law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer  and as the company would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer s former policyholders 
the company may be adversely affected by changes in the personal automobile insurance business 
approximately of the company s direct written premiums for the year ended december  were generated from personal automobile insurance policies 
adverse developments in the market for personal automobile insurance  or the personal automobile insurance industry in general  whether related to changes in competition  pricing or regulations  could cause the company s results of operations to suffer 
this industry is also exposed to the risks of severe weather conditions  such as rainstorms  snowstorms  hail and ice storms  hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes and  to a lesser degree  explosions  terrorist attacks and riots 
the automobile insurance business is also affected by cost trends that impact profitability 
factors which negatively affect cost trends include inflation in automobile repair costs  automobile parts costs  used car prices and medical care 
increased litigation of claims  particularly those involving allegations of bad faith or seeking extra contractual and punitive damages  may also adversely affect loss costs 
the insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation  which may affect the company s ability to execute its business plan and grow its business 
the company is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of the states in which its insurance subsidiaries is domiciled  as well as in the states where its insurance subsidiaries sell insurance products  issue policies and handle claims 
some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to operate  innovate  obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow its business profitably 
these regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders 
the company s ability to comply with these laws and regulations  and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner  is and will continue to be critical to its success 
some of these regulations include required licensing 
the company operates under licenses issued by the departments of insurance in the states in which the company sells insurance 
if a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license  the company s ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
transactions between the company s insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates including the company generally must be disclosed to state regulators  and prior approval of the applicable regulator generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated 
state regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of some transactions  which may adversely effect the company s ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which the company conducts business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval 
if  as permitted in some states  the company begins using new rates before they are approved  it may be required to issue refunds or credits to the company s policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator 
accordingly  the company s ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected 
restrictions on cancellation  non renewal or withdrawal 
most of the states in which the company operates have laws and regulations that limit its ability to exit a market 
for example  these states may limit a private passenger auto insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies or they may prohibit the company from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state unless prior approval is received from the state insurance department 
in some states  these regulations extend to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written  not just to a complete withdrawal 
laws and regulations that limit the company s ability to cancel and non renew policies in some states or locations and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict the company s ability to exit unprofitable markets  which may harm its business and results of operations 
other regulations 
the company must also comply with regulations involving  among other things the use of non public consumer information and related privacy issues  the use of credit history in underwriting and rating  limitations on the ability to charge policy fees  limitations on types and amounts of investments  the payment of dividends  the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  involuntary assignments of high risk policies  participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations  assessments and other governmental charges  reporting with respect to financial condition  periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners  and the other regulations discussed in this annual report on form k 
compliance with laws and regulations addressing these and other issues often will result in increased administrative costs 
in addition  these laws and regulations may limit the company s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately  prevent it from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and may restrict its ability to discontinue unprofitable relationships or exit unprofitable markets 
these results  in turn  may adversely affect the company s profitability or its ability or desire to grow its business in certain jurisdictions  which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the company s common stock 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in actions by regulators  fines and penalties  and in extreme cases  revocation of the company s ability to do business in that jurisdiction 
in addition  the company may face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 
regulation may become more extensive in the future  which may adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that states will not make existing insurance related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws 
new or more restrictive regulation in any state in which the company conducts business could make it more expensive for it to continue to conduct business in these states  restrict the premiums the company is able to charge or otherwise change the way the company does business 
in such events  the company may seek to reduce its writings in  or to withdraw entirely from  these states 
in addition  from time to time  the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 
the company cannot predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted  the timing of any such adoption and what effects  if any  they may have on the company s operations  profitability and financial condition 
risks related to the company s stock the company is controlled by a few large shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including change of control transactions 
george joseph and gloria joseph collectively own more than of the company s common stock 
accordingly  george joseph and gloria joseph have the ability to exert significant influence on the actions the company may take in the future  including change of control transactions 
this concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the company s shareholders and the holders of its debt securities 
future sales of common stock may affect the market price of the company s common stock and the future exercise of options and warrants will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company may raise capital in the future through the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  such future sales will have on the market price of its common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the company s outstanding common stock  and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell common stock at a time and price that the shareholder deems appropriate 
in addition  the company has issued options to purchase shares of its common stock 
in the event that any options to purchase common stock are exercised  shareholders will suffer dilution in their investment 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of the company or the sale of any of its insurance subsidiaries 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company or any holding company of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the doi of the state where the insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of the insurer or holding company  the state doi will consider a number of factors relating to the acquiror and the transaction 
these laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company or the sale by the company of any of its insurance subsidiaries  including transactions that some or all of the company s shareholders might consider to be desirable 
although the company has consistently paid cash dividends in the past  it may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
the company has paid cash dividends on a consistent basis since the public offering of its common stock in november however  future cash dividends will depend upon a variety of factors  including the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to make distributions to the company  which may be restricted by financial  regulatory or tax constraints 
also  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution

item legal proceedings the company is  from time to time  named as a defendant in various lawsuits incidental to its insurance business 
in most of these actions  plaintiffs assert claims for punitive damages  which are not insurable under judicial decisions 
the company has established reserves for lawsuits in cases where the company is able to estimate its potential exposure and it is probable that the court will rule against the company 
the company vigorously defends actions against it  unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate 
an unfavorable ruling against the company in the actions currently pending may have a material impact on the company s quarterly results of operations  however it is not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
as previously reported  following trial and appeal in robert krumme  on behalf of the general public v 
mercury insurance company  mercury casualty company  and california automobile insurance company superior court for the city and county of san francisco  the court issued a modified injunction on july  requiring the company to compensate brokers at the same rate based on volume of sales  accept applications for insurance from any california licensed broker  remove subjective underwriting requirements from its broker instruction manual and provide guidelines to be used by its field personnel that specifically identify the standards of broker performance 
the company has implemented changes to its broker relationship to comply with the court s modified injunction 
the court also stated that some period of review must take place following any changes before a complete assessment of the brokers relationship with the company can be made  and that any further judicial review should be undertaken only after further discussions between the parties to the lawsuit and appropriate evidence reflecting the nature of such broker relationship is fully assessed 
these changes must occur during a one year period of review through november  before the court will reconsider vacating the modified injunction 
the company believes that it is in compliance with the modified injunction 
the company is not able to estimate the extent to which complying with the modified injunction will impact future trends in earnings or loss ratios 
sam donabedian  individually and on behalf of those similarly situated v 
mercury insurance company  filed his original action on april  in the los angeles superior court  asserting  among other things  a claim that the company s calculation of persistency discounts to determine premiums is an unfair business practice  a violation of the california consumer legal remedies act clra and a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the company originally prevailed on a demurrer to the complaint and the case was dismissed  however  the california court of appeal reversed the trial court s ruling  deciding that the california insurance commissioner does not have the exclusive right to review the calculation of insurance rates premiums

these subsidiaries are subject to state laws that restrict their ability to distribute dividends 
for example  california state laws permit a casualty insurance company to pay dividends and advances within any month period  without any prior regulatory approval  in an amount up to the greater of of statutory earned surplus at the preceding december  or statutory net income for the calendar year preceding the date the dividend is paid

economic and industry wide factors regulatory the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates 
state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including  in some states  approving rate changes and rating factors and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in many states  insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners 
the company has a successful track record of working with difficult regulations and new insurance commissioners 
however  there is no certainty that current or future regulations  and the interpretation of those regulations by insurance commissioners and the courts will not have an adverse impact on the company 
cost uncertainty because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected  the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned 
consequently  significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves 
while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves  there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the company s actuarial analysis shows that they are needed 
inflation the largest cost component for automobile insurers are losses which include medical costs and replacement automobile parts and labor repair costs 
there has recently been significant variation in the overall increases in medical cost inflation and it is often a year or more after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty 
therefore  it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates  particularly when actual inflation rates are higher or lower than anticipated 
the company currently estimates low single digit inflation rates on bodily injury coverages for its major california personal automobile lines for the accident year 
the inflation rate for this accident year is the most difficult to estimate because there remain many open claims 
should actual inflation be higher the company could be under reserved for its losses and profit margins would be lower 
loss frequency another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency  which is the number of claims per risks insured 
there has been a long term trend of declining loss frequency in the personal automobile insurance industry  which has benefited the industry as a whole 
however  it is unknown if loss frequency in the future will continue to decline  remain flat or increase 
underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the company has historically seen premium growth in excess of during hard markets  whereas premium growth rates during soft markets have historically been in the single digits 
many of the company s major competitors announced improved operating results in and throughout this typically signals a softening in the market  and consequently  the company experienced a decline in the rate of growth of its policies in force in california during revenues  income and cash generation the company generates its revenues through the sale of insurance policies  primarily covering personal automobiles and homeowners 
these policies are sold through independent agents and brokers who receive a commission on average of of net premiums written for selling and servicing the policies 
the company believes that it has a more thorough underwriting process which gives the company an advantage over its competitors 
the company views its agent relationships and underwriting process as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower prices yet realize better margins 
the company also generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which was approximately billion at the end of this investment portfolio generated nearly million in pre tax investment income during the portfolio is managed by company personnel with a view towards maximizing after tax yields and limiting interest rate and credit risk 
the company s results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  which was approximately million in the company s cash flow from operations has exceeded million every year since and has been positive for over years 
cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and to help support growth 
opportunities  challenges and risks the company currently underwrites personal automobile insurance in thirteen states arizona  california  florida  georgia  illinois  michigan  nevada  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  pennsylvania  texas and virginia 
the company expects to continue its growth by expanding into new states in future years with the objective of achieving greater geographic diversification  so that non california premiums eventually account for as much as half of the company s total premiums 
there are  however  challenges and risks involved in entering each new state  including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state  working with a new regulatory regime  hiring and training competent personnel  building adequate systems and finding qualified agents to represent the company 
the company does not expect to enter into any new states until its nextgen computer system is successfully implemented 
see technology 
the company is also subject to risks inherent in its business  which include but are not limited to the following a catastrophe  such as a major wildfire  earthquake or hurricane  can cause a significant amount of loss to the company in a very short period of time 
a major regulatory change could make it more difficult for the company to generate new business 
a sharp upward increase in market interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could cause a significant loss in the value of the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent it is within the company s control  the company seeks to manage these risks in order to mitigate the effect that major events would have on the company s financial position 
technology the company is currently developing a next generation nextgen computer system to replace its existing underwriting  billings  claims and commissions legacy systems that currently reside on hewlett packard mainframe computers 
the nextgen system is designed to be a multi state  multi line system that is expected to enable the company to enter new states more rapidly  as well as respond to legislative and regulatory changes more easily than the company s current systems 
the nextgen system is initially being deployed for the personal automobile line of business and has been successfully implemented in one state virginia 
the company expects to implement nextgen in its other states in and the company has currently spent approximately million on nextgen and expects additional costs to be incurred during the implementation period 
nextgen is expected to provide a positive benefit to the company 
as with any large scale technology implementation  risks associated with system implementation can occur that could significantly impact the operations of the company and increase the expected costs of the project  although management has expended planning and development efforts to mitigate these risks 
general the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
these cycles can have a large impact on the ability of the company to grow and retain business 
in management s view  and were periods of very good results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
as a result  the automobile insurance market is extremely competitive 
the company expects this trend to continue in the company operates primarily in the state of california  which was the only state in which it produced business prior to the company has since expanded its operations into the following states georgia  illinois  oklahoma  texas  florida  virginia  new york  new jersey  arizona  pennsylvania  michigan and nevada 
during  approximately of the company s total net premiums written were derived from california as compared to in the decrease was the result of a greater portion of business written outside of california 
the company has established a diversification goal to produce half of its business outside of california by the end of there are factors  some of which are outside of the company s control  that could prevent the company from achieving this goal 
the process for implementing rate changes varies by state  with california  georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada requiring prior approval from the doi before a rate can be implemented 
illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi  while oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
during  the company had no rate increases in california and implemented automobile rate increases in only three of the twelve non california states 
the company believes that its rates will remain competitive in the marketplace 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company believes that its marketing efforts  combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation make the company very competitive in california and in other states 
during  the company incurred approximately million in advertising expenses 
the california doi uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and whatever optional factors are determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the regulations further require that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
in december  the california insurance commissioner introduced new regulations designed to reduce the impact on automobile insurance rates based on where people live 
current regulations allow companies to average the weight of all the optional rating factors  and the average weight of the optional rating factors must be less than the third statutory factor 
the proposed regulation requires each individual optional factor such as territory to have less weight than the third statutory factor 
the california commissioner expects these regulations to be effective in late after public hearings and review by the california office of administrative law oal 
following the announcement of the effective date of this proposed regulation  every insurer will have days to submit a class plan which complies with these regulations 
the insurance industry has argued that territory is a useful predictor of risk because it takes into account aspects such as the number of accidents and theft in a particular area 
many insurers  including the company  place a higher weight on this optional factor 
certain studies have predicted that reducing the weight of territory in developing automobile insurance rates would likely hurt consumers in the rural and suburban areas where automobile insurance rates would  on average  increase and help consumers in the urban areas where automobile insurance rates would  on average  decrease 
depending upon the results of the public hearing and the oal review  the insurance industry may challenge the california commissioner s proposal in court on the basis that the results of this regulation are unfairly discriminatory 
the outcome of these proposed regulations is not certain at the present time and the company is unable to determine the impact that these proposed regulations  if enacted  would have on its business 
persistency discounts are discounts to consumers based on the number of consecutive years the consumer has had insurance coverage 
in  following the enactment of proposition and its prior approval requirement for insurance premiums in california  the california doi issued regulations permitting persistency as a rating factor 
the regulations  however  provided no definition of persistency 
following a market conduct examination of the company  the california doi determined that the company s persistency discount  awarded only to consumers previously insured by the company or its agents and brokers so called loyalty persistency  was unfairly discriminatory 
in response  in the company obtained approval for a persistency discount awarded to insureds with continuous coverage with any insurer what has come to be called portable persistency 
this discount was consistently reapproved until when the california doi  under then commissioner harry low took the position that only loyalty persistency that is  the kind of persistency discount the company awarded prior to was allowable under proposition in  the california doi required all insurers offering persistency discounts to eliminate their portability 
however  senate bill sb  enacted in  amended the california insurance code to allow portable persistency discounts 
sb was challenged in the courts and on september  was overturned in a decision by the california court of appeal in the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights  et al 
v 
garamendi 
the company s petition for review of this decision was denied by the california supreme court in january consequently  the company has filed and received approval for a revenue neutral rate change eliminating persistency which effectively increases the rates charged to some insureds moderately and lowers rates for all others 
since the new rates went in effect  the company has seen an increase in the number of new applications 
however  it is not yet possible to determine if this will have a material impact on the company or its operations 
on june   the california state board of equalization sbe upheld notices of proposed assessments issued against the company for tax years through in which the franchise tax board ftb disallowed a portion of the company s expenses related to management services provided to its insurance company subsidiaries on grounds that such expenses were allocable to the company s tax deductible dividends from such subsidiaries 
the sbe decision also resulted in a smaller disallowance of the company s interest expense deductions than was proposed by the ftb in those years 
the company filed a petition for rehearing with the sbe relating to these franchise tax issues and a rehearing was granted and held on july  at the rehearing  additional briefings were requested before the sbe would rule on the matter 
these briefings were filed with the sbe and another rehearing is scheduled for march  the potential net exposure on the franchise tax issues for through  after federal tax benefit  amounts to approximately million  which includes a potential tax amnesty interest penalty of approximately million 
the amnesty penalty relates to a revenue enhancement provision contained in the california tax amnesty legislation requiring taxpayers with tax assessments for tax years and prior  whether or not disputed  to pay amounts due by march  or risk paying an additional penalty amount equal to of the interest computed on the original assessment for the period beginning with the due date of the return and ending on march  these amounts would be due should the company not prevail on the underlying tax issues 
the company believes that the deduction of the expenses related to management services provided to its insurance company subsidiaries is appropriate 
the company has established a tax liability of approximately million for the franchise tax issues related to the tax years through an unfavorable ruling against the company in the rehearing may have a material impact on the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result of california assembly bill ab  the company paid approximately million in california franchise taxes for the tax years through during ab resolved an issue raised by the ftb where they interpreted a legal ruling to eliminate a dividends received deduction drd taken by companies on dividends received from their insurance subsidiaries 
ab provides for an drd for tax years through and an drd for tax years after the california ftb has audited the through tax returns and they accepted the through returns to be correct as filed 
for the and tax returns  the ftb has taken exception to the state apportionment factors used by the company 
specifically  the ftb has asserted that payroll and property factors from mercury insurance services  llc  a subsidiary of mercury casualty company that is excluded from the mercury general california franchise tax return  should be included in the california apportionment factors 
based on this assertion  the ftb issued notices of proposed tax assessments in january for the and tax years totaling approximately million 
the company strongly disagrees with the position taken by the ftb and plans to formally appeal the assessments before the sbe 
an unfavorable ruling against the company may have a material impact on the company s quarterly results of operations 
management believes that the issue will ultimately be resolved in favor of the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail on this matter 
the company is also involved in proceedings incidental to its insurance business 
see item legal proceedings  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
 and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates  among other factors  can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
inflation is reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
the company performs its own loss reserve analysis and also engages the services of independent actuaries to assist in the estimation of loss reserves 
the company and the actuaries do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates but rather calculate a point estimate 
management reviews the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the reserve estimate 
these include paid and incurred loss development factors  expected average costs per claim  inflation trends  expected loss ratios  industry data and other relevant information 
at december   the company recorded its point estimate of approximately  million in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which includes approximately million of incurred but not reported ibnr loss reserves 
ibnr includes estimates  based upon past experience  of ultimate developed costs which may differ from case estimates  unreported claims which occurred on or prior to december  and estimated future payments for reopened claims reserves 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provision 
for the year ended december   the company had positive development of approximately million on the and prior year loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which at december  totaled million 
the company attributes more than half of this redundancy to a change in the inflation rate assumptions used to establish bodily injury coverage reserves for the california automobile insurance lines of business for the and accident years 
the redundancies  related to changes in bodily injury inflation rate changes on the and accident years  were approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had estimated california automobile insurance bodily injury inflation rates of approximately on the and accident years 
at december   these assumptions were reduced to deflation amounts of approximately negative for the accident year and approximately negative for the accident year 
the company changed its inflation assumptions based on factors that continued to develop throughout these included a favorable trend in the average amounts paid on closed claims for the and accident years and increased certainty in reserve amounts that comes through the passage of time as more claims from an accident period are closed 
bodily injury inflation for the most recent accident years is one of the most difficult components of the company s reserves to estimate because a large portion of the claims have not yet been settled 
as time passes and more claims from an accident year are settled  the actual inflation rate becomes more certain 
since there are still a significant amount of open bodily injury claims for the and accident years  it is possible that inflation rate assumptions will change as more claims are settled in the future 
in addition  approximately one third of the positive development on the reserves established at december  relates to a reduction in the loss adjustment expense reserves for the california automobile insurance lines of business 
during the year ended december   there was a decrease in the expenditures to outside legal counsel for the defense of personal automobile claims in california 
this led to a reduction in the ultimate expense amount expected to be paid out and therefore a redundancy in the reserves established at december  the company believes that many factors could be contributing to the reduction in payments to outside legal counsel 
these include cost savings from the usage of more flat fee billing arrangements with outside counsel  faster closure rates of bodily injury liability cases and a decrease in bodily injury claims frequency due to factors such as improvements made in vehicle safety 
the company had smaller redundancies and deficiencies in its other coverages offered within its california automobile insurance line of business  as well as in other lines of business in california and other states 
when aggregated  these account for the remainder of the positive reserve development experienced in the positive development in total was more than offset by the reserve needs for the current accident year 
for the year ended december   the company s loss reserves as estimated at december  produced a redundancy of approximately million which was reflected in the financial statements as a reduction to the calendar year incurred losses 
the company attributes most of this redundancy to a change in the inflation rate assumptions used to establish reserves on the bodily injury coverage for california private passenger automobile insurance on the and accident years 
at year end  the company had assumed bodily injury severity inflation on california private passenger automobile insurance of on the accident year  on the accident year and on the accident year 
at year end  these assumptions were reduced to for  for and for the company reduced the inflation rate assumptions based on factors that emerged during including moderating to decreasing average amounts paid on closed claims in the and accident years and increased certainty in reserve amounts that comes through the passage of time as more claims from an accident period are closed 
the change in these inflation assumptions accounted for approximately million of the decrease in the expected ultimate loss on the reserves established at december  each percentage point change in the inflation rate assumption accounts for approximately million of the redundancy on the accident year losses and approximately million on the accident year losses 
the remainder of the redundancy for the accident year primarily occurred in the company s california homeowners and florida personal automobile lines of business 
california homeowners had approximately million in reserve redundancy and florida personal automobile had approximately million in reserve redundancy 
at december   the company assumed bodily injury inflation rates of approximately on the accident year for the california automobile lines of business 
the company estimates that each percentage point change in the inflation rate assumption would impact the through accident years by approximately million individually with a compounding effect if adjusted for multiple accident years 
for example  if all years were changed to  would be affected by million  by million and by million for a total of approximately million 
the company complies with the sfas no 
definition of how insurance enterprises should recognize revenue on insurance policies written 
the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies  that is  in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable  then a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business 
the company carries its fixed maturity and equity investments at market value as required for securities classified as available for sale by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

in most cases  market valuations were drawn from trade data sources 
in no case were any valuations made by the company s management 
equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are  with minor exceptions  actively traded on national exchanges or trading markets  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
the company constantly evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines and writes them off as realized losses through the consolidated statement of income  as required by sfas no 
 when recovery of the net book value appears doubtful 
temporary unrealized investment gains and losses are credited or charged directly to shareholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable taxes 
it is possible that future information will become available about the company s current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value 
the financial statement effect would be to move the unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet to realized investment losses on the consolidated statement of income 
the company may have certain known and unknown potential liabilities that are evaluated using the criteria established by sfas no 
these include claims  assessments or lawsuits relating to our business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the financial statement footnotes if they meet the requirements stated in sfas no 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  management does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated operations or financial position 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased from the corresponding period in net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts written in the premium increases were principally attributable to increased policy sales 
during  the company had no rate increases in california and implemented automobile rate increases in three of the twelve non california states 
net premiums written is a non gaap financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any reinsurance 
net premiums written is a statutory measure used to determine production levels 
net premiums earned  the most directly comparable gaap measure  represents the portion of premiums written that are recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policies

as described above  net premiums written is a non gaap financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any reinsurance 
net premiums written is a statutory measure used to determine production levels 
net premiums earned  the most directly comparable gaap measure  represents the portion of premiums written that are recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policies 
the following is a reconciliation of total company net premiums written to net premiums earned s for the years ended december  and  respectively net premiums written increase in unearned premiums earned premiums the loss ratio gaap basis in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was in compared with in the lower loss ratio is largely attributable to improved loss frequency on automobile claims and california homeowners claims 
automobile loss frequencies can be affected by many factors including seasonal travel  weather and fluctuations in gasoline prices 
the florida hurricanes negatively impacted the loss ratio by points compared to the points negative impact that the southern california firestorms had on the loss ratio 
furthermore  positive development on prior accident years reduced the loss ratio by points and adverse development on prior accident years increased the loss ratio by points

liquidity and capital resources mercury general is largely dependent upon dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries to pay debt service costs and to make distributions to its shareholders 
under current insurance law  the insurance companies are entitled to pay  without extraordinary approval  dividends of approximately million in the actual amount of dividends paid from the insurance companies to mercury general during was million 
as of december   mercury general also had approximately million in fixed maturity securities  equity securities and cash that could be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for the insurance companies are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for the insurance companies are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general and the purchase of investments 
through the insurance companies  the company has generated positive cash flow from operations for over twenty consecutive years  in excess of million every year since and over million for each of the past three years 
during this same period  the company has not been required to liquidate any of its fixed maturity investments to settle claims or other liabilities 
because of the company s long track record of positive operating cash flows  it does not attempt to match the duration and timing of asset maturities with those of liabilities 
rather  the company manages its portfolio with a view towards maximizing total return with an emphasis on after tax income 
combined with cash and short term investments of million at december   the company believes its cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments 
however  the company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs  including future business expansion  through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions 
net cash provided from operating activities in was million  an increase of million over the same period in this increase was primarily due to the growth in premiums reflecting increases in both policy sales and rates partially offset by an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses paid in the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities primarily to increase its investment in fixed maturity securities  the purchase and development of information technology such as the nextgen computer system and the payment of dividends to its shareholders 
excess cash was invested in short term cash investments 
funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of fixed maturity investments of  million  were primarily reinvested by the company in high grade fixed maturity securities 
the market value of all investments held at market as available for sale exceeded amortized cost of  million at december  by million 
that net unrealized gain  reflected in shareholders equity  net of applicable tax effects  was million at december   compared with million at december  at december   the average rating of the  million bond portfolio at market amortized cost  million was aa  the same as the average rating at december  bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically  within the tax exempt sector 
holdings in the taxable sector consist principally of investment grade issues 
at december   bond holdings rated below investment grade totaled million at market cost million representing of total investments 
this compares to approximately million at market cost million representing of total investments at december  the following table sets forth the composition of the investment portfolio of the company as of december  amortized cost market value amounts in thousands fixed maturity securities us government bonds and agencies municipal bonds mortgage backed securities corporate bonds redeemable preferred stock equity securities common stock public utilities banks  trusts and insurance companies industrial and other non redeemable preferred stock short term cash investments the following table illustrates the gross unrealized losses included in the company s investment portfolio and the fair value of those securities  aggregated by investment category 
the table also illustrates the length of time that they have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of december  less than months months or more total unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value amounts in thousands us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities redeemable preferred stock subtotal  debt securities equity securities total temporarily impaired securities the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statement of income 
the company s methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and the company s intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow the company to recover its costs 
the company recognized million and million in realized losses as other than temporary declines to its investment securities during and  respectively 
at december   the company had a net unrealized gain on all investments of million before income taxes which is comprised of unrealized gains of million offset by unrealized losses of million 
unrealized losses represent of total investments at amortized cost 
of these unrealized losses  approximately million relate to fixed maturity investments and the remaining million relate to equity securities 
approximately million of the unrealized losses are represented by a large number of individual securities with unrealized losses of less than of each security s amortized cost 
of these  the most significant unrealized losses relate to one corporate bond and one municipal bond with unrealized losses of approximately million and million  respectively  representing market value declines of and of amortized cost 
the remaining million represents unrealized losses that exceed of amortized costs  the majority of which have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months

the shares purchased were retired 
no stock has been purchased since the naic utilizes a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements that are compared to the company s actual capital level 
the formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has calculated the risk based capital requirements of each of the insurance companies as of december  each of the insurance companies policyholders statutory surplus exceeded the highest level of minimum required capital 
the company has no direct investment in real estate that it does not utilize for operations

petersburg  florida and a  square foot office building in oklahoma city  oklahoma

the company is currently developing a next generation nextgen computer system to replace its existing underwriting  billings  claims and commissions legacy systems that currently reside on hewlett packard mainframe computers 
the nextgen system is designed to be a multi state  multi line system that is expected to enable the company to enter new states more rapidly  as well as respond to legislative and regulatory changes more easily than the company s current systems 
the nextgen system is initially being deployed for the personal automobile line of business and has been successfully implemented in one state virginia 
the company expects to implement nextgen in its other states in and the company has currently spent approximately million on nextgen and expects additional costs to be incurred during the implementation period 
nextgen is expected to provide a positive benefit to the company 
as with any large scale technology implementation  risks associated with system implementation can occur that could significantly impact the operations of the company and increase the expected costs of the project  although management has expended planning and development efforts to mitigate these risks 
the company has obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years after years amounts in thousands debt including interest lease obligations losses and loss adjustment expenses total contractual obligations notes to contractual obligations table the amount of interest included in the company s debt obligations was calculated using the fixed rate of on the senior notes and libor plus basis points or at december  on its mortgage note 
the company is party to an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligations on its senior notes for a floating rate of six month libor plus basis points 
using the effective annual interest rate of in  the total contractual obligations on debt would be million with million due within year  million due between and years  million due in years and and million due beyond years 
the company s outstanding debt contains various terms  conditions and covenants which  if violated by the company  would result in a default under the debt and could result in the acceleration of the company s payment obligations thereunder 
unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and loss adjustment expenses do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and loss adjustment expense payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all of the insurance companies of  million at december   and net premiums written for the twelve months ended on that date of  million  the ratio of premium writings to surplus was approximately to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised approximately of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities account for approximately of total investments at market value 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that utilizes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
however  due to the current interest rate environment  management has taken steps to reduce the duration of the company s bond portfolio 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
consequently  the modified duration of the bond portfolio has declined to years at december  compared to years and years at december  and  respectively 
given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio at december  would decrease by approximately million 
at december   the company s strategy for common equity investments is an active strategy which primarily focuses on current income with a secondary focus on capital appreciation 
the value of the equity investment consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to u 
s 
treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 
at december   the duration on the company s non sinking fund preferred stock portfolio was years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value at december  by approximately million  with all other factors remaining constant 
the common equity portfolio  representing approximately of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility and energy sector common stocks 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on its million fixed rate senior notes for a floating rate 
the interest rate swap has the effect of hedging the fair value of the senior notes
