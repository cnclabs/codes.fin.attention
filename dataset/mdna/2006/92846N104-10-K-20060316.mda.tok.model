critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report describe our significant accounting polices used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe the critical accounting polices listed below reflect significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors  including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific client reserves and the aging of our outstanding receivables 
this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary in the period such determination has been made  which would impact future results of operations 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  for gross accounts receivable of million 
deferred taxes significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
our methodology for determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our core business  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of each balance sheet date  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
although we had cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the three years ended december   we did not pay any significant income taxes for that period due to tax deductions from the exercise of stock options as well as our utilization of net operating losses 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of each balance sheet date  we considered evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
the primary evidence considered included the cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the past three years  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december   and the estimated future taxable income based on historical operating results 
after giving consideration to these factors  we concluded that it was more likely than not that tax loss carryforwards will be realized prior to expiration and other tax credits that expire prior to will not be utilized due to the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  as well as utilization of tax loss carryforwards 
as a result  we have a valuation allowance of  as of december  relating to net operating losses and tax credits that expire prior to we also concluded that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  and the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  would be utilized prior to expiring 
based on this conclusion  we will require approximately million in cumulative future taxable income to be generated at various times over the next years to realize the related net deferred tax assets of million as of december  as well as the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding and in the money as of december  if we adjust either our estimates of future taxable income or tax deductions from the exercise of stock options down  or our stock price increases significantly without an increase in taxable income  causing us to believe that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the impairment is measured using the discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment of million  licensed technology of  and other intangible assets subject to amortization of million as of december  goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare the book value to the market value market capitalization plus a control premium 
if the market value exceeds the book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our book value exceeds the market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december   in which no impairment was identified 
goodwill was million as of december  agreement with r technology  inc in april  we entered into an agreement with r technology  inc r to market r s lung nodule cad software product to our customers 
the april agreement replaced our november agreement with r under the april agreement  all previous commitments were cancelled and replaced with a new commitment which began in the third quarter of the new commitment provides r with certain minimum quarterly revenues applicable minimums from the sale of certain r lung cad related products and services r lung cad products over a quarter period ending june  we will receive a commission based on sales of r lung cad products to our customers 
this agreement states that to the extent the quarterly applicable minimum is not met  we will pay r the difference between the applicable minimum and the actual r lung cad product revenue achieved 
the applicable minimums for the quarters ending december  and march  are  per quarter 
however  beginning in the quarter ending june  and for each subsequent quarter thereafter  the applicable minimum will be reduced to the lowest of i the applicable minimum in the preceding quarter  ii the applicable minimum of the preceding quarter multiplied by the percent by which the r lung cad product revenue in the preceding quarter fell below that quarter s applicable minimum  up to a maximum decline of twenty three percent  or iii two times the r lung cad product revenue generated by r during the preceding quarter through all other sales  marketing and distribution channels  excluding r lung cad product revenue generated from customers under the agreement 
if at any time during the remainder of the r agreement  the applicable minimum is less than  and r lung cad product revenue for a quarter exceeds  the applicable minimum for the next quarter will be  thereafter  the applicable minimums will be subject to the above adjustment 
additionally  at the end of every fourth quarter under the april r agreement  if the aggregate revenue generated under the agreement in the previous four quarters exceeded  the remaining applicable minimum per quarter shall be reduced by the amount of excess divided by the number of quarters remaining under the agreement 
the applicable minimum for the quarter ended december  was not met by approximately  and  based on current estimates  we believe it is probable that the estimated aggregate applicable minimums will not be met for the quarter ending march  additionally  we estimate that the applicable minimum will be after march   as  based on information available to us  r has not generated any r lung cad product revenue through any other sales  marketing and distribution channels  other than r lung cad product revenue generated from customers under this agreement 
based on these results and future estimates  we recorded a  net loss to sales and marketing expense in the quarter ended december  relating to this agreement to cover estimated losses through march  the  net loss is based on the fourth quarter of shortfall of  and first quarter of applicable minimum of  offset by the estimated forecasted revenues of  by the deferred commission fees on sales as of december  of  and estimated deferred commission fee on forecasted revenues of  however  the estimated aggregate applicable minimums are a subjective determination  and any changes to estimates and actual results could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   the remaining potential aggregate applicable minimums range from a minimum of approximately  to a maximum of approximately million 
any future losses will be recorded under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires the amount to be probable and estimable 
we have not recognized any commission revenue relating to this agreement  as it was not considered to be fixed or determinable due to the potential for payments by us to r relating to the applicable minimums 
revenue recognition we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  license revenue from resellers is recognized on a sell in or sell through basis depending on the arrangement with the reseller 
we recognize revenue from resellers on a sell in basis provided the reseller i assumes all risk of the purchase  ii has the ability and obligation to pay regardless of receiving payment from the end user  and iii has a history of timely payments 
license fees revenue is derived from the licensing of computer software 
hardware revenue is derived from the sale of system hardware  including peripheral equipment 
maintenance and service revenue is derived from software maintenance and from telephone support  installation  training and consulting services 
our software licenses are always sold as part of an arrangement that includes maintenance and support and often installation and training services 
we license our software and sell products and services to end users and also indirectly through original equipment manufacturers oems and independent distributors collectively  resellers 
terms offered by us do not generally differ based on whether the customer is an oem  an end user or a reseller 
we generally offer terms that require payment within to days after product delivery 
in rare situations where we offer terms that require payment beyond days after product delivery  revenue is deferred until the payment becomes due 
we do not generally offer rights of return  acceptance clauses or price protection to our customers 
in rare situations where we provide rights of return or acceptance clauses  revenue is deferred until the clause expires 
we evaluate the credit worthiness of all customers 
in circumstances in which we do not have experience selling to a customer and lack adequate credit information to conclude that collection is probable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fees are collected and all other revenue recognition criteria in the arrangement have been met 
additionally software and hardware revenue from license fees and hardware is recognized when shipment of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to product implementation remain and our services are not considered essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
services revenue from maintenance and support arrangements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support arrangements 
revenue from training  installation and consulting services is recognized as the services are provided to customers 
multiple element arrangements we enter into arrangements with customers that include a combination of software products  system hardware  specified upgrades  maintenance and support  or installation and training services 
for such arrangements  we recognize revenue using the residual value method 
we allocate the total arrangement fee among the various elements of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each of the undelivered elements determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
the fair value of maintenance and support services is based upon the renewal rate for continued service arrangements 
the fair value of installation and training services is established based upon sold separately pricing for the services 
in software arrangements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence is determined for the undelivered elements residual method or when all elements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value have been delivered 
results of operations the following table sets forth information from the company s statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of total revenue

license fee revenue increased to million from million in license fee revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in license fee revenue was driven by an increase in the number of vitrea licenses sold and an increase in average revenue per vitrea license sold due to an increase in the sales price and an increase in the percentage of license revenue generated outside of our toshiba relationship  as sales through toshiba have lower average revenue per transaction 
the installed base of vitrea customers increased from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  and to approximately  at december  revenue from vitrea licenses increased to million in from million in  which was a decrease of from million in vitrea option revenue including third party software increased to million in from million in  which was a increase from million in in  software license fee revenue from sales through our distribution partnership with toshiba increased to million in from million in  which was a increase from million in license fee revenue from toshiba represented  and of license fee revenue  respectively

the increases in maintenance revenues in each year were due to a significant increase in our installed base of customers  as well as increased pricing on maintenance related services 
the increase in training revenue and installation revenue was due to an increase in the number of vitrea licenses sold each year 
hardware revenue decreased to million in compared to million in hardware revenue increased to million in compared to million in we sell hardware as a convenience to our customers  and fluctuations are driven by individual customer purchasing preferences 
sales of hardware systems are not core to our strategy and will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the needs of our customers 
cost of revenue gross profit increased to million in compared to million in gross profit increased to million in compared to million in gross margin percentage increased to in compared to in  which was a decrease from in a comparison of gross profit and gross margin by revenue category is as follows for the years ended december  gross profit license fees maintenance and services hardware total gross profit gross margin license fees maintenance and services hardware total gross margin license fee gross margins increased to in compared to in the increase in was due to an increase in average revenue per vitrea license sold due to an increase in the sales price and an increase in the percentage of license revenue generated outside of our toshiba relationship  as sales through toshiba have lower average revenue per transaction  an increase in total vitrea option revenue  which has lower associated costs  and a decrease in the sales of third party software options  which carry a lower margin than software that has been developed internally 
license fee gross margins decreased to in compared to in the decrease in was due to an increase in the cost of third party software  which was up million over  and an increase of  in amortization expense related to acquired hinnovation intangible assets 
in addition  royalties paid to third parties who supply technology that is embedded in our products was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in royalty expense is a direct result of selling more vitrea licenses 
amortization charged to cost of revenue related to the hinnovation acquisition was million   and in  and  respectively 
as revenue continues to increase  amortization expense as a percentage of license revenue will decrease 
as a result of third party software sales and revenue mix  license fee gross margin will continue to fluctuate based on these factors 
maintenance and services gross margin increased to in compared to in margins on maintenance and services increased to in from in the increases in both and were due to increased pricing on maintenance services and increased revenue from a growing installed base  without an increase in costs at a similar rate 
we will continue to invest in our training  installation  professional services and customer support areas in the future to adequately support our growing installed base of customers  as well as to evaluate maintenance and services pricing as our cost structure increases  which could have an impact on maintenance and services gross margins in the future 
hardware gross margin increased to in compared to in hardware gross margin increased to in from in hardware gross margin was historically volatile but has stabilized in as pricing has increased and has become more consistent 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in sales and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the increases in expenses for all periods were due to increases in compensation costs as a result of additional personnel  higher sales commission expenses from significantly increased revenue and higher costs related to supporting our presence at an increased number of industry tradeshows 
salaries  benefits and bonus related expenses  excluding commissions  increased  to million in compared with million in  and increased million to million in compared to million in  with the increases being driven primarily by additional personnel required to drive and support our rapid growth

we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in future periods primarily as a result of the need to support additional growth through the hiring of sales and marketing personnel 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the increases in expenses for all periods were due in part to increases in compensation costs as a result of additional personnel 
salaries  benefits and bonus related expenses increased  to million in compared with million in  and increased  to million in compared to million in the increases were caused primarily by the costs of additional personnel to continue expanding our product development efforts 
we had  and research and development personnel as of december   and  respectively 
in addition  contract and consulting costs increased  to  in compared to  in  and increased  to  in compared to  in  as we continue to require additional temporary assistance in completing certain research and development activities  specifically in the area of software testing and validation 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods primarily as a result of additional personnel required to support the expansion of our product development activities so that we can maintain our status as an industry leader in advanced visualization 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively

there were  and general and administrative personnel as of december   and  respectively 
in addition  because of increasing regulatory requirements  including sarbanes oxley  fees related to audit and legal services and contract and temporary workers increased  to million in  compared with  in and increased  in compared with the increases were offset in part by a net  fluctuation in bad debt expense related to the recovery of previously reserved for receivables 
in  bad debt expense increased by  as a result of the establishment of reserves for specific past due accounts 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in future periods primarily as a result of additional personnel required to support increasing regulatory requirements  and as the costs of being a public company continue to rise 
other items loss on operating lease in march  we signed a non cancelable operating lease for a new office facility in minnetonka  minnesota 
the new lease term started in february and expires in january we moved into the minnetonka location and moved out of the plymouth  minnesota location in february our lease for the office facility in plymouth expired on july   with the exception of a small portion of the space that is under lease until may  under the terms of the minnetonka lease  since february  the lessor is to pay the monthly base rent payments and taxes and operating cost rent obligation payments for our former office in plymouth 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a lease loss of  related to the abandonment of the plymouth office 
the estimated lease payments to be made by the minnetonka landlord to the plymouth landlord are considered a lease incentive and recorded as an immediate charge and deferred rent  which is amortized as a reduction of rent expense through the term of the lease 
acquired in process research and development results for the first quarter of included a million write off of in process research and development costs related to the hinnovation acquisition 
interest income we generated million of interest income in  compared with  in and  in the increases were primarily due to increases in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which were generated from increased cash flows in all periods  and an increase in interest rates 
income taxes our methodology for determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our core business  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of each balance sheet date  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
although we had cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the three years ended december   we did not pay any significant income taxes for that period due to tax deductions from the exercise of stock options as well as our utilization of net operating losses 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of each balance sheet date  we considered evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
the primary evidence considered included the cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the past three years  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december   and the estimated future taxable income based on historical operating results 
after giving consideration to these factors  we concluded that it was more likely than not that tax loss carryforwards will be realized prior to expiration and other tax credits that expire prior to will not be utilized due to the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  as well as utilization of tax loss carryforwards 
as a result  we have a valuation allowance of  as of december  relating to tax credits that expire prior to we also concluded that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  and the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  would be utilized prior to expiring 
based on this conclusion  we will require approximately million in cumulative future taxable income to be generated at various times over the next years to realize the related net deferred tax assets of million as of december  as well as the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding and in the money as of december  if we adjust either our estimates of future taxable income or tax deductions from the exercise of stock options down  or our stock price increases significantly without an increase in taxable income  causing us to believe that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
during  we concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of our net deferred tax assets would be realized  and we reversed substantially all of our valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  which resulted in the recording of a net tax benefit in the reversal of the deferred tax assets valuation allowance was based upon our historical operating performance and management s expectation that we would generate taxable income of at least million in future periods to allow us to realize the deferred tax assets resulting from the tax benefits associated with our net operating loss carryforwards and a significant portion of our research and development tax credit carryforwards  as well as certain other tax benefits related to book and tax income timing differences 
the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a tax benefit of million 
this reversal  net of other current year state and federal income taxes  resulted in a net tax benefit of million in our effective income tax rate was   and in  and  respectively 
as noted above  we recorded a net tax benefit in relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance  which resulted in abnormal effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate of in was impacted by the mix between our us operating results  for which we record income taxes  and our foreign operating results  for which we did not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of realizing these tax benefits in future years in our foreign jurisdictions 
during  we completed a transfer pricing study for our foreign operations in china  which resulted in a more normalized tax rate of 
based on current estimates  we anticipate an effective income tax rate of approximately to in the increase in the estimated effective tax rate is due to the expiration of the research and development r d tax credit on december   the r d tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by four percentage points 
there is current legislation in congress that would extend the r d tax credit and  if approved  we would expect an effective tax rate between and in we do not anticipate paying any significant income taxes for the next three to six years due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax deductions from the exercise of stock options 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in marketable securities  working capital of million and no borrowings  as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents  million in marketable securities  working capital of million and no borrowings as of december  operating activities during  cash provided by operations was million  which consisted of a decrease of  from changes in working capital accounts  an increase of million in deferred rent relating to payments and estimated payments to be made by our minnetonka landlord for our benefit  and an increase of million from other operating activities 
changes in working capital accounts primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million due to increased sales and an increased customer base 
days sales outstanding as of december  increased to days  compared to days as of december   which increased as a result of a significant portion of sales occurring in the third month of the fourth quarter of our aging remains relatively current with less than of receivables greater than days past due as of december  and we use days sales outstanding as an activity measure which places emphasis and focus on accounts receivable  but the measure used by us is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles  and similarly titled measures may not be computed the same by other companies 
other changes in working capital accounts included a decrease in prepaid and other current assets of  an increase of  in accounts payable due to increased operating costs and general timing of payments to vendors  and an increase of million related to accruals for bonuses and royalty payments 
during  cash provided by operations was million  which consisted of an increase of million in working capital accounts and million in cash flow from other operating activities 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to our significant overall revenue increase in the fourth quarter of versus the same period in the increase in deferred revenue was due to the increase in maintenance and services on a year over year basis and an overall increase in customer base to which these services are sold 
the increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily due to an overall increase in operations and the general timing of cash disbursements in the fourth quarter of cash flows from other operating activities in consisted primarily of non cash expenses related to the amortization from identified intangibles and an in process research and development charge related to the february hinnovation acquisition  an increased provision for doubtful accounts related to the establishment of reserves for specific customer accounts  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and a tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options 
days sales outstanding as of december  increased to days compared to days as of december  cash provided by operations was million in  which consisted of an increase in working capital accounts of  in and cash flow from other operating activities of million in investing activities we used million  million and million of cash in investing activities in  and  respectively 
we used million  million and million for purchases of property and equipment in  and  respectively 
the purchases for all periods were principally to upgrade computer equipment and to purchase computer equipment for new personnel 
in addition  we purchased furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements related to our move to our minnetonka headquarters in the first quarter of and expansions of our former facilities in and we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods are difficult to predict and depend on a number of factors  including the hiring of employees and the rate of change of computer hardware 
we used million  million and million to purchase investments in marketable securities during  and  respectively 
we realized million  million and million of proceeds from sales of marketable securities during  and  respectively 
the marketable securities consist of us government obligations  us government agency obligations  corporate commercial obligations and certificates of deposits 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the acquisition of hinnovation  inc in accordance with the terms and conditions of an acquisition agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of january   using million of cash 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities in and resulted primarily from the exercise of stock options granted under our stock plans and upon the exercise of warrants 
of the cash provided by financing activities during  million consisted of net proceeds  after deducting offering costs of million  from our private placement in june of million shares of common stock at per share 
a registration statement covering the resale of these shares was declared effective on september  by the securities and exchange commission 
effective march   we de registered the resale of these shares not already sold 
we have never paid or declared any cash dividends and do not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations  including purchase commitments  at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
total year or less to years to years more than years operating leases we currently lease our office facilities in minnetonka  minnesota under a lease that expires in january in march  we signed a non cancelable operating lease for this new office space 
the new lease term started in february and expires in january under the terms of the new lease  the lessor for the minnetonka office began making the minimum lease payments for our former facilities located in plymouth  minnesota in february as part of the new lease  we are also required to pay a portion of the lessor s operating costs for the new facilities 
the minimum lease payments listed include both the plymouth and minnetonka office locations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new lease 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or contingent consideration related to acquisition we have a contingent consideration agreement related to our acquisition of hinnovation  inc in february the maximum potential contingent consideration was initially million 
no contingent consideration has been earned  and  as of december   the potential maximum contingent consideration is million  which consists solely of cash 
the remaining milestone upon which contingent consideration may be earned is related to porting our base software to hinnovation s web based platform and the commercial launch thereof 
a second milestone  based upon achieving certain revenue targets for the hinnovation products by march  was not met and expired 
a third milestone  based on the licensing of products based on patents held by hinnovation by february  was not met and expired 
any contingent payments made by us will result in an equivalent increase in goodwill 
agreement with r technology  inc in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  loss on contract relating to our agreement with r technology  inc see critical accounting policies and estimates agreement with r technology  inc for further discussion 
as of december   the remaining potential aggregate applicable minimums range from a minimum of approximately  to a maximum of approximately million 
other purchase commitments we had no significant outstanding purchase orders as of december  we have entered into a number of technology licensing agreements that provide for the payment of royalties when we sell vitrea 
except for the r purchase commitment described above  we are not obligated for any minimum payments under such agreements 
other matters if our operations progress as anticipated  of which there can be no assurance  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and generated from operations should be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including commitments  for at least the next months 
the timing of our future capital requirements  however  will depend on a number of factors  including the ability and willingness of physicians to use advanced visualization and analysis software in clinical analysis  surgical planning  patient screening and other analysis and treatment protocols  our ability to successfully market our products  our ability to differentiate our volume rendering software from competing products employing surface rendering or other technologies  our ability to build and maintain an effective sales and distribution channel  the impact of competition in the medical visualization business  our ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals  and our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products on a timely basis 
to the extent that our operations do not progress as anticipated  additional capital may be required 
there can be no assurance that any required additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all  and the failure to obtain any such capital would have a material adverse effect on the business 
foreign currency transactions substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
inflation we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 which requires recognition of an expense when goods or services are provided 
sfas no 
r requires the determination of the fair value of the share based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
sfas no 
r permits a prospective or two modified versions of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original sfas no 
in april  the sec adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january   at which time we will begin recognizing an expense for unvested share based compensation that has been issued or will be issued after that date 
we have determined that we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method under which we will apply sfas no 
r to new awards granted after the adoption of sfas no 
r and any portion of existing awards that were granted after december  and have not vested by the date we adopt sfas no 
r 
we expect the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate that equity based compensation charges in will be approximately million to million after tax  depending on the stock price when new options are granted and the volume and timing of incentive stock option exercises  all of which are difficult to predict 
these factors can also affect our effective tax rate 
future stock based compensation will differ from pro forma amounts see note schedule labeled stock based compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we do not enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates because  as disclosed above  substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
based on the controls in place and the relative size of the financial instruments entered into  we believe the risks associated with not using these instruments would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we do not engage in speculative transactions and do not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and price changes  that could affect our operating results 
as of december   fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates and price changes would not have had a material effect on our financial position or operating results 
interest rate risk we place our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which generally have a term of less than one year  with a high quality financial institution and have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
if  during  average short term interest rates decreased by from average rates  based on our quarterly average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our projected interest income from short term investments would have decreased by approximately foreign currency risk substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to other foreign currencies have not had an effect on our results of operations or financial condition
