item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included in part ii  item of this form k 
management s discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  this performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
some of the important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ from those discussed are listed under item a risk factors 
results of operations through our subsidiaries  we operate in three reportable segments friction products  precision components and performance racing 
our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  general customer demand for our products  competition  raw material pricing and availability  labor relations with our personnel  political conditions in the countries in which we operate and general economic conditions 
we sell a wide range of products that have a corresponding range of gross margins 
our consolidated gross margin is affected by product mix  selling prices  material and labor costs as well as our ability to absorb overhead costs resulting from fluctuations in demand for our products 
in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell our motor segment  which had operations in alton  illinois and monterrey  mexico 
this segment  which manufactures die cast aluminum rotors for fractional and sub fractional horsepower electric motors  failed to achieve a certain level of profitability  and  after completing an extensive analysis  we determined that a divestiture of this segment would allow us to concentrate on our core segments of friction products and precision components 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold certain fixed assets of our alton  illinois facility  which had been previously adjusted to their fair market value as of december  in addition  we recognized a fair market value adjustment loss of million million  net of tax on the sale of the land and building of this facility  which was included in the results of discontinued operations 
we continue to actively negotiate the sale of the monterrey  mexico facility and anticipate selling the remaining portion of the business during the first half of we restated our results of operations for this segment to reclassify its net operations  assets and liabilities as discontinued for all periods presented in this report and these results are not included in this discussion of our results of operations 
also in the fourth quarter of  we committed to a restructuring program to achieve cost savings in our friction products segment by moving operations at our brook park  ohio location to a new production facility in tulsa  oklahoma 
manufacturing in the oklahoma facility began in late and the facility became operational in additionally  we completed the closure of our brook park  ohio operation during the fourth quarter of when fully operational  we expect annual savings of approximately million from the new facility 
in connection with the closure of the ohio facility  we reported pre tax restructuring costs of million million is included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and million in the comparable period of related to relocation and employee severance expenses 
in  our income from operations decreased million to million  or  from the prior year 
this decrease in operating income was primarily the result of the direct restructuring costs  operating inefficiencies and duplicate manufacturing costs associated with the transition of operations to our new oklahoma manufacturing facility from ohio 
in addition  we incurred increased loan forgiveness costs and research and development spending 
these increased costs were partially offset by sales increases in most of our end markets and favorable product mix 
outlook for based on our current view of the markets we serve  and new business awarded by customers during  we believe that our net sales will increase between and to between million and million compared to net sales of million 
we expect that we will continue to see strength through in the majority of our end markets including  construction and mining  heavy duty truck  specialty friction and fluid power 
furthermore  we expect that our net sales will be positively impacted by continued new business awards in all of our business segments  increased sales in the friction products segment direct aftermarket and continued strong performance from our international operations 
we expect our income from operations to increase to a range of million and million representing an increase of to from adjusted income from operations of million reported for the full year our adjusted income from operations in excludes restructuring charges of million related to the move of our friction products segment facility to oklahoma and other net costs of million relating to pension curtailment income and loan forgiveness costs 
our outlook gives continuing effect to the manufacturing start up costs we expect to incur at our oklahoma facility during the first and second quarters of the year 
we expect  that as a result of the above factors  our net income for will be in a range of 
to 
per fully diluted share 
our common stock outstanding during the period is estimated to be million fully diluted shares 
critical accounting policies some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
in applying these policies  we use our best judgment to determine the underlying assumptions that are used in calculating the estimates that affect the reported values on our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we consider relevant 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
however  historically our estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has transferred to our customer 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of companies we acquired over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of acquisition 
in accordance with sfas  our policy is to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or more frequently if there is a significant adverse event or change in the environment in which one of our business unit operates 
we will record an impairment loss in the period such determination is made 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future discounted cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on our experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation and competitive trends 
if actual results are materially different than the assumptions used  impairment could result 
we did not record any impairment charges in the periods ended december   and asset impairment 
we review long lived assets excluding goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation and competitive trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we did not record any impairment charges in any of the periods ended december   or pension benefits 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant elements in determining our pension income expense in accordance with sfas are the expected return on plan assets and appropriate discount rates 
we assumed that the expected weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets will be for based on our existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  we believe that our assumption of future returns is reasonable 
however  should the rate of return differ materially from our assumed rate we could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of our plans and our future pension expense 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
our cumulative unrecognized net actuarial loss on pension assets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities at their measurement date  december the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   we determined this rate to be 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  has been deferred as permitted by sfas income taxes 
our effective tax rate  taxes payable and other tax assets and liabilities reflect the current tax rates in the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting and income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate is substantially driven by the impact of the mix of our foreign and domestic income and losses and the federal and local tax rate differences on each 
sfas no 
 provides certain guidelines to follow in making the determination of the need for a valuation allowance 
we must show that taxable income is expected to be available for future periods sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary differences and carryforwards to not record an allowance 
we have identified strategies which  if implemented  would enable us to realize the aforementioned tax benefits  and therefore  we have determined that no valuation allowance is required as of december on june   the governor of ohio signed house bill into law which significantly changed the corporate tax structure in ohio 
the major provisions of the bill include phasing out the ohio franchise tax and phasing in a commercial activities tax 
the tax changes did not have a material effect on our tax provision for the year ended december  foreign currency translation and transactions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using period end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year 
gains or losses resulting from translation are included in a separate component of our shareholders equity 
other comprehensive income includes a translation loss of million for the year ended december  gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
sales or purchases in foreign currencies  other than the subsidiary s local currency  are exchanged at the date of the transation 
the effect of transaction gains or losses are included in other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations in and recent accounting developments 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas this statement addresses the accounting transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which a company incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
on april   the us securities and exchange commission sec announced a deferral of the effective date of sfas r for calendar year companies until the beginning of effective january   we have elected to expense employee stock based compensation using the fair value based method prospectively for all awards granted  modified  or settled on or after january  the fair value at the grant date of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expense associated with share based paymentsissued to employees will be included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning on january  we expect that our pre tax compensation expense for the year ended december  related to the implementation of sfas r will be approximately million 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of section contains provisions requiring an annual assessment by management  as of the end of the fiscal year  of the effectiveness of internal control for financial reporting 
section also requires attestation and reporting by independent auditors on management s assessment as well as other control related matters 
on march   the sec published a final rule extending for one year the compliance dates for non accelerated filers to report on internal control over financial reporting 
for these issuers  section now will be effective for fiscal years ending on or after july  at this time  we continue to qualify for non accelerated filer status and therefore  will not need to comply with section until december  our compliance initiatives are moving forward and we anticipate being compliant with requirements of section as of december in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage  and requires such costs to be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas will be effective for us beginning january  and we do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our continuing operations are organized into three strategic segments 
these segments include friction products  precision components and performance racing 
in the fourth quarter of we committed to selling our motor segment 
as a result  we have classified this business as discontinued 
net sales 
our consolidated net sales in were million  an increase of million or from the same period in we experienced sales increases in all of our segments  primarily as a result of the continuing economic expansion during in the industrial markets we serve  new product introductions and market share gains during the year 
net segment sales change change dollars in millions friction products precision components performance racing consolidated friction products 
net sales in the friction products segment  our largest  were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million in as a result of new product introductions  general economic expansion and market share gains  we experienced increases in most of our major markets  including construction and mining  heavy truck and aerospace  increased sales to the direct aftermarket 
this segment continued to experience strong sales growth from our international operations in net sales at our italian facility  on a local currency basis  increased in compared to  as a result of new product introductions and market share gains 
total shipments at our chinese facility  on a local currency basis  were up in compared to our sales to the construction and mining  our largest market  were up in compared to  as a result of strong economic conditions in that market as well as market share gains achieved by us 
our sales to the truck market increased by in compared to as our customers supported the continued growth in new truck builds and aftermarket service requirements to existing truck fleets during the year 
our sales to the aerospace market were up in compared to as world wide commercial air travel continued its positive growth trend 
our sales to the agriculture market decreased during the year as a result of a weak farm economies in north america and europe 
during  we continued to focus our efforts on the friction direct aftermarket that we service through the velvetouch and hawk performance brand names 
sales in this product category were up to million in compared to precision components 
net sales in our precision components segment were million in  an increase of compared to the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to continued improving conditions in the general industrial segments of the domestic economy served by this segment 
we experienced sales increases in the fluid power  automotive and power tool markets served by this segment 
these increases were partially offset by a slight decline in the lawn and garden and appliance markets during the year due primarily to a customer designed engineering change that eliminated a product previously supplied by us 
our precision component segment began production and sale of product from its new powder metal production facility in china during the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   total shipments from this facility  on a local currency basis  were up for the comparable period of performance racing 
net sales in our performance racing segment were million  an increase of compared to net sales of million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the introduction of new clutch and transmission products during the year 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million to million during  a decline compared to gross profit of million in our gross profit margin declined to of our net sales in compared to of our net sales in the decline is primarily the result of significant costs incurred during the year as a result of operating inefficiencies associated with the relocation of our ohio friction products facility to oklahoma  including increased labor  overtime  maintenance  training  freight and outsourcing costs as a result of the start up of operations in oklahoma and operating both the ohio and oklahoma facilities during the production transition period 
in addition we incurred phase in costs associated with our technology initiatives in our precision components segment and increased inventory reserves in our performance racing segment primarily as a result of rule changes in the racing circuits served by us that rendered portions of our inventory obsolete 
gross profit margin change friction products precision components performance racing consolidated friction products 
our friction products segment reported gross profit of million or of its net sales in compared to million or of its net sales in the decrease in our gross profit margin was primarily the result of operating inefficiencies and direct restructuring costs associated with the transition of operations to our new facility in oklahoma 
the decrease was partially offset by the impact of sales volume increases during the period and favorable product mix 
precision components 
gross profit in our precision components segment was million or of its net sales in compared to million or of its net sales in the decrease in this segment s margins was primarily the result of phase in costs associated with our new technology initiative  higher raw material and energy costs  continuing start up costs associated with this segment s operations in china and outsourcing costs required as a result of the overall segments sales volume increase to meet customer delivery schedules 
performance racing 
our performance racing segment reported gross profit of million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the decline in gross profit in was primarily the result of cost increases on certain driveline components  reserves created to reflect inventory rendered obsolete as a result of rule changes increased employee benefit costs and product mix 
selling  technical and administrative expenses 
selling  technical and administrative st a expenses increased million  or  to million in from million during as a percentage of net sales  st a decreased to in compared to in the slight increase in st a expenses resulted primarily from increased personnel costs to support the sales volume increase in each of our business segments marketing expenses to support our direct aftermarket marketing programs  higher levels of research and development spending and loan forgiveness costs during  offset by reductions in incentive compensation expense for the year 
incentive compensation expense declined in compared to levels 
we spent million  or of our net sales on product research and development in compared to million  or  in restructuring costs 
direct restructuring costs excluding the million recorded in our cost of sales for the year ended were million  consisting of severance  planning  recruiting  relocation and other costs associated with our new manufacturing facility in oklahoma 
in the comparable period of  we incurred direct restructuring costs of million 
the costs reflected in and are part of the same initiative relating to the closure of our brook park  ohio facility and its transition to the tulsa  oklahoma facility 
employee benefit curtailment 
as a result of employment reductions at our brook park  ohio facility as of september   we reduced an actuarially computed liability relating to a benefit no longer owed by us 
the benefit provided for medical benefits to individuals who met certain age and service requirements at termination of employment 
this action resulted in reported income of million for the year ended december  there were no employee benefit curtailment charges in income from operations 
income from operations decreased million or to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period of income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from in the comparable period of the decrease was primarily the result of direct restructuring costs  operating inefficiencies and duplicate manufacturing costs associated with the transition of operations to our oklahoma facility from ohio  increased loan forgiveness costs and increased research and development costs  partially offset by product mix and million of employee benefit curtailment income

hawk s primary source of funds for conducting its business activities and servicing its indebtedness has been cash generated from operations and borrowings under our bank facility and senior notes 
the following selected measures of liquidity and capital resources outline various metrics that are reviewed by our management and are provided to enhance the understanding of our business 
selected measures of liquidity and capital resources from continuing operations december dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents working capital current ratio to to net debt as a of capitalization average number of days sales in accounts receivable days days average number of days sales in inventory days days working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities 
current ratio is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities 
debt is defined as long term debt  including current portion  and short term borrowings  less cash 
capitalization is defined as debt plus shareholders equity 
as part of our working capital management program  we review certain working capital measures on a continuing basis 
the million decrease in our net working capital from december  resulted from increased payables and a reduction in our accounts receivable balances as of december  partially offset by increased inventory requirements to support our increased sales volumes and the inventory build to support the move to our new facility in oklahoma 
our accounts receivable and inventory levels are reviewed through the computation of days sales outstanding and inventory turnover  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days compared to days at december  the decrease is mainly attributable to a strong focus on accounts receivable collection efforts within our operating segments 
average inventory days improved to days at december  as compared to days at december  our overall inventory investment has increased approximately million at december  as compared to december  levels primarily to support our increased sales volumes and the inventory build to support the move to our new facility in oklahoma

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosres 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in seeking to minimize the risks and costs associated with market risk  we manage our exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financial activities and through foreign currency hedge contracts 
we had no foreign currency hedge contracts outstanding as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
as december   approximately  or million  of our total debt bears interest at a variable rate 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from december  levels  our additional annual interest expense would be less than million 
the interest rates on our long term debt reflect market rates and therefore  the carrying value of long term debt approximates fair value 
an analysis of our obligations is further discussed in note financing arrangements and note lease obligations in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the following table presents our total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  total thereafter contractual obligations short term debt bank facility senior notes operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations stand by letters of credit this contractual obligation table does not include our defined benefit pension obligations 
an analysis of our obligations under our defined benefit plans is contained in note employee benefits in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of this form k 
variable rate obligations the senior notes due november   accrue interest at a fixed rate of per annum or million per year 
purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for inventory purchases  services and capital expenditures under purchase order 
inflation risk 
we manage our inflation risks by ongoing review of product selling prices and production costs 
in spite of the recent surcharges and prices increases on a number of our raw materials  we do not believe that inflation risks are material to our business  its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of our receipts and expenditures are contracted in us dollars  and we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material at this time 
we have operations outside the united states with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in euros  canadian dollars  and chinese renminbi 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
we do not expect that our unhedged foreign currency balance sheet exposure as of december  will result in a significant impact on our earnings or cash flows 
we also monitor exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which hawk operates  and have periodically entered into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure 
as of december   we have no derivative instruments outstanding
