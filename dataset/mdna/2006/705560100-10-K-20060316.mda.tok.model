item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
except for historical information  the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of the fiscal year ended january  fiscal included weeks  the fiscal year ended january  fiscal included weeks  and the fiscal year ended december  fiscal included weeks 
company overview and industry outlook peet s is a specialty coffee roaster and marketer of fresh  deep roasted whole bean coffee sold through multiple channels of distribution for home and away from home enjoyment 
founded in berkeley  california in  peet s has established a loyal customer base with strong brand awareness in california 
our growth strategy is based on the sale of whole bean coffee and high quality beverages in multiple channels of distribution including our own retail stores  grocery  home delivery  and office and restaurant accounts throughout the united states 
our current expansion strategy is focused in the western united states  where we have strong customer awareness  loyalty and brand affinity 
in  the company made good progress in its strategy to build out its multiple channels in the western united states 
the results of the efforts in include opening new retail locations  of which were in california and the remaining two in the pacific northwest  expanding our grocery network to now include virtually all the grocery stores west of the rockies 
this helped drive over sales growth in our grocery business  committing to build and purchase a new roasting facility in alameda  california  which will enable our future growth needs for our west coast business  continuing the investment in the people and systems to prepare for the continued expansion of the brand  and delivering solid net revenue and earnings results as forecasted  as we have since we became a public company in all of these results have been achieved while continuing to provide our customers with the uncompromised quality of our coffee offerings 
we expect the specialty coffee industry to continue to grow 
we believe that this growth will be fueled by continued consumer interest in high quality coffee and related products 
we believe that by offering high quality products to consumers throughout the country  we will attract the same loyal customer base that we have attracted in california 
as we grow  our operations will continue to be vertically integrated  allowing us to control the quality of our product at all stages 
we purchase high quality arabica coffee beans from countries around the world  and we utilize our artisan roasting technique to bring out the distinctive flavor of our coffees 
because roasted coffee is perishable  we are committed to delivering our coffee under the strictest freshness standards 
as a result  we do not stock or inventory roasted coffee 
we roast to order and ship fresh coffee daily to our stores and customers 
control of purchasing  roasting  packaging and distribution of our coffee allows us to maintain our commitment to freshness  is cost effective  and enhances our margins and profit potential 

table of contents business segments our coffee and related items are sold through multiple channels of distribution that are considered separate segments under sfas no 
these channels provide broad market exposure to potential purchasers of fresh roasted whole bean coffee 
we are indifferent as to where consumers purchase our coffees and teas  and believe that our specialty and retail segments are synergistic 
however  we also recognize that the economics of our specialty business and retail stores are different enough that we have chosen to report them as separate channels 
therefore  we currently have two reportable segments  consisting of our retail stores  and specialty sales  which consist of sales to home delivery customers  sales to grocery stores  restaurant and food service companies and office accounts 
we believe growth opportunities exist in all these channels 
our expansion is focused geographically  not by segment 
our first priority is to develop the western us markets where we already have a presence and have higher customer awareness 
we will continue to open new stores in strategic locations that meet our demographic profile in these markets  make our coffees more broadly and conveniently located in grocery stores  and partner with distributors and companies who share our passion for quality and freshness and are willing and able to execute accordingly in the food service and office environment 
business categories in addition to our reportable segments  we measure our business by monitoring the volume and revenue growth of two distinct business categories whole bean coffee and related products  consisting of products for home brewing  tea and packaged foods  and beverages and pastries 
we believe these business categories are useful in understanding our results of operations for the periods presented because we operate our stores and record sales through these two categories 
our stores are primarily designed to facilitate the sale of fresh whole bean coffee 
the format of our stores replicates that of a specialty grocer 
beans are freshly scooped from bins under the counter  weighed on counter top scales and hand packed into branded bags 
in addition  our stores are also designed to encourage customer trial of our coffee through coffee beverages 
each store has a beverage bar that is dedicated to the sale of prepared beverages and artisan baked pastries

the increase in beverage and pastry sales was primarily caused by sales at the stores we opened in and  increased traffic in our existing stores  and a price increase in october the slower growth in whole bean and related products was due to continuing cannibalization of bean sales in retail stores as we increased the availability of peet s coffee in grocery stores and the lower mix of whole bean sales in our new stores

in addition  cost as a percentage of net revenue was lower than by due to the prior year lease accounting adjustment 
these cost decreases were partially offset by higher coffee and manufacturing costs and the opening of more new stores 
new stores increased cost as a percent of net revenue by because of their higher occupancy cost on a lower sales base 
in addition  increased manufacturing and packaging costs had a greater impact on costs as specialty became a larger part of the business 
lastly  higher coffee cost resulted in an additional increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net revenue

depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased in primarily due to the stores we opened during and investment income  net we currently invest in us government  agency  municipal and guaranteed student loan obligations 
investment income includes interest income and gains or losses from the sale of these instruments 
we earned million in interest income in  compared to million last year  primarily due to higher interest rates on our investments and a higher average investment balance 
income tax provision this year s effective income tax rate was in versus in the prior year 
our effective rate increased as we entered into a higher statutory income tax bracket 
the impact in of the benefits we realized from the new domestic production deduction and state enterprise zone credits were offset by the adjustment in from the removal of the valuation allowance on federal and state charitable contribution carryforwards 
we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately in weeks compared with weeks net revenue net revenue for increased versus as a result of continued expansion of our retail and specialty sales segments and the impact of an extra week in fiscal year the increase from the same weeks was as the extra week accounted for 
while in october  we increased prices of our beverages  whole bean coffee and tea  the impact of the increase on net revenue was minimal 
sales of whole bean and related products increased to million 
sales from beverages and pastries increased to million 
a key element of our multi channel strategy emphasizes the sales of whole bean coffee and related products

sales to the home delivery channel grew in as compared to as we continued to emphasize loyalty programs that reward customers who subscribe to our recurring order programs 
in addition  office coffee sales increased primarily due to our effort to expand distributorships and the stabilizing office population as the job market and the economy recover 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales and related occupancy expenses consist of product costs  including manufacturing costs  rent and other occupancy 
as a percent of net revenue  cost of sales increased from in to in due to the adjustment of million  or of net revenue  related to lease accounting 
this adjustment  which increased occupancy expenses  was the result of our review of our lease accounting initiated by a letter released on february  by the sec 
upon review of all of our leases  we determined that our previous methods of accounting for rent holidays and specific rent escalation terms were not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these changes do not impact the company s historic or future cash flow or the timing or amount of lease payments 
this increase as a percent of net revenue was partially offset by negotiated cost savings  waste reductions  and by the retail price increase we took at the end of october  in the retail segment  cost of sales and related occupancy expenses as a percent of revenue were flat in versus the prior year due to several offsetting items 
the lease accounting charge increased cost by

during the year  we limited our efforts primarily to new store openings and retaining existing customers 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for decreased  or million  as compared to the decrease was due to the net difference of million associated with the wage and hour lawsuit and severance expenses 
in  we recorded million for these costs

the impact on expenses as a percent of revenue was a decrease of to in  and an increase of to in offsetting the impact of these charges were increases in general and administrative expenses for investments in headcount to support our growth and higher audit and consulting fees to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased in primarily due to the stores we opened during and this increase was partially offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year

income tax provision the effective income tax rate for was versus in the prior year 
our effective rate was reduced primarily by the removal of the valuation allowance on federal and state charitable contribution carryforwards and the tax benefit provided by shifting more of our investments into federal and state tax exempt securities 
liquidity and capital resources at january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term and long term marketable securities for a total of million 
working capital was million as of january  compared to million at january   largely due to the short term nature of marketable securities

net cash used in investing activities was million in investing activities primarily relate to purchases of property and equipment  the escrow deposit for our new roasting facility  and maturities and purchases of marketable securities 
during  maturities net of purchases totaled million as we held a 
table of contents greater amount of cash and cash equivalents at year end than in the prior year due to the relative yields 
cash paid for property and equipment totaling million included million used for the buildout of new stores and remodel of existing stores  million used for food service kiosks  grocery displays and other equipment for specialty sales  million used for manufacturing plant capacity and additional machinery  and million used for website development  information technology support systems  and other software and hardware to support our growing infrastructure

approximately to million is expected to be used for the opening of to new retail stores scheduled for and expenditures for new stores in progress for the remaining is expected to be used for the remodeling of existing stores  equipment for the grocery channel  information technology enhancements and investments in our roasting plant 
on november   we entered into an agreement with harbor bay acquisition llc to purchase property in alameda  california for the purpose of operating a new roasting facility 
the agreement specifies that  upon completion of construction  the company will acquire approximately  square feet of land and a  square foot building with related site improvements as specified 
the harbor bay acquisition llc will manage the construction of the facility  which has been specifically designed for the company s needs  and upon successful completion  the company is obligated to purchase the facility and the land 
the facility is expected to be delivered to the company in december at which time the sale will be finalized 
the preliminary purchase price of the facility and the land is estimated at approximately million but may change as the result of a competitive bidding process whereby the general contractor will obtain bids from subcontractors for all major divisions of construction based on the final drawings and specifications prepared by the architect and approved by the company and the harbor bay acquisition llc 
as required by the agreement  the company initially deposited into escrow million 
prior to the start of construction  the company will be obligated to increase the escrow fund to approximately million 
other than for certain material breaches of the agreement by harbor bay acquisition llc  the deposit is non refundable 
in addition to the facility and the land purchase price  the company anticipates that it will incur additional capital expenses for equipment and improvements of approximately million to ready the facility for use 
while transitioning production and or office space  we will incur increased ongoing occupancy and depreciation expense as well as incur moving costs 
the company anticipates the plant to be at full production capability by april the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the company s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods as of january  in thousands payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years equipment operating leases retail store operating leases fixed price coffee purchase commitments land and facility purchase total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents for the next twelve months  we expect our cash flows from operations and cash and marketable securities to be sufficient for our operating and capital requirements  our share purchase program and our contractual obligations as they come due 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operation in recent years 
however  we cannot predict what effect inflation may have on our results of operations in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies inventory 
raw materials consist primarily of green bean coffee 
finished goods include roasted coffee  tea  accessory products  spices and packaged foods 
all products are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  except green bean and roasted coffee  which is valued at the average cost 
we continually evaluate the composition of our coffee related merchandise and mark down such inventory as needed 
our historical inventory write offs have been immaterial 
impairment of long lived assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss by a charge against current operations 
property  plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment 
cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
accrued workers compensation 
we record an estimated liability for the self insured portion of workers compensation claims 
the liability of million recorded as of january  is determined based on information received from our insurance carrier including claims paid  filed and reserved for and historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the settlement costs increase beyond what was anticipated  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
income taxes 
in establishing deferred income tax assets and liabilities  we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws and published tax guidance applicable to our operations 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
changes in our valuation of the deferred tax assets or changes in the income tax provision and reserves may affect our annual effective income tax rate 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to use fair value to measure stock based compensation awards and cease using the intrinsic value method of accounting used by the company 
compensation cost based on the fair value of the award will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the company will adopt sfas r beginning january   as required  using the modified prospective method 
in addition to the recognition of compensation expense in the financial statements  under sfas r  any excess tax benefits received upon exercise of options will be presented as a financing activity inflow rather than as an adjustment to operating activity as currently presented 
based on current analysis and information  management estimates that the adoption of sfas r will result in an increase in stock compensation expense ranging from to million and a decrease in net income per diluted share ranging from to in in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a legally required conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred  if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted fin in the quarter ended january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairments and its application to certain investments fsp 
fsp provides accounting guidance for identifying and recognizing other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities  as well as cost method investments in addition to disclosure requirements 
fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and earlier application is permitted 
the company adopted fsp during the fourth quarter ended january  the adoption of fsp did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in interest bearing  us government  agency  municipal and guaranteed student loan obligations 
these financial instruments are all subject to fluctuations of daily interest rates 
therefore our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from these changes 
the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility and can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries  including weather  political and economic conditions 
in addition  green coffee bean prices have been affected in the past  and may be affected in the future  by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence commodity prices of green coffee beans through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide 
we currently use fixed price purchase commitments  but in the past have used and may potentially in the future use coffee futures and coffee futures options to manage coffee supply and price risk 
fixed price and not yet priced purchase commitments we enter into fixed price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee beans and fix our cost of green coffee beans 
these commitments are made with established coffee brokers and are denominated in us dollars 
we also enter into not yet priced commitments based on a fixed premium over the new york c market with the option to fix the price at any time 
as of january   we had approximately million in open fixed priced purchase commitments and approximately in 
table of contents not yet priced commitments for a total of approximately million with delivery dates ranging from january through december we believe  based on relationships established with our suppliers  that the risk of non delivery on such purchase commitments is low 
coffee futures and futures options we may use coffee futures and futures options to reduce the price risk of our coffee purchase requirements that we cannot make or have not made on a contractual basis 
these instruments are traded on the new york coffee  sugar cocoa exchange 
we use these futures and options solely for financial hedging purposes and never take actual delivery of the coffee traded on the exchange 
these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are accounted for as inventory costs and are recorded as expense or income when the related coffee is sold 
the ineffective portion is recorded as an expense or income immediately 
the extent of our coffee futures and coffee futures options positions at any given time depends on the amount of coffee we have contracted to purchase  the amount of coffee qualified for hedge accounting and general market conditions and trends 
our hedging positions are only placed by the chief financial officer through one brokerage firm that we believe to be reputable 
as of january   we held no coffee futures or futures options 
we had no outstanding positions at january  or january  we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes
