item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a our business we design  manufacture and market automated systems for the collection  processing and surgical salvage of donor and patient blood  including the single use disposables used with our systems and related data management software 
our systems allow users to collect and process only the blood component s they target  plasma  platelets  or red blood cells  increasing donor and patient safety as well as collection efficiencies 
our systems consist of proprietary disposable sets that operate on our specialized equipment 
our data management systems are used by blood collectors to improve the safety and efficiency of blood collection logistics by eliminating previously manual functions at commercial plasma and not for profit blood banks 
we either sell our devices to customers equipment revenue or place our devices with customers subject to certain conditions 
when the device remains our property  the customer has the right to use it for a period of time as long as they meet certain conditions we have established  which among other things  generally include one or more of the following purchase and consumption of a minimum level of disposable products 
payment of monthly rental fees 
an asset utilization performance metric  such as performing a minimum level of procedures per month per device 
our disposable revenue stream including sales of disposables and fees for the use of our equipment accounted for approximately of our total revenues for fiscal year and for fiscal years and b product families our donor products include systems to collect plasma  platelets and red cells from blood donors 
we market our donor products primarily to blood collectors which include both for profit plasma collectors and not for profit blood banks 
our patient products include systems to collect during and after surgery  wash and filter unwanted substances from the blood  preparing it for reinfusion to the surgical patient 
we market these patient products to hospitals and hospital service providers 
miscellaneous and service revenue includes revenue generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings  as well as revenue from d software sales 
donor products plasma pcs plasma collection systems these systems are used by plasma collectors to collect the plasma component of a donor s whole blood 
the plasma is sold to fractionators for processing into therapeutic pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
automated plasma collection is a safe and cost effective improvement to manual non automated plasma collection which is time consuming  labor intensive  produces relatively poor yields  and poses risks to donors 
currently the majority of plasma collections worldwide are automated collections 
blood bank mcs platelet collection system these systems are used by blood collectors to collect the platelet component of a donor s whole blood 
platelets are transfused to cancer patients whose platelets have been depleted as a result of chemotherapy 
before the advent of our platelet collections technology  the pooling or combination of platelets from to different donors was the only alternative to prepare a single therapeutic dose for transfusion to a patient 
our mcs line of products allows the collection of a sufficient number of platelets from only one donor to produce one or two therapeutic doses 
acp cell processing systems these systems are used in freezing  thawing and washing of red cells  which enables blood collectors to better manage their red cell inventories 
in a liquid state  red cells must be transfused within days whereas frozen red cells may be stored for up to ten years 
previous generation freezing technology required that red cells be transfused within hours after thawing  our acp system allows red cells to be transfused for up to days post thaw 
intravenous solutions we manufacture intravenous and other solutions for use with our blood processing technology 
we also contract manufacturing intravenous solutions for pharmaceutical customers 
these solutions include generic drugs and other custom drug products 
red cell mcs red cell collection systems these systems are used to automate the collection of red cells from blood donors with protocols that allow for the collection of two units of red cells  a unit of red cells and a unit of plasma  or a unit of red cells and a unit of platelets 
the systems improve the blood collector s operational efficiency by increasing the volume of blood components collected per donation event and number of red cells than the traditional non automated collection method and helps blood systems address red cell shortages that commonly plague health care systems 
patient products surgical surgical blood salvage systems these systems are used by hospitals to collect a patient s own blood during or after surgery for reinfusion to the patient  mitigating or eliminating the need for transfusion of donated blood 
we market cell saver brand systems for higher blood loss procedures such as cardiovascular surgeries and the orthopat brand system for lower blood loss orthopedic surgeries 
the cardiopat brand system is our newest product  targeted at beating heart and other cardiovascular surgeries that result in bleeding during and after surgery

market trends plasma market the continued increase in demand for plasma derived pharmaceuticals  particularly intravenous immunoglobulin ivig  is a key driver of increased plasma collections in the worldwide commercial plasma collection markets 
various factors related to the supply of plasma and the production of plasma derived pharmaceuticals also affect the demand  including there has been significant industry consolidation among plasma collectors and fractionators 
industry consolidation impacts us when a collector changes the total number of its collection centers  the total number of collections performed per center or changes the plasma collection system haemonetics or competitive technology used to perform some or all of those collections 
the supply of source plasma also affects demand for additional collections of source plasma 
we believe that the inventory of source plasma has returned to normal levels in the us and in europe 
in japan  there is a still an oversupply of plasma 
the newer plasma fractionation facilities are more efficient in their production processes  utilizing less plasma to make similar quantities of pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
reimbursement guidelines affect the demand for end product pharmaceuticals 
in fiscal year  we completed the conversion of all zlb plasma services zlb collection sites to haemonetics collection technology based on the supply agreement signed with zlb plasma services zlb in fiscal year to be its exclusive supplier of plasma collection technology in the united states 
blood bank market despite modest increases in the demand for platelets in our major markets  improved collection efficiencies that increase the yield of platelets per collection have resulted in a flat market for disposables 
we continue to sell intravenous solutions that we produce under contract for pharmaceutical companies 
red cell market red cell demands  a need for greater operating efficiency  and a stringent regulatory environment continue to drive demand for our red cell products 
our business continues to grow as we gain new customers and expand penetration at existing customer sites 
additionally  sales continue to increase as more customers have migrated to our higher priced filtered disposable sets which support our customers good manufacturing processes by reducing manual processing 
surgical market our cell saver brand system is aimed at higher blood loss cardiovascular procedures 
this part of the surgical blood salvage market is declining and will probably continue to decline due to improved surgical techniques minimizing blood loss and a decrease in the number of open heart bypass surgeries performed 
the main driver of growth in the surgical market is the lower blood loss orthopedic procedures served by our orthopat system 
we have transitioned our selling method in the us from distributor to direct sales for the orthopat system 
in fiscal  we purchased a line of surgical products from harvest technologies corporation 
two products are in late stage development  but the first product resulting from the acquisition  the smartsuction harmony system  was launched in late fiscal the suction system  which replaces wall suction  removes blood and debris from the surgical field before the blood is processed in one of our surgical blood salvage systems

the favorable effects of foreign exchange resulted in a increase 
of the remaining increase  us revenues contributed almost and europe accounted for partially offset by a decline in japan of approximately 
the us increase is the result of market share growth over fiscal year due to the conversion to haemonetics systems by one very large customer zlb and increases in collections by other customers as the oversupply of source plasma that had existed in fiscal year tapered off 
conversely  in japan  fewer plasma collections were performed by our customer as compared to fiscal year due to an oversupply of plasma inventory

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our consolidated financial statements 
while all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap as outlined in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery  including customer acceptance  has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a very significant component of our results of operations 
we record software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and in instances where services are essential to the functionality of the software  as is the case in many of d software sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in accordance with sop  when the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees are dependent upon the performance of the services  the software license  configuration  training and implementation fees are recognized under the contract method of accounting using labor hours to measure the completion percentage 
in order to apply the contract method of accounting  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
on a quarterly basis  inventory quantities on hand are reviewed and an analysis of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory is performed based primarily on our estimates of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
in addition  as described in notes and of our consolidated financial statements  as a result of our acquisitions  values were assigned to intangible assets for patented and unpatented technologies and customer contracts and related relationships 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives were assigned to these intangibles and they will be amortized over their remaining life 
we review our intangible assets and their related useful lives at least once a year to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we conduct more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist  including a change in the competitive landscape  any internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies  a loss of a significant customer  or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products 
an impairment results if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and disposition of the asset 
the amount of the impairment would be determined by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the asset 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
the projection of the future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate require significant management judgment 
the key variables that management must estimate include sales volume  prices  inflation  product costs  capital expenditures and sales and marketing costs 
for developed technology patents and other technology that have not been deployed we also must estimate the likelihood of both pursuing a particular strategy and the level of expected market adoption 
significant judgment is involved in making these estimates 
future write downs may be required if the value of the assets become impaired 
in fiscal year  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to the excess of the carrying value over the fair market value of an intangible asset categorized as other technology 
the impairment was triggered by our re evaluation of our plans to deploy such technology 
cost method investment we account for our private equity investment in arryx  inc arryx in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock using the cost method as we do not exercise significant influence over operating or financial policies of this entity 
each reporting period  we evaluate our investment for impairment if an event or circumstance occurs that is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant deterioration in the business prospects of the investee  a significant adverse change in the economic or technological environment of the investee  and a significant doubt about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern 
if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the cost method investment  the fair value of the investment is not calculated as it is not practicable to do so in accordance with paragraphs and of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
if we identify an impairment indicator  we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value 
we have determined there are no impairment indicators present during on our cost method investment with a carrying value of million 
this investment is classified as other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
any change in conditions that would cause us to change our estimate as to the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly impact our depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
haemonetics equipment includes devices that we have placed at our customers under contractual arrangements that allow them to use the device in exchange for rental payments or the purchase of disposables 
in addition to periodically reviewing the useful lives of these devices  we also periodically perform reviews to determine if a group of these devices is impaired 
to conduct these reviews we must estimate the future amount and timing of demand for these devices 
changes in expected demand can result in additional depreciation expense  which is classified as cost of goods sold 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of equipment and our reported operating results 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  income tax expense is calculated for all jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are periodically evaluated to determine their recoverability 
a valuation allowance is established and a corresponding additional income tax expense is recorded in our consolidated statement of income if their recovery is not likely 
the provision for income taxes could also be materially impacted if actual taxes due differ from our earlier estimates 
as of april   a valuation allowance of 
million existed on our balance sheet 
the total net deferred tax asset as of april  was million 
we file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
we established reserves to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited 
these reserves have been established based on management s assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to permanent differences and interest applicable to both permanent and temporary differences 
all tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments made as events occur that warrant modification

contractual obligations and contingencies a summary of our contractual and commercial commitments as of april   is as follows for more information concerning our debt see note to the consolidated financial statements and for our operating lease obligations see note payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years after years debt operating leases purchase commitments total includes amounts we are committed to spend on purchase orders entered in the normal course of business for capital equipment and for the purpose of manufacturing our products including contract manufacturers  specifically nova biomedical  for the purchase of devices and jms co 
ltd  and kawasumi laboratories for the manufacture of certain disposable products 
the majority of our operating expense spending does not require any advance commitment 
contingent commitments as a result of our fiscal year license arrangement for blood processing technology  our fiscal year acquisition of d  and our fiscal year agreement with baxter related to pathogen reduction technology  we are contingently obligated to make certain payments 
the fiscal year license arrangement involves certain potential payments of up to million if the technology reaches certain performance milestones 
in addition  if the specified deliverables are completed  the agreement calls for minimum royalty payments for future commercial sales of products that incorporate this technology 
the d acquisition involves certain potential payments of up to million  of which million has already been paid 
our future potential obligation is million  should sales of the d software products exceed certain cumulative levels prior to the end of fiscal year the pathogen reduction agreement calls for us to make total potential payments of up to million of which million has already been paid as and if regulatory approvals are received in various markets 
see  however  legal proceedings at page  regarding our arbitration claim related to this agreement with baxter related to pathogen reduction 
if haemonetics is successful in the arbitration the contingent payments called for in the agreement could be decreased or eliminated 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented  although the increased cost of oil has increased our costs for products which are petroleum based  particularly resin used in our disposable products  and increased freight and transportation costs 
historically  we believe we have been able to minimize the effects of inflation by improving our manufacturing and purchasing efficiency  by increasing employee productivity and by adjusting the selling prices of our products 
in the future  given the risk of continued pronounced oil price increases  inflation may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
foreign exchange approximately of our sales are generated outside the us in local currencies  yet our reporting currency is the us dollar 
our primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the japanese yen and the euro 
foreign exchange risk arises because we engage in business in foreign countries in local currency 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency and expenses incurred by local sales offices 
however  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on our results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
hedging through the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates  but because we generally enter into forward contracts one year out  rates are fixed for a one year period  thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation 
we enter into forward contracts that mature one month prior to the anticipated timing of the forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges intended to lock in the expected cash flows of forecasted foreign currency denominated sales at the available spot rate 
actual spot rate gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in sales  at the same time the underlying transactions being hedged are recorded 
we compute a composite rate index for purposes of measuring  comparatively  the change in foreign currency hedge spot rates from the hedge spot rates of the corresponding period in the prior year 
the relative value of currencies in the index is weighted by sales in those currencies 
the composite was set at based upon the weighted rates at march  the composite rate is presented in the period corresponding to the maturity of the underlying forward contracts 
the favorable or unfavorable changes are in comparison to the same period of the prior year 
a favorable change is presented when we will obtain relatively more us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
an unfavorable change is presented when we obtain relatively fewer us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
these indexed hedge rates impact sales  and as a result also gross profit  operating income and net income  in our consolidated financial statements 
the final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results

sfas no 
requires that the effect of the change be reported retrospectively to prior periods unless it is impracticable to determine the period by period effect of the change and or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period by period effect of the change  the statement requires that the effect of the change be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities in the earliest period for which retrospective application is practical and the offset be made to retained earnings or other appropriate equity account 
in the case where it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change  the statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied prospectively from the earliest practicable date

for all unvested awards that were granted to employees prior to january  the company expects to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a negative impact on our results of operations  although it will have no material impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement no

however  had statement no 
r been effective in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no

cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements contained in this report  as well as oral statements we make which are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed  and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions  and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations  and financial position 
these statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of our actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include technological advances in the medical field and our standards for transfusion medicine and our ability to successfully implement products that incorporate such advances and standards  product demand and market acceptance of our products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic and political conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the impact of industry consolidation  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns  the effect of industry consolidation as seen in the plasma market  the effect of communicable diseases and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including europe and asia in which we operate 
the foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due principally to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk see the section entitled foreign exchange for a discussion of how foreign currency affects our business 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
we do not use the financial instruments for speculative or trading activities 
at april   we held the following significant foreign exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales outstanding hedged currency buy sell local currency weighted spot contract rate weighted forward contract rate fair value maturity euro apr may euro june aug euro sep nov euro dec feb japanese yen per us per us apr may japanese yen per us per us june aug japanese yen per us per us sep nov japanese yen per us per us dec feb we estimate the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all forward contracts would result in a million increase in the fair value of the forward contracts  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts 
interest rate risk all of our long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on our interest expense amounts 
the fair value of our long term debt  however  does change in response to interest rates movements due to its fixed rate nature 
at april   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair market is entirely related to our million  fixed rate senior notes and our million  real estate mortgage 
at april   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair market is entirely related to our million  fixed rate senior notes and our million  real estate mortgage 
using scenario analysis  if we changed the interest rate on all long term maturities by from the rate levels that existed at april  the fair value of our long term debt would change by approximately million 
concentration of credit risk and significant customers financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  accounts receivable and investment in sales type lease receivables 
sales to one unaffiliated japanese customer  the japanese red cross society  amounted to million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
accounts receivable balances attributable to this customer accounted for   and of our consolidated accounts receivable at fiscal year   and  respectively 
while the accounts receivable related to the japanese red cross society may be significant  we do not believe the credit loss risk to be significant given the consistent payment history by this customer 
certain other markets and industries can expose us to concentrations of credit risk 
for example  in our commercial plasma business  we tend to have only a few customers in total but they are large in size 
as a result  our accounts receivable extended to any one of these commercial plasma customers can be somewhat significant at any point in time
