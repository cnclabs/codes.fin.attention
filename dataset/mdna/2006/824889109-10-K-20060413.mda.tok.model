item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
overview shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers 
as of january   we operated stores in states in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our ability to identify and react to fashion changes is a key factor in our sales and earnings performance 
our marketing effort targets middle income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively and earn attractive store level returns 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers who choose to serve themselves 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
our fiscal year consists of a week period ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to the fiscal years  and relate respectively to the fiscal years ended january   january   and january  fiscal years  and consisted of weeks 
fiscal year will end on february   and will consist of weeks 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgements in our reported financial results 
these judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgements are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred 
we evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when events such as these occur  the assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgement and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
deferred income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgements and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
we anticipate that future taxable income  and prior year taxable income during loss carryback periods  will not be sufficient to recover the full amount of deferred tax assets 
therefore  a valuation allowance has been provided for certain state operating losses recorded as a deferred tax asset 
our effective tax rate considers our judgement of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax 
we have also been involved in tax audits 
at any given time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
outlook we plan to make several infrastructure enhancements in fiscal to enable us to pursue more aggressive expansion opportunities in fiscal and beyond 
in fiscal  we intend to open between and new stores and close five stores 
we will continue to back fill underpenetrated markets and open smaller  one or two store markets in relatively close proximity to existing markets 
new support facilities in fiscal  construction has begun on a new distribution center and will begin on a new corporate headquarters as our future store expansion plan requires additional distribution capacity 
our current corporate headquarters and distribution center are located in a combined facility on a lot of approximately acres 
in mid february  we signed a year lease with a real estate developer who will construct  to our specifications  a new distribution center of approximately  square feet located on a acre lot in the evansville  indiana area 
this location has ready access to i  a major east west interstate  and also has the potential for rail utilization 
we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures to equip this facility 
we selected tilt tray technology to replace our current pack by light system for the handling and packaging of shoes into store specific assortments as directed by our merchandisers 
this technology will allow us to process product through the distribution center at a higher rate 
once operational  the distribution center is anticipated to support the needs of approximately stores 
the lease provides for the option of expanding the facility to accommodate the processing needs of approximately stores 
we also plan to occupy a new corporate headquarters in the evansville  indiana area by the end of the first half of fiscal it is our intention to lease this new facility 
we currently utilize approximately  square feet for our administrative offices 
in order to allow for necessary expansion  our new headquarters will be approximately  square feet 
we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures on furniture and fixtures for this facility 
in february  we sold our current combined distribution center and corporate headquarters and entered into a lease to continue occupancy until such time as our new facilities are available 
the initial lease term expires on january   however the lease has an option that allows us to continue our occupancy until january   if necessary 
it also provides for early termination upon our relocation to new facilities 
information technology in  we will be implementing a wide area network  providing connectivity between our headquarters  distribution center and our stores 
this technology will provide the platform for immediate operational enhancements in the areas of credit and debit exchange fees and provide the infrastructure necessary to further evolve the communication between our many support departments and the operational side of our business 
in the late spring of  we will also begin utilizing markdown optimization software 
we expect to significantly enhance our gross profit margin potential with this software and its consequential operating changes 
we intend to also use this software as a platform to implement a regional pricing strategy 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense net income before income taxes income tax expense net income compared to net sales in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales 
net sales increased million to million in fiscal  an increase over net sales of million in fiscal of the increase  million was attributable to the sales generated by the stores opened in fiscal  the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in fiscal  and partially offset by seven store closings 
the balance of the increase was attributable to a comparable store sales increase of 
in the last half of fiscal  we undertook two initiatives 
the first was to enhance the fashion content of our men s and women s non athletic product and the second was to improve the way in which we advertise to our customers 
in fiscal  our focus on these initiatives led us to the best year  from a sales and earnings perspective  in our history 
the record comparable store sales gain for fiscal was due to the results achieved in both our women s and men s non athletic business 
our men s non athletic product had a comparable store sales increase of 
our women s non athletic product had an even greater comparable store sales increase of 
as we look forward to fiscal  the focus will remain on increasing our brand recognition  as well as improving the fashion aspect of our business to drive comparable store sales gains through a combination of increased unit sales and growth in average price points 
gross profit our gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from a gross profit of million in fiscal our gross profit margin  as a percentage of sales  rose to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased and buying  distribution and occupancy costs decreased 
the decrease in buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  was due primarily to leveraging occupancy costs against a higher sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of this increase was directly attributable to operating the new stores opened in fiscal and fiscal net of seven store closings in fiscal 
we also incurred an increase of million in health care costs and an increase of million for incentive compensation in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in incentive compensation was primarily a result of higher operating earnings  which is the major component of our performance based incentive plans 
during fiscal  we incurred million in store closing costs related to seven fiscal store closings and impairment charges for three stores expected to be closed in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred  in store closing costs for six stores that were closed in fiscal and fiscal the year over year increase is primarily attributable to impairment charges for three stores we expect to close in fiscal barring any additional closings  we anticipate that our remaining fiscal store closing costs will be less than  the aggregate of pre opening expenses for the new stores in fiscal was approximately  or of sales  and was million  or of sales  for the new stores in fiscal our average pre opening costs per store dropped by nearly in fiscal to  from  in fiscal approximately of this decrease was due to an increase in cooperative advertising dollars received from our vendors and differences in advertising costs in markets where we have opened new stores 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from the prior year at 
this percentage decrease was primarily due to leveraging expenses against a larger sales base 
however  this leveraging was partially offset by a increase in employee healthcare and a increase in incentive compensation  both as a percentage of sales 
the increase in incentive compensation as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of higher operating earnings  which is the major component of our performance based incentive plans currently in place 
interest expense net interest expense decreased to  net of interest income of  in fiscal from  net of interest income of  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to lower average borrowings in addition to an increase in interest income 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit 
in fiscal  increases in state income taxes are expected to increase the effective income tax rate to between and compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  a increase over net sales of million in fiscal of the increase  million was attributable to the sales generated by the stores opened in fiscal  the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in fiscal  and partially offset by four store closings 
this increase was offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 
while sales of athletic footwear and accessories in our comparable stores increased slightly for the fiscal year  our men s  women s and children s non athletic footwear categories each experienced declines in comparable store sales 
in the first two quarters of fiscal  we saw declines in our comparable store sales  but ended the year with back to back quarterly comparable store sales gains 
we believe the improved sales performance in the second half of the year was at least partly due to enhancing the fashion content of our merchandise offering and to improving the way we advertise to our customers 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit of million in fiscal our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased and buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
the increase in the merchandise margin as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by a decline in the amount of markdowns necessary to liquidate seasonal product 
the increase in buying  distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales was due to a lack of sales leverage on occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we experienced a million increase in expense directly attributable to the operation of the stores opened in fiscal and fiscal  net of store closings 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in health care costs as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we incurred  in asset retirement costs on store closings  relocations and remodels as compared to  in fiscal the aggregate of pre opening expenses for the new stores opened in fiscal was approximately million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  for the new stores in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses remained unchanged from the prior year at 
interest expense net interest expense decreased to  net of interest income of  in fiscal from  net of interest income of  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to lower average borrowings in addition to an increase in interest income 
the weighted average interest rate on total debt was in fiscal and in fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was in both fiscal and fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows s fiscal years net income plus depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes lease incentives changes in operating assets and liabilities other operating activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal these amounts reflect the income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities between the two respective periods related primarily to the increase in net income in addition to the slowed growth in inventory associated with a reduced pace of store openings 
this increase in cash was partially offset by the timing of the payment of accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
working capital increased to million at january  from million at january   primarily from a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the current ratio at january  was as compared to at january  long term debt as a percentage of total capital long term debt plus shareholders equity was at january  we had no long term debt at january  capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal no capital lease obligations were incurred during this three year period 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  approximately million was incurred for new stores  million for store remodeling and a relocation  and million for software and information technology 
the remaining capital expenditures in fiscal were incurred for in store graphics and miscellaneous equipment purchases 
lease incentives received from landlords were   and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal of this amount  approximately million represents our projected investment in equipment for our new distribution center and approximately million for furniture and fixtures for our new corporate headquarters 
we intend to open to stores at an expected aggregate cost of between million and million 
the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels  visual presentation enhancements and various other store improvements  along with continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital expenditures for a new store in fiscal are expected to average approximately  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal on a per store basis  for the stores opened during fiscal  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion  the capital investment required for both the new distribution facility and corporate headquarters and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
significant contractual obligations as of january  and the periods in which payments are due include s payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years letters of credit operating leases purchase commitments deferred compensation total contractual obligations our unsecured credit facility provides for up to million in cash advances on a revolving basis and commercial letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit line are based on eligible inventory 
the agreement governing the credit facility stipulates a minimum threshold for net worth  a maximum ratio of funded debt plus rent to ebitda plus rent  and a maximum of total distributions for stock repurchases and cash dividends 
we were in compliance with these requirements as of january  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
the credit agreement and amendments thereto are filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were million at january  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit is subject to frequent borrowing and or repayment activities which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of january   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
on march   the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to april  during fiscal  we completed negotiations to assign two of our store operating leases  from stores closed in fiscal  to a third party 
the assignments legally obligate the assignee to assume all obligations under the leases 
as assignor  we remain secondarily liable on the leases during the base terms which end on january  and  respectively 
in our secondary position  we believe it is unlikely that we would be required to cure any event of default 
the minimum future lease payments assumed by the assignee approximated million at january  and such amounts are not included in the above table of our contractual obligations 
operating lease payments related to our existing headquarters and distribution center as well as our new distribution facility were not included in the above table of our contractual obligations as these leases were executed subsequent to january  had the new distribution facility lease been executed prior to the fiscal year end  the operating lease payments identified in the above table would have increased in total by million  with  represented in the less than year classification  million in each of the years and years classifications and approximately million in the after years classification 
likewise  the short term lease on our existing headquarters and distribution center would represent approximately  in operating lease payments for fiscal a lease has not yet been entered into for our new corporate headquarters 
see notes and to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item for a discussion of long term debt and leases  respectively 
except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at january  or january  seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in note summary of significant accounting policies contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
a change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the credit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal
