purpose of discussion 
we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our company and the critical economic factors that affect our company 
in addition  we hope to help the reader understand our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
executive overview dollar general corporation dollar general or the company is the largest dollar store discount retailer of consumable basics in the united states  with over  stores 
we are committed to serving the needs of low  middle and fixed income customers 
however  the company sells quality private label and national brand products that appeal to a wide range of customers 
our merchandise is priced at competitive everyday low prices that do not change frequently as a result of promotional activity 
we believe many of our customers shop at dollar general because they trust us to consistently stock quality merchandise at low prices 
we also believe convenience  or the ability to complete a shopping trip in a limited amount of time  is critical to many of our customers and is a key factor that differentiates us from large box retailers 
we operate in the highly competitive retail industry 
we face strong sales competition from other retailers that sell general merchandise and food 
because of dollar general s low price strategy  we must strive to keep our operating costs as low as possible 
this effort affects all expenses  but is particularly critical as we compete for retail site locations and for qualified talent to manage and operate our stores 
the fact that many of our stores are located in towns that many retailers may find too small to support their business model  however  has allowed dollar general to continue to increase its store count faster than most retailers 
management of the company continues to focus on making good investment decisions for the long term growth and profitability of the company 
in order to better support sales efforts in our stores and to enable the company to continue its rapid growth  the company has attempted to strengthen the senior leadership team over the last several years 
in  changes were made to the organization structure in order to increase synergies between store operations and new store development and among merchandising  marketing and the supply chain 
executives were added to support our efforts in human resources  real estate  store operations  supply chain and the dollar general market concept 
going forward  the company expects these new leaders to have a positive impact on the overall performance and profitability of the company 
along with other retail companies  we are impacted by a number of factors including  but not limited to cost of product  consumer debt levels  economic conditions  customer preferences  unemployment  labor costs  inflation  fuel prices  weather patterns  insurance costs and accident costs 
key items in fiscal despite a difficult economic environment for our customers in  the company successfully implemented many of the important operating initiatives outlined in last year s form k  while also increasing sales and earnings per share 
the following are some of the more significant accomplishments during the year total sales increased by percent  including sales during the rd week  and same store sales increased by percent  we opened new stores  including dollar general market stores  we implemented ezstore  the company s initiative designed to improve inventory flow from distribution centers to consumers as well as improve other areas of store operations  including labor scheduling  hiring and training and product presentation  in  stores as of year end  we completed construction of and opened the company s eighth dc in south carolina and began construction of a ninth dc in indiana to increase overall distribution capacity and to decrease stem miles between the dcs and the stores  we increased annual inventory turns to times in  including the rd week  from times in and reduced inventory levels on a per store basis by as of year end 
the company has executed end of season markdowns over the past two years to minimize seasonal inventory carried forward to the following year 
the company made substantial progress on this initiative in and continues to aggressively identify  evaluate  merchandise and markdown aged inventory  we introduced dollar general gift cards before the christmas holiday season  we introduced fisher price branded children s apparel and bobbie brooks apparel for women in our stores  we developed and installed new systems to provide enhanced store operating statements  supplier communications and transportation and claims management  and we generated sufficient cash flow to allow the company to repurchase approximately million shares of its common stock for million and to increase our per share dividend to shareholders by over 
the company believes its sales particularly in more discretionary  higher gross profit categories were negatively impacted by the effect on its typical low to middle income customer of high gasoline and heating fuel prices as well as higher interest rates and increasing consumer debt levels 
the company s gross profit rate was negatively impacted for the year by several factors as further discussed in results of operations below  but was most notably affected by the decrease  as a percentage of sales  in sales of higher gross profit merchandise categories and higher transportation fuel costs 
in  hurricanes katrina and rita made landfall in the gulf coast  impacting our operations  our customers  and our employees 
at the peak  approximately stores were temporarily closed due to hurricane katrina and stores were temporarily closed due to hurricane rita 
the company ultimately closed stores as a result of the hurricanes  and suffered the total destruction of inventory in of those stores due to hurricane katrina and of those stores due to hurricane rita 
significant losses of inventory and fixed assets  in the form of store fixtures and leasehold improvements  were caused by the hurricanes 
these losses were offset by insurance proceeds received during the year 
in addition  the company expects to record additional insurance proceeds in excess of the cost of the asset losses in the future 
significant business interruption was experienced du ring the hurricanes 
the company did not recover any business interruption insurance proceeds during the year  and will not record any such proceeds until the business interruption claims are substantially settled 
company performance measures 
management uses a number of metrics  including those indicated on the table included in results of operations below  to assess its performance 
the following are the more frequently discussed metrics earnings per share eps growth is an indicator of the increased returns generated for the company s shareholders 
eps of in reflected an increase of percent over eps of reported in total net sales growth indicates  among other things  the success of the company s selection of new store locations and merchandising strategies 
total net sales increased in  including the impact of the rd week 
same store sales growth indicates whether our merchandising strategies  store execution and customer service in existing stores have been successful in generating increased sales 
same store sales increased percent in  with stronger same store sales in the first half of the year than the latter half 
sales were negatively impacted for the year by the economic factors discussed above 
however  the latter half of the year was increasingly impacted by promotional efforts of competitors 
same store sales in increased by percent 
operating margin rate operating profit divided by net sales  which is an indicator of the company s success in leveraging its fixed costs and managing its variable costs  declined to percent in versus percent in the various components impacting this metric are fully discussed in results of operations below 
free cash flow the sum of net cash flows from operating activities  net cash flows from investing activities and net cash flows from financing activities  excluding share repurchases and changes in debt other than required payments 
although this measure is a non gaap measure  the company believes it is useful as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company s operations 
it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant non cash component to the company s net income 
the company generated free cash flow of million in compared to million in  as calculated below under non gaap disclosures 
inventory turns cost of goods sold for the year divided by average inventory balances  at cost  measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters is an indicator of how well the company is managing the largest asset on its balance sheet 
inventory turns were times in  including the rd week  compared to times in return on average assets net income for the year divided by average total assets  measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters  is an overall indicator of the company s effectiveness in deploying its resources 
return on assets was percent in and percent in while the company is particularly pleased with the improvement in inventory management and free cash flow generation  we did not achieve our overall internal financial goals set out at the beginning of the year 
this shortfall was partially a result of non controllable economic and other factors that impacted our customers 
as a result of the company s inability to achieve its financial targets  executives and administrative employees did not earn a bonus under the company s teamshare bonus program 
the company has identified the following opportunities aimed at improving financial performance in key items for fiscal for  the company has established the following priorities and initiatives aimed at continuing the company s growth and improving its operating and financial performance while remaining focused on serving its customers improvement in sales performance of same stores and new stores through new merchandise additions  improved in store presentation  and heightened promotional energy aimed at increasing customer traffic and average customer ticket 
the company plans to strengthen its treasure hunt offering and to execute a variety of new marketing  promotional and or advertising strategies 
the company will also implement a new store floor plan in all new stores  emphasizing improved merchandising adjacencies  operational efficiencies and customer service  and will continue efforts referred to as project gold standard begun in to improve the shopability and financial performance of existing stores  further development of the dollar general market concept  continued investment in ezstore  further reducing store labor and related costs  with the goal of completing the rollout by the end of  increased efforts to control inventory shrink in the stores  which remains above acceptable levels as a percentage of sales  opening a minimum of new traditional dollar general stores  while continuing to pursue further geographical expansion  with increased emphasis on site selection  approval processes  and lowering rent as a percentage of sales in new and existing stores  and continued investment in the company s infrastructure  including increasing global sourcing  further developing our information technology capabilities  and opening the company s ninth distribution center thereby expanding distribution capacity 
the company can provide no assurance that it will be successful in executing these initiatives  nor can the company guarantee that the successful implementation of these initiatives will result in superior financial performance 
results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein

net sales 
increases in net sales resulted primarily from opening additional stores  including net new stores in  and a same store sales increase of for compared to same store sales calculations for and prior include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year 
same store sales increases are calculated based on the comparable calendar weeks in the prior year 
accordingly  the same store sales percentage for discussed above excludes sales from the rd week as there was no comparable week in the increase in same store sales accounted for million of the increase in sales 
stores opened since the beginning of  as well as the million impact of the rd week of sales in fiscal year for all stores were t he primary contributors to the remaining million sales increase during the increase in same store sales is primarily attributable to an increase in average customer purchase 
the company has recently revised and published its method for determining the stores that are included in the company s publicly released same store sales calculations 
beginning in fiscal  the company now provides same store sales calculations for those stores that have been open at least full fiscal months and remain open at the end of the reporting period 
using the revised methodology  the same store sales increase in was the company monitors its sales internally by the four major categories noted in the table above 
the company s merchandising mix in recent years has shifted to faster turning consumable products versus seasonal  home products and clothing 
this has been driven by customer wants and needs in the marketplace 
as a result  over the past three years the highly consumable category has become a greater percentage of the company s overall sales mix while the percentages of the seasonal  home products and basic clothing categories have declined 
accordingly  the company s sales increase by merchandise category in compared to was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category  which increased by million  or 
the company believes that future sales growth is dependent upon an increase in the number of customer transactions as well as an increase in the dollar value of th e average transaction 
the company continually reviews its merchandise mix and strives to adjust it when deemed necessary as a part of its ongoing efforts to improve overall sales and gross profit 
these ongoing reviews may result in a shift in the company s merchandising strategy which could increase permanent markdowns in the future 
the company s sales increase in compared to resulted primarily from opening additional stores  including net new stores in  and a same store sales increase of for compared to the increase in same store sales accounted for million of the increase in sales while stores opened since the beginning of were the primary contributors to the remaining million sales increase during the company s sales increase in was primarily attributable to the highly consumable category  which increased by million  or 
gross profit 
the gross profit rate declined by basis points in as compared with due to a number of factors  including but not limited to lower sales as a percentage of total sales in the company s seasonal  home products and basic clothing categories  which have higher than average markups  an increase in markdowns as a percentage of sales primarily as a result of the company s initiative to reduce per store inventory  higher transportation expenses primarily attributable to increased fuel costs  an increase in the company s shrink rate  and an estimated million reduction resulting from the expansion of the number of departments utilized for the gross profit calculation from to  as further described below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
these factors were partially offset by higher average mark ups on the company s beginning inventory in as compared with in and  the company experienced inventory shrinkage of and  respectively 
the gross profit rate increased basis points in as compared with although the company s gross profit rate was pressured by sales mix shifts to more highly consumable items  which typically carry lower gross profit rates  the company was able to more than offset this through increases in gross markups on all merchandise categories in more specific factors include higher initial mark ups on merchandise received during as compared with  achieved primarily from the positive impact of opportunistic purchasing  renegotiating product costs with several key suppliers  selective price increases  and an increase in various performance based vendor rebates  and higher average mark ups on the company s beginning inventory in as compared to  which represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time 
these components of gross prof it  which positively impacted the company s results  were partially offset by an increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales  resulting primarily from higher fuel costs in as compared to  and a nonrecurring favorable inventory adjustment in of million  representing a change in the company s estimated provision for shrinkage 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
the basis point decrease in sg a expense as a percentage of sales in as compared with was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to the following expense categories that either declined or increased less than the increase in sales employee incentive compensation expense decreased  based upon the company s fiscal financial performance  professional fees decreased  primarily due to the reduction of consulting fees associated with the ezstore project and fees associated with the company s initial sarbanes oxley compliance effort  and employee health benefits decreased  due in part to a downward revision in claim lag assumptions based upon review and recommendation by the company s outside actuary and decreased claims costs as a percentage of sa les 
partially offsetting these reductions in sg a were current year increases in store occupancy costs increased  primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company s leased store locations  and store utilities costs increased primarily related to increased electricity and gas expense 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales in as compared with was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the percent increase in sales store occupancy costs increased  primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company s leased store locations  purchased services increased  due primarily to fees associated with the increased customer usage of debit cards  professional fees increased  primarily due to consulting fees associated with both the company s ezstore project and compliance with certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  and inventory services increased  due to both an increased number of physical inventories and a higher average cost per physical inventory 
partially offsettin g these increases was a reduction in accruals for employee bonus expenses declined  primarily related to higher bonus expense in resulting from the company s financial performance during penalty expense 
during  the company recorded a charge of million relating to a civil penalty resulting from its agreement in principle with the securities and exchange commission sec staff to settle the matters arising out of a restatement of the company s financial statements for fiscal years and prior 
interest income 
the increase in interest income in compared to is due primarily to higher interest earned on short term investments due to increased interest rates on short term borrowings 
the increase in interest income in compared to is due primarily to interest income on certain notes receivable purchased in may relating to the company s south boston dc  as further discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense in is primarily attributable to a reduction in tax related interest expense of million  principally due to the reversal of interest accruals pertaining to certain income tax related contingencies that were resolved during the decrease in interest expense in compared to is due primarily to capitalized interest of million related to the company s dc construction and expansion projects in compared to million in and a reduction in amortization of debt issuance costs of million due in part to the amendment of the company s revolving credit facility in june the company had variable rate debt of million as of february  the remainder of the company s outstanding indebtedness at february  and all of its outstanding indebtedness at january  was fixed rate debt 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
while the and rates were similar overall  the rates contained offsetting differences 
non recurring factors causing the tax rate to increase when compared to the tax rate include a reduction in federal jobs credits of approximately million  additional net foreign income tax expense of approximately million and a decrease in the contingent income tax reserve due to resolution of contingent liabilities that is million less than the decrease that occurred in non recurring factors causing the tax rate to decrease when compared to the tax rate include the recognition of state tax credits of approximately million related to the company s construction of a dc in indiana and a non recurring benefit of approximately million related to an internal restructuring that was completed during excluding the non recurring items  the effective tax rate would have been approximately 
the rate was lower than the rate primarily due to the reversal of certain contingent income tax liabilities of approximately million in  when the company adjusted its tax contingency reserve based upon the results of two state income tax examinations 
the tax rate in was negatively impacted by the million penalty expense in  as discussed above  which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
in  the company recognized a reduction in its federal income tax expense of approximately million for federal jobs related tax credits 
of this amount  approximately million relates to the work opportunity tax credit wotc  the welfare to work credit wtw and the native american employment credit 
the federal law that provided for the wotc and wtw credit programs expired on december  for employees hired after that date 
credits can continue to be earned in for eligible employees that were hired prior to the december  date 
the federal law that provided for the native american employment credit expired for years beginning after december  the company s year without regard to when the employee was hired 
the company currently anticipates that congress will renew these credit programs on a retroacti ve basis  however  renewal cannot currently be assured 
should these credit programs not be renewed  the company currently anticipates a reduction in its credits of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition recent developments

the future rate of sales of this merchandise will be a key determinant of the rate of future markdowns 
cash flows from operating activities for compared to declined by million 
the most significant component of the change in cash flows from operating activities was an increase in inventory levels in total merchandise inventories at the end of were billion compared to billion at the end of  a percent increase  or a percent increase on a per store basis  with the remainder primarily attributable to growth in the number of stores 
the largest portion of the increase in inventories resulted from the company s focus on improving in stock levels of core merchandise at the stores 
new initiatives  including the expansion of the perishable food program and the addition of certain core apparel items  magazines and hispanic food items also contributed to the inventory increase 
in addition  due to an early easter in  the company received more seasonal merchandise for spring before the end of fiscal cash flows in increased by million over related to changes in income taxes payable  primarily due to a large payment of federal income taxes for that was made in cash flows in the period were positively impacted by an increase in net income of million driven by improved operating results as more fully discussed above under results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
in addition to the estimates presented below  there are other items within the company s financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined below 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used  the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole 
management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to them 
merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
under the company s retail inventory method rim  the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales 
the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending inventory valuation at cost 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted cost figures 
factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover  applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise  inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date  and inaccurate estimates of lower of cost or market lcm and or lifo reserves 
to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory  the company s rim calculation through the end of utilized departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross profit rates were grouped 
in  in order to further refine its rim calculation  the company expanded the number of departments it utilizes for its gross profit calculation from to the impact of this change on the company s consolidated statement of income for was an estimated reduction of gross profit and a corresponding decrease to inventory  at cost  of million 
other factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and the utilization of an independent statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation 
also  on an ongoing b asis  the company reviews and evaluates the salability of its inventory and records lcm reserves  if necessary 
the company calculates its shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period 
this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales and is determined by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period for each store 
beginning in  in an effort to improve this estimate  the company began applying store specific shrink rates to store specific sales generated subsequent to a given store s physical inventory 
prior to  the company applied a weighted average shrink rate to all company sales generated subsequent to physical inventories 
during  in an attempt to further refine its shrink accrual  the company changed from a store level shrink accrual to a store and department level shrink accrual 
to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual  the company s effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results 
although the company performs physical inventories in all of its stores on an annual basis  the same stores do not necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year  which could impact comparability in a given reporting period 
during  the company implemented an item level perpetual inventory system 
this system provides better information regarding the type of inventory that the company owns and improves the company s ability to estimate its shrink provision as discussed above 
the utilization of this improved information in the company s rim calculation resulted in a non recurring inventory adjustment of approximately million  which favorably impacted gross profit in the third quarter of property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost 
the company groups its assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provides for depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class  except for leasehold improvements  which are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
insurance reserves 
the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers compensation  employee health insurance  general liability  property loss and automobile coverage 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores 
provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by an independent actuary utilizing historical claim trends 
if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns  the company may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions  which could be material to the company s future financial results 
contingent liabilities income taxes 
the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
the company estimates its contingent income tax liabilities based on its assessment of probable income tax related exposures and the anticipated settlement of those exposures translating into actual future liabilities 
the contingent liabilities are estimated based on both historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities and the company s interpretation of current income tax related trends 
if the company s income tax contingent liability estimates prove to be inaccurate  the resulting adjustments could be material to the company s future financial results 
contingent liabilities legal matters 
the company is subject to legal  regulatory and other proceedings and claims 
reserves  if any  are established for these claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and to fairly present  in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in the company s financial statements and sec filings  management s view of the company s exposure 
the company reviews outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
these assessments are re evaluated each quarter or as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
lease accounting 
the majority of the company s stores are subject to short term leases usually with initial or primary terms of three to five years with multiple renewal options when available 
the company also has stores subject to build to suit arrangements with landlords  which typically carry a primary lease term of between and years with multiple renewal options 
approximately half of the company s stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume 
the company recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets are considered probable 
rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease 
the company records minimum rental expense on a straight line basis over the base  non cancelable lease term commencing on the date that the company takes physical possession of the property from the landlord  which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures 
when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent  the company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent 
the company also receives tenant allowances  which are recorded in deferred incentive rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
any difference between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid are reflected as a liability 
improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets 
when indicators of impairment are present  the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets 
the company may adjust the net book value of the underlying assets based upon such cash flow analysis compared to the book value and may also consider appraised values 
assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value 
the company also records impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores assets as deemed necessary due to negative sales trends and cash flows 
effects of inflation the company believes that inflation and or deflation had a minimal impact on its overall operations during  and accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which will require an entity to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including grants of employee stock options at fair value 
the company will adopt sfas no 
r during the first quarter of and expects to apply the standard using the modified prospective method  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for new and modified awards and also for unvested portions of previously issued and outstanding awards 
the company expects to incur incremental selling  general and administrative expense associated with the adoption of approximately million in  dependent upon the number of grants and their related fair market values 
see note to the c onsolidated financial statements for disclosure of the pro forma effects of stock option grants as determined using the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
on january   the compensation committee committee of the company s board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting for million of the company s outstanding stock options awarded prior to august  this acceleration was effective on february  vesting was not accelerated for stock options held by the ceo and stock options granted in to the officers of the company at the level of executive vice president or higher 
in addition  pursuant to that committee action  the vesting of all outstanding options granted on or after august  but prior to january   other than options granted during that time period to the officers of the company at the level of executive vice president or higher  accelerated effective as of the date that is six months after the applicable grant date 
certain options granted on ja nuary  to certain newly hired officers below the level of executive vice president were granted with a six month vesting period 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of stock options was made primarily to reduce non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following the adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal year this action is expected to enable the company to eliminate approximately million of expense  before income taxes  over the four year period during which the stock options would have vested  subject to the impact of additional adjustments related to the forfeiture of certain stock options 
the company also believes this decision benefits employees 
in connection with the acceleration and in accordance with the provisions of apb  the company recorded compensation expense of million  before income taxes  during in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entit y is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted the provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of  and this adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as a whole 
non gaap disclosures the company has included in this document free cash flow generated in and free cash flow is a measure not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company believes that this information is useful to investors as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company s operations 
it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant non cash component to the company s net income 
this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap 
management may use this information to better understand the company s underlying operating results 
a reconciliation of the company s calculation of free cash flow to the most comparable measure derived in accordance with gaap is set forth below 
for the years ended in thousands february  january  january  weeks weeks weeks net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents a less issuance of long term borrowings plus repurchases of common stock free cash flow a equal to the sum of net cash flows from operating activities  net cash flows from investing activities and net cash flows from financing activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates 
to minimize such risk  the company may periodically use financial instruments  including derivatives 
as a matter of policy  the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the board of directors 
all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 
the financial instruments used by the company are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit and tax increment financing  and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives in or at february  and january   the fair value of the company s debt  excluding capital lease obligations  was approximately million and million  respectively net of the fair value of a note receivable on the south boston  virginia dc of approximately million and million  respectively  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  based upon the estimated market value of the debt at those dates 
such fair value exceeded the carrying values of the debt at february  and january  by approximately million and million  respectively 
based upon the company s variable rate borrowing levels  a adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a pre tax reduction of earnings and cash flows on an annualized basis of approximately million in and less than million in in  the company had no outstanding variable rate borrowings 
based upon the company s outstanding indebtedness at february  and january   a reduction in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively
