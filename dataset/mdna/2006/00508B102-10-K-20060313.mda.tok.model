overview we are a leading provider of an enterprise reporting application platform  a unified software platform that enables large organizations and packaged application software vendors to develop and deploy self service  customer and employee facing enterprise reporting applications 
enterprise reporting applications are intuitive  web portal like reporting applications that empower of users with decision making information 
our actuate product line provides a platform upon which global organizations companies with annual revenues greater than billion and packaged application software vendors develop and deploy mission critical enterprise reporting applications 
these applications retrieve business information from corporate databases and deliver it as interactive web pages  excel spreadsheets  and analytic cubes to customers  partners and employees around the globe 
our products and services are used by our customers to develop and deploy enterprise reporting applications across a range of business functions including financial management  sales management  account management  and customer self service 
we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our software products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
our total revenues for fiscal year were million  which were slightly higher than our prior fiscal year revenues of million 
license revenues decreased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year the decrease in license revenues was more than offset by growth in services revenues  which grew approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year this growth was primarily due to increases in maintenance pricing and the installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
for fiscal year  net income was million or per diluted share compared with net income of million or per share in fiscal year the improvement in profitability was primarily due to lower expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year from fiscal year to fiscal year  total costs and expenses decreased by million 
the main factor contributing to this decrease was our restructuring in the fourth quarter of this restructuring resulted in higher charges in fiscal year  and lower expenses in as a result of lower headcount 
in fiscal year  provision for income taxes was million compared to million in fiscal year north american total revenues decreased by approximately  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  while revenues from our international regions increased from 
table of contents million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year to date  we have sold our products internationally primarily through our subsidiaries in europe and asia pacific 
during fiscal year  we derived of our total revenues from sales outside of north america while of our total revenues were derived from sales outside north america in fiscal year during fiscal year  three trends continued to have significant impact on results of our operations 
first  as an enterprise software vendor  we experienced a weak corporate spending environment for enterprise reporting applications 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly in second  we continued to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence and enterprise reporting software purchases into fewer suppliers 
corporations were reluctant to buy software from new vendors 
this impacted our ability to acquire as many new global customers as planned 
finally  we continued to experience vigorous competition in the enterprise reporting market 
the existence of this competitive environment required additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which resulted in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the enterprise reporting market will continue to be vigorous in during  we announced four strategic initiatives to help improve the sale of our software products in the future 
these initiatives are as follows selling to it management we intend to re focus our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
solution selling to line of business management we are creating software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these solutions are in the areas of financial management and customer self service reporting 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
investing in the business intelligence reporting tool birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in creating a new open source code reporting tool  known as birt 
we hope that birt will eventually become widely adopted by java developers and will create demand for our other commercially available products 
the birt project is a long term initiative 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we intend to continue focusing on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
during we continued to pursue these initiatives started in and we will continue to do so in we have added the following strategic initiative resulting from our acquisition of performancesoft delivering a highly differentiated performance management offering we intend to combine performancesoft s leading performance management applications and actuate s enterprise reporting application platform to provide capabilities for distributing accountability throughout the enterprise 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short to medium term 
as of december   we had full time employees  a net increase of employees  or  in our workforce reported as of december  we expect our headcount to grow considerably in with the inclusion of the personnel from performancesoft  which was acquired in january in the first quarter of we recognized  in severance  benefit and related legal costs when we initiated a restructuring of our international sales operation to size the operation to meet the expected business and economic environment for our products in overseas markets 
this restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction of five people 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a second restructuring program 
this was to further align our cost structure with future revenue expectations 
the restructuring plan reduced our operating 
table of contents expenses considerably in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
therefore  only a portion of the costs associated with this restructuring were reflected in our results of operations for the fourth quarter of the total amount of these costs expensed during the fourth quarter of was approximately million 
under this restructuring program  we recognized additional restructuring expenses of approximately  in fiscal year these costs were related to the restructuring of our international sales operation and primarily consisted of charges related to employee matters  estimated settlement costs stemming from employee litigation and idle facilities 
according to sfas  in order to record the costs related to an idle facility  we must first cease use of the facility 
we ceased use of this facility in the first quarter of fiscal year we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult and unreliable 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  restructuring  and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses and related services 
we receive software license revenues from licensing our products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oems 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that we perform for customers 
we recognize revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
for sales to end user customers  we recognize license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties or a definitive purchase order has been received from the customer  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for license fees 
therefore  we recognize revenues from arrangements with multiple elements involving software licenses under the residual method 
if the license agreement contains payment terms that would indicate that the fee is not fixed or determinable  such as extended payments due beyond the company s normal practice  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

table of contents we enter into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically give such distributors and resellers the right to distribute our products to end users headquartered in specified territories 
we recognize license revenues from arrangements with us resellers and distributors when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the reseller or distributor  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable and collectiblity is probable 
we recognize license fee revenues from arrangements with international resellers and distributors upon receipt of evidence of sell through and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if it is not practical to obtain evidence of sell through  we defer revenues until the end user has been identified and cash has been received 
in some instances there is a timing difference between when our reseller completes its sale to the end user and the period in which we receive the documentation required for revenue recognition 
because we delay revenue recognition until the required documentation is obtained  we may recognize revenue in a period subsequent to the period in which the reseller completes the sale to its end user 
we also enter into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on the bundling or embedding of our products with the oems products 
these arrangements generally provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
we recognize license fee revenues from us oem arrangements when a license agreement has been signed by both parties  the product has been shipped  there are no unusual uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
for sales through international oems  we defer revenue until we receive a royalty report or other evidence of sell through from such oem assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as discussed above  there may be a timing difference between the period in which our oem completes the sale to its end user  and the period in which we recognize the revenue 
credit worthiness and collectibility for end users are assessed based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
we recognize maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and unspecified product updates  ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation and configuration and are typically charged on a time and materials basis 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at our headquarters and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both license and service elements  the license fee is recognized on delivery of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the product and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also specifically reserve for all outstanding domestic consulting  training  and maintenance renewal invoices which are older than a specified number of months past due 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 

table of contents income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the determination of net deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
based on all the available evidence we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet may not be realized 
as a result a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or reduce loss  reduce goodwill or intangibles or increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
due to the current economic environment  increased competition  a history of net losses  and our uncertainty in projecting future taxable income  we have determined that we can no longer rely on projections of future taxable income to support the realization of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has  therefore  been recorded in fiscal year to reduce deferred tax assets to zero  except for  of deferred tax assets recorded in the united kingdom 
contingencies 
we are or have been engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in litigation or settlement strategy for a particular matter 
accrual for restructuring charges 
during the fiscal years ended december  and  we implemented certain restructuring plans that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and write offs of fixed assets 
the restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with these restructuring plans 
these estimates were impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
in fiscal year  we recorded a facility restructuring charge  which consisted of estimated future obligations for the non cancelable lease payments and estimated costs associated with subleasing the property 
we reduced the amount of the facility restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we made  which we periodically re evaluate and adjust as appropriate  are based on estimates of such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublease the property and sublease rates 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for exiting the idle facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to 
table of contents restructuring charges 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional restructuring charge would be recorded and would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  customer lists  non compete agreements  experienced workforce  and trademarks 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if the assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
as of december  the net carrying amount of our intangible assets was million 
we evaluate goodwill at least annually for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
valuation of minority interest in actuate japan 
the minority shareholders of actuate japan have the option to put their equity interest minority interest in actuate japan and we have the option to call the minority interest for approximately  as of december  our policy is to record a loss  if any  at the time that the put or call is probable of being exercised 
should an indicator arise that the minority interest has declined in value below the exercise price of the put and call option  we would conclude that exercise is probable at that point in time and recognize a liability for the intrinsic value of the option 
we periodically perform a valuation analysis of the minority interest 
this valuation analysis includes assumptions regarding projected future cash flows and discount rates 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether a loss is probable and the amount of the loss 
as of december   we concluded that a loss was not probable 
we consolidate of the operating results and all investments in the subsidiary are eliminated in consolidation 
recovery of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recovery of its long lived assets periodically by analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment

the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a or approximately million increase in our maintenance revenue due to the impact of an aggressive support renewal pricing structure implemented in fiscal year and a continued increase in the worldwide installed base of customers receiving ongoing support 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately or million in our license and or  in our consulting services revenues 
we believe these decreases were primarily due to increased competition from other vendors in our market as well as several unusually large license deals signed in fiscal year the slight increase in total revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase of approximately in support and maintenance revenue due to continued increase in worldwide installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support  offset by decreases of approximately or million in license and or  in consulting services revenues 
we believe these decreases were due primarily to increased competition from other vendors in our market 

table of contents license fees year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands the decrease in license revenue  in both percentage and absolute dollar terms for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily seen in our north american region and was primarily due to several interrelated factors  including i a continued depressed information technology spending environment for enterprise reporting solutions  ii difficulty in securing new customer accounts  iii continued competitive pressures  and iv fewer significant transactions  each individually in excess of million  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the following table represents the changes in license revenue by region dollars in thousands year ended december  to to software license change change change change north america international total license revenue percentage of total revenue the european region marked the highest growth in license revenue during fiscal year this was due mainly to a significant agreement with a financial institution during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the decreases in license revenues in north america over fiscal were primarily due to less large deals in excess of million in fiscal year in addition  the competitive environment in our market niche continues to contribute to the decrease in domestic license revenues in fiscal over year 
license revenues derived from our indirect channel partners  including oems  systems integrators and resellers  accounted for  and of total revenues from license fees for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect license fees to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year primarily as a result of our recent acquisition of performancesoft  inc  which occurred in january maintenance and service revenue maintenance and services revenue comprised of maintenance and support  professional services  and training 
the steady increase in maintenance revenue from fiscal year to was mainly attributed to the impact of the company s change in pricing structure of maintenance renewals introduced in fiscal year  as well as a larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance and support 
also in fiscal year  the company benefited from a concerted effort to increase maintenance renewals 
in contrast to prior years  in order to increase maintenance renewals  the company hired additional employees to head the effort of ensuring customers renew their maintenance agreements once the original maintenance contracts expire 
this effort was undertaken during the second quarter of fiscal and resulted in continued increase of maintenance and support revenue in both fiscal years and in fiscal our professional services revenues remained relatively consistent in all geographical regions with the levels experienced in fiscal we expect maintenance and services revenue to increase in fiscal year in absolute dollars as our installed base of customers under maintenance continues to grow and as a result of our acquisition of performancesoft  inc 
in january 
table of contents costs and expenses cost of license fees year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands cost of license fees consists primarily of production costs including printing and packaging  amortization of purchased technologies  third party royalty fees and localization costs 
the decrease in cost of license fees in fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in software license revenues resulting in approximately  reductions in third party royalties and  in production costs 
third party royalties further decreased due to the fact that we are no longer obligated to pay royalties to one of our main vendors as we acquired the rights to the underlying technology outright in the fourth quarter of fiscal year there was also a reduction of approximately  in the amortization of purchased technologies 
purchased technologies related to the tidestone acquisition became fully amortized in the second quarter of fiscal and accounted for approximately  of the decrease 
the increase in cost of license fees in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a full year amortization of purchased technology as a result of our acquisition of nimble technology in fiscal year resulting in a net increase of  increased third party royalties of  offset by a  decrease in localization costs 
we expect our cost of license fees as a percentage of revenues from license fees to gradually increase in future periods primarily as a result of the straight line amortization of purchased technology associated with the acquisition of performancesoft  inc 
in january of cost of services year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands cost of services consists primarily of personnel and related costs  facilities costs incurred in providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
the decrease in cost of services in absolute dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily a result of the decrease in employee compensation and related costs of million due to an reduction to our services headcount or approximately heads and reduced facilities cost of approximately  these decreases were offset by increased third party consulting costs of approximately million 
our increase in maintenance and support revenues  combined with a reduction to the overall cost of services  resulted in improved services margins of approximately over fiscal year the increase in cost of services in absolute dollars in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily a result of the increase in service revenue during the year 
although service revenue in absolute dollars increased by million over fiscal year  cost of services as a percentage of services revenues decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this decrease is due to the fact that the primary driver in the service revenue increase was derived from maintenance and support  which have considerably lower costs associated with them than consulting services 
we expect cost of services to increase in fiscal year in line with the anticipated increase in service revenues associated with our acquisition of performancesoft  inc 
in january 
table of contents sales and marketing year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to a million reduction in compensation and associated expenses and a million reduction of facilities and equipment charges 
this decrease was mainly the result of our restructuring plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year which resulted in a significant reduction to our international sales operations 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to a reduction of million in marketing program expenses and a reduction of million in professional and outside consulting services  both as a result of the company s efforts in fiscal year to focus on reducing overall marketing expenditures 
sales and marketing expenses also decreased in fiscal year partially as a result of the restructuring in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a decrease in headcount as compared to at the end of fiscal year  we had employees in sales and marketing  compared with and employees at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
we currently expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year primarily due to our recent acquisition of performancesoft  inc 
in january of research and development year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
the decrease in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily attributed to the consolidation of our research and development facilities which resulted in the closure of our office in seattle  washington 
this closure occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and resulted in compensation  travel and facilities related savings of approximately million in the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to costs associated with the opening of our shanghai research facility totaling approximately  at the end of fiscal year  we had employees in research and development compared to and employees at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
we believe that continued investments in technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year due to our recent acquisition of performancesoft  inc 
in january of general and administrative year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs in finance  human resources  legal and tax functions  as well as audit and legal fees and bad debt expense 
the increase in expenses 
table of contents in fiscal year in absolute dollars was primarily due to a continued increase in professional consulting fees of approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to costs incurred in early related to the company s compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act for fiscal year we also experienced an increase of approximately  due primarily to a full year of depreciation and capitalized costs related to the implementation of our new accounting system  which was activated in august of fiscal year employee compensation and related costs also increased by approximately  due to the addition of heads or a increase in headcount 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of million in legal costs associated with the microstrategy litigation  which ended favorably in fiscal year we also recorded a reversal of sales taxes of  in the second quarter of fiscal year due to a favorable outcome on our board of equalization audit 
in addition  we negotiated a more favorable property and liability insurance premium  which lowered the expense by approximately  in fiscal year these decreases were offset by increases in professional consulting fees and internal personnel costs of approximately million in fiscal year as a result of the company s compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for fiscal year this overall increase will be primarily due to the addition of performancesoft  inc 
in the first quarter of this overall increase will partially be offset by a decrease in professional fees associated with maintaining compliance under the sarbanes oxley act 
amortization of other intangibles year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets safs  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective january  the provisions of sfas require an impairment test at least annually  which we completed on october   october  and october  none of these annual impairment tests resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill 
the decreases in amortization of other purchased intangibles in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to the fact that we fully amortized the other intangibles associated with our acquisitions of tidestone and nimble technology by the second and third quarter of fiscal year  respectively 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we offset approximately  of accrued liabilities from our purchase of nimble technology against purchased technologies as the contingencies that gave rise to the original accrued liability amounts were settled for an amount lower than originally estimated 
as there was no goodwill associated with the nimble acquisition  the reduction of accrued liabilities resulted in a decrease to unamortized purchased technologies during the second quarter of fiscal year the net decrease in amortization of other purchased intangible assets in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the customer base related to prior acquisitions in europe that were fully amortized by the middle of fiscal year this resulted in a decrease of approximately million offset by an increase in the amortization of purchased technology and workforce of  related to the acquisition of nimble technology 
we expect the estimated amortization expense of our existing other purchased intangible assets to increase in future periods due to our acquisition of performancesoft  inc 
in january of fiscal year 
table of contents restructuring charges year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands    n a the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this form k 
during fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of a million facility exit charge and million in costs related to the reduction of our worldwide workforce 
the facility exit charge was the result of a long term non cancelable lease agreement that we entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in anticipation of a projected business expansion 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we decided to exit this facility 
we review our assumptions underlying the idle facilities reserve on a regular basis 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the sublease was extended with the existing tenant 
as a result of this extension  some of the assumptions that were previously asserted changed and  accordingly  we revised and lowered the estimated exit costs by approximately  during fiscal year  the company underwent two restructurings 
the first occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year when we initiated a restructuring of our international sales operation 
we undertook this restructuring in order to size the operation to meet the expected business and economic environment for our products in international markets and to shift our sales strategy from one based primarily on direct sales to a strategy more focused on indirect sales channels 
this restructuring consisted primarily of a workforce reduction and associated legal expenses  which resulted in a headcount reduction of five people and associated severance  benefit and related legal costs of  during the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a second restructuring program 
this was to further align our cost structure with future revenue expectations 
under this restructuring program  we recognized restructuring expenses of approximately million in the fourth quarter of and approximately  in fiscal year these costs were entirely related to the restructuring of our international sales operation and primarily consisted of charges related to employee matters  estimated settlement costs stemming from employee litigation and idle facilities charges 
these costs were partially offset by reductions in an office lease loss accrual due to an early termination of the facility lease 
according to financial accounting standards statement no 
sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in order to record the costs related to an idle facility  we must first cease use of the facility 
we ceased use of this facility in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently in the process of evaluating whether to consolidate any of our facilities as a result of the performancesoft acquisition 
if we were to consolidate any of our facilities in fiscal year it could result in a facility related restructuring charge 

table of contents the following table summarizes the analysis of the restructuring accrual activity for the fiscal years ended december   and in thousands severance benefits facility related total balance at december  cash payments changes in estimate rents collected on the sublease balance at december  restructuring charges cash payments changes in estimate rents collected on the sublease balance at december  restructuring charges cash payments changes in estimate rents collected on the sublease less current portion balance at december  interest and other income  net year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands interest and other income  net  are comprised primarily of interest income earned by us on our cash and short term investments 
the increase for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to improved returns on our cash and investments of  and currency exchange gains totaling  these increases were offset by a realized investment loss of  which we incurred in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  a one time grant of  received in the prior year and adjustments of approximately  in personnel and social taxes by our international subsidiaries 
the realized investment loss was associated with our investment in a company that we evaluated during the second quarter of fiscal year we determined the value to be other than temporarily impaired and  accordingly  reduced the book value from  to approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  this company was acquired and we received approximately  in cash 
the remaining balance of approximately  has not yet been received by actuate  as it is pending final settlement 
the increase in interest and other income  net  in fiscal year from was primarily due to improved returns on our cash and investments totaling approximately  and other gains totaling  related to currency exchange transactions with our international subsidiaries

a valuation allowance has  therefore  been recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to zero except for  of deferred tax assets recorded in the united kingdom 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or reduce loss  reduce goodwill or intangibles or increase shareholder s equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
due to the current economic environment  increased competition  a history of net losses  and our uncertainty in projecting future taxable income  we have determined that we can no longer rely on projections of future taxable income to support the realization of our deferred tax assets

we will continue to assess our ability to realize the tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted results

 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  sfas does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements

we are in the process of evaluating the approximate impact of sfas no 
r for fiscal  however  we expect the impact to be material

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during the fiscal years and we derived and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on these receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our gains due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately  in fiscal year compared to losses of approximately  during fiscal year interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the general level of us interest rates we invest in short term securities that have an average maturity of one year or less 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified by geography and no single customer has accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue on an annual basis 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
