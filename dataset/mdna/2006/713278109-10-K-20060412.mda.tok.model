item a risk factors our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to pep boys if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations  our liquidity will suffer and we may be unable to satisfy our obligations 
we require significant capital to fund our business 
while we believe we have the ability to sufficiently fund our planned operations and capital expenditures for the balance of fiscal year  circumstances could arise that would materially affect our liquidity 
for example  cash flows from our operations could be affected by changes in consumer spending habits or the failure to maintain favorable vendor payment terms or our inability to successfully implement sales growth initiatives 
we may be unsuccessful in securing alternative financing when needed  on terms that we consider acceptable  or at all 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to your investment in our securities  including the following risks our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  our failure to comply with financial and operating restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries by our credit facilities could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business or our prospects  and if we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  we might be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of these relationships or of our vendors operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our business depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with our vendors 
many factors outside our control may harm these relationships 
for example  financial difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them 
in addition  our failure to promptly pay  or order sufficient quantities of inventory from our vendors may increase the cost of products we purchase or may lead to vendors refusing to sell products to us at all 
the recent trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may also disrupt our relationships with some vendors 
a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend on our senior management team and our other personnel  and we face substantial competition for qualified personnel 
our success depends in part on the efforts of our senior management team 
our continued success will also depend upon our ability to retain existing  and attract additional  qualified field personnel to meet our needs 
we face substantial competition  both from within and outside of the automotive aftermarket to retain and attract qualified personnel 
in addition  we believe that the number of qualified automotive service technicians in the industry is generally insufficient to meet demand 
we face possible adverse changes in tax laws 
from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted  which may increase our tax liability 
the shortfalls in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years have led and may continue to lead to an increase in the frequency and scope of such changes and to increases in the number of tax audits initiated by such jurisdictions  particularly with respect to large and well known retailers 
we also face the risk that tax authorities may challenge certain aspects of our acquisition  operation or disposition of properties 
if such challenges are successful  we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income and may be assessed interest and penalties on such additional taxes 
these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make interest payments to holders of the notes 
we are subject to environmental laws and may be subject to environmental liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products we sell and use in our service bays  the recycling of batteries  tires and used lubricants  and the ownership and operation of real property 
as a result of investigations undertaken in connection with a number of our store acquisitions and financings  we are aware that soil or groundwater may be contaminated at some of our properties 
any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
risks related to our industry our industry is highly competitive  and price competition in some categories of the automotive aftermarket or a loss of trust in our participation in the do it for me market  could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings 
the automotive aftermarket retail and service industry is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors 
we compete primarily with the following types of businesses in each category of the automotive aftermarket do it yourself retail automotive parts and accessories stores  automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories  and mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and select non automotive merchandise that appeals to automotive do it yourself customers  such as generators  power tools and canopies 
do it for me service labor regional and local full service automotive repair shops  automobile dealers that provide repair and maintenance services  national and regional including franchised tire retailers that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services  and national and regional including franchised specialized automotive such as exhaust  brake and transmission repair facilities that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services 
installed merchandise commercial mass merchandisers  wholesalers and jobbers some of which are associated with national parts distributors or associations 
tire sales national and regional including franchised tire retailers  and mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell tires 
a number of our competitors have more financial resources  are more geographically diverse or have better name recognition than we do  which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors 
because we seek to offer competitive prices  if our competitors reduce their prices we may also be forced to reduce our prices  which could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings and hinder our ability to service our debt 
with respect to the service labor category  the majority of consumers are unfamiliar with their vehicle s mechanical operation and  as a result  often select a service provider based on trust 
potential occurrences of negative publicity associated with the pep boys brand  the products we sell or installation or repairs performed in our service bays  whether or not factually accurate  could cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services in the short or long term  and cause them to choose our competitors for their automotive service needs 
vehicle miles driven may decrease  resulting in a decline of our revenues and negatively affecting our results of operations 
our industry depends on the number of vehicle miles driven 
factors that may cause the number of vehicle miles and our revenues and our results of operations to decrease include the weather as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather  the economy as during periods of poor economic conditions  customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  and during periods of good economic conditions  consumers may opt to purchase new vehicles rather than service the vehicles they currently own and replace worn or damaged parts  gas prices as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles  and travel patterns as changes in travel patterns may cause consumers to rely more heavily on train and airplane transportation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview introduction pep boys is a leader in the automotive aftermarket  with stores and more than  service bays located throughout states and puerto rico 
all of our stores feature the nationally recognized pep boys brand name  established through more than years of providing high quality automotive merchandise and services  and are company owned  ensuring chain wide consistency for our customers 
we are the only national chain offering automotive service  accessories  tires and parts under one roof  positioning us to achieve our goal of becoming the category dominant one stop shop for automotive maintenance and accessories 
of our stores  are what we refer to as supercenters  which feature an average of state of the art service bays  with an average of more than  square feet per supercenter 
our store size allows us to display and sell a more complete offering of merchandise in a wider array of categories than our competitors  with a focus on the high growth accessories segment and a comprehensive tire offering 
we leverage this investment in inventory through our ability to install what we sell in our service bays and by offering this merchandise to both commercial and retail customers 
we had total revenues of  and an operating loss of  in fiscal for the fifty two weeks ended january  our comparative sales decreased by compared to increases of and for the fifty two weeks ended january  and january   respectively 
this decrease in comparable sales was due primarily to a decrease in comparable service revenue 
comparable sales were negatively impacted by disruptions in our stores  resulting from our recent initiatives designed to improve our long term performance  such as our store refurbishment program  a field reorganization into separate retail and service teams and human resources recruiting and training initiatives  and in the economy  resulting from higher gasoline prices which decreased both our customers disposable income and the amount of miles driven 
all stores that are included in the comparable store sales base as of the end of the period are included in the company s comparable store data calculations 
upon reaching its th month of operation  a store is added to our comparable store sales base 
stores are removed from the comparable store sales base upon their relocation or closure 
once a relocated store reaches its th month of operation at its new location  it is added back into our comparable store sales base 
square footage increases are infrequent and immaterial and  accordingly  are not considered in our calculations of comparable store data 
during we increased our total debt by  due to operating losses  investments in inventory  our ongoing store refurbishment program  repurchases of common equity and costs to refinance company indebtedness 
in addition  we refinanced  of debt and associated costs  which had maturity dates in and the above increases in debt and maturities were financed through the issuance of a  senior secured term loan and our existing credit facility 
since  we have paid a quarterly cash dividend on an uninterrupted basis  and we are currently paying a dividend at an annualized rate of per share 
during we reinvested in our existing stores to redesign their interiors and enhance their exterior appeal 
our new interior design features four distinct merchandising worlds accessories fashion  electronic and performance merchandise  maintenance hard parts and chemicals  garage repair shop and travel and service including tire  wheel and accessory installation 
we believe that this layout provides customers with a clear and concise way of finding what they need and will promote cross selling 
in most of our stores  we have moved our service desks and waiting areas inside the retail stores adjacent to our tire offering displays 
modifications to the exterior of our stores are designed to increase customer traffic 
during we grand reopened stores in the following markets los angeles  ca first quarter  chicago  il  and philadelphia  pa second quarter  harrisburg  pa third quarter  las vegas  nv  phoenix  az and tucson  az fourth quarter 
over the next three fiscal years we expect to remodel and grand reopen approximately more stores  as follows stores in fiscal  stores in fiscal  and the balance in fiscal on the first day of fiscal  the company separated its field organization into separate retail and service organizations 
the restructuring  which allows the company to hire management employees with industry specific experience in retail or service  is designed to sharpen the focus on each side of the business thereby improving overall profitability 
business strategy our strategy to become the category dominant one stop shop for automotive maintenance and accessories includes improving our merchandising capabilities 
we will continue to merchandise our stores with a new and flexible product mix designed to increase customer purchases 
we will take advantage of our industry leading average retail square footage to increase the appeal of our merchandise displays 
we utilize product specific advertising to highlight promotional items and pricing  primarily through weekly print advertising 
enhancing our stores 
we are investing in our existing stores to redesign our interiors and enhance their exterior appeal 
we believe that this layout will provide customers with a clear and concise way of finding what they need and will promote cross selling 
improving service center performance 
we are working to improve the financial performance of our service center operations by improving tire sales and related attachment sales  and improving labor productivity 
to improve tire sales  we have reduced our advertised opening price points  while offering attractive opportunities for customers to upgrade to tires with better warranties  features  or brands 
in addition  we have emphasized training our staff to offer beneficial services related to each tire sale such as wheel balancing  alignments and warranties  as well as to provide a thorough safety check that highlights any further car maintenance or repair needs 
in  we changed the organization of our field supervision team to focus the supervision of service and tires sales activities 
we also increased turnover of poorly performing service managers 
these activities were disruptive  as many of our service managers and other supervisory positions were new to the company in  but we believe the skills and background of these associates will aid performance in future years 
in addition  as we worked to build the capabilities of our service personnel  we maintained their staffing levels despite lower service and tires sales volumes 
in  we intend to more closely tailor our labor costs to labor sales volumes providing an opportunity to improve labor productivity going forward 
improve store productivity 
we expect to focus on improving the returns of our investment in store assets through managing our store portfolio  and taking advantage of opportunities for store relocations  disposals or new store additions 
any net store growth will focus primarily upon increasing penetration in our existing markets to further leverage our investments 
the format of these new stores is likely to include both supercenters and a service only format that will utilize existing supercenters for most of their inventory needs 
the following discussion explains the material changes in our results of operations for the fifty two weeks ended january   january   and january  capital liquidity capital resources and needs in fiscal  as a result of lower operating profitability  capital expenditures for our store redesign and refurbishment program  an increase in inventory and share repurchases  we increased our debt by  and decreased our cash and cash equivalents by  for fiscal  we plan to open or relocate fewer than five stores and to refurbish stores  as compared to grand reopenings in fiscal the completion of the refurbishment program is expected in fiscal our capital expenditure program for fiscal is expected to be less than anticipated depreciation and amortization of  and inventory levels in should be similar to those of we anticipate that improved cash provided from operations  our existing line of credit  cash on hand and future access to capital markets will exceed our expected cash requirements in fiscal and in fiscal  merchandise inventories increased as the company continued initiatives begun in fiscal designed to feature new  complementary product lines
