item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview our business is comprised of developing and licensing business process management bpm software to our customers  and providing professional services  maintenance and training to those customers to maximize the business value from using our software 
we focus our sales efforts on target accounts  which are companies or divisions within companies  and are typically large organizations that are among the leaders in their industry 
we frequently sell limited size initial licenses to these target accounts rather than selling large application licenses 
this allows our customers to quickly realize business value from our software and limits their up front investment 
once a customer has realized this initial value  we work with the customer to identify opportunities for follow on sales 
follow on sales are often larger than the initial sale  and the sales process for follow on sales is often shorter as a result of the established relationship with the customer 
our customers typically request professional services and training to assist them in implementing our products 
our customers also purchase maintenance on our products in almost all situations  which is typically for annually renewable terms  and includes rights to upgrades and new releases  incident resolution and technical assistance 
we provide maintenance and training services directly to most of our customers 
professional services are provided directly by us in some situations and through our network of partners in other cases 
the amount of professional services provided by our partners has been increasing in recent years 
by utilizing these partners  we have significantly increased the supply of skilled service consultants that can assist our customers 
in certain situations  our partners are also able to offer lower rates to our customers due to the use of resources located in other countries  thereby reducing the overall cost 
some of our partners have more headcount dedicated to consulting services for our products than we have 
we believe that this trend is good for our business because of the breadth of domain expertise that our partners can bring to solutions 
we expect that our services revenue may grow more slowly over time than if we did not rely on our partners 
the percentage of our license revenue from our pegarules process commander software and related solution frameworks has been increasing 
these products often require less implementation assistance than prior generations of our software products 
in many cases this has enabled us to shorten the length of the sales process and the time required to receive customer acceptance of the software product 
significantly  pegarules process commander and solution frameworks can be used more broadly by customers within our traditional financial services and healthcare markets  as well as by customers outside of our traditional markets  enabling us to sell to expanded markets 
in recent years  we have typically licensed our software to new customers pursuant to perpetual licenses  under which a customer pays a single license fee at the commencement of the license  rather than term licenses 
under term licenses a customer pays a monthly fee during the license term and must renew the license for additional fees to continue to use the software after the original term 
we expect that perpetual licenses for new customers will continue to be a significant portion of total license signings  although we expect to enter into new term licenses in certain instances 
our use of perpetual licenses rather than term licenses has the effect  with respect to a given transaction  of increasing our license revenue and cash flow in the short term  but of decreasing the amount of renewal revenue and cash flow in the future 
generally  in prior periods  we have recognized the present value of committed future term license payments upon customer acceptance at the beginning of the license term 
in the future  we expect to increasingly enter into term licenses with contract provisions that require the term license revenue to be recognized over the term of the agreement as payments become due  or ratably over the term of the license when payments are made in advance 
this would have the effect  with respect to a particular agreement  of reducing our term license revenue in the initial period but increasing the amount of recurring future term license revenue during the remainder of the license term  but would not change the expected cash flow 

table of contents overview of results of operations while the value of license signings in was only modestly higher than the value of license signings in  license signings during the second half of improved significantly from the value of license signings in the first half of the increase in the value of license signings for the second half of was due to the increased success of our strategy of focusing on initial and follow on sales to target accounts 
actual license signings are likely to fluctuate considerably quarter to quarter 
total revenue in increased to million from million in driven primarily by a million increase in maintenance revenue 
professional services and training revenue increased million and license revenue decreased million 
the million increase in maintenance revenue resulted from an expanded installed base of software and a higher proportion of perpetual licenses in the installed base  which yield greater maintenance revenue than term licenses 
increased professional services costs during reduced our service gross margin from in to in the increase in these costs reflects an investment in expanding the number of trained services personnel  including new pegasystems and partner staff  to better meet the anticipated increase in our new license signings 
income before provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a million decrease in services gross margin  a million increase in operating expenses  a million unfavorable change in other income and expense related to foreign currency transactions  and a million decrease in license margin  partially offset by a million improvement in interest income 
net income for decreased to million from million in  due to the decrease in income before provision for income taxes partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in we generated million in cash flow from operations during  and ended the period with million in cash and short term investments and million in combined short and long term license installment receivables 
consistent with our strategy of working with accounts in target customer organizations to identify opportunities for follow on sales  a majority of our revenue in was from existing customers who chose to add on to  renew or extend their use of our software 
however  new customers meaning companies or organizational divisions which are not current licensees of our software accounted for million  or  of total revenue 

table of contents statement of income information the following shows certain items reflected in our statement of income as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  software license revenue services revenue total revenue cost of software license cost of services total cost of revenue gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations installment receivable interest income other interest income  net other income expense  net income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income international revenues international revenue was  and of total consolidated revenue in  and  respectively 
our international revenue may fluctuate in the future because such revenue is generally dependent upon a small number of sales and product acceptances by our customers during a given period 
historically  most of our contracts have been denominated in us dollars 
we expect  however  that in the future more of our contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies which may expose us to increased currency exchange risk

the total license revenue amount has not changed from prior presentation 
total license revenue for decreased to million from million in the decrease in total license revenue was the result of a million decrease in perpetual licenses partially offset by a million increase in term licenses 
the increase in term license revenue primarily reflected one large new term license transaction with an existing customer in the third quarter of the decrease in perpetual license revenue reflected our strategy of selling smaller initial perpetual licenses to our target accounts  with the potential of larger follow on sales 
term license renewals scheduled for are modestly higher than actual term license renewals in while historically a majority of customers have renewed their term licenses  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
maintenance revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in maintenance revenue for was due to a larger installed base of software and a higher proportion of perpetual licenses in the installed base which yield greater maintenance revenue than term licenses 
the million increase in professional services and training revenue in reflects an increased demand from our customers for these services  partially offset by the fact that benefited from million of revenue associated with the completion of two unusually large fixed price contracts 
typically  we derive substantial revenue from services provided in connection with the implementation of software licensed by new customers 
deferred revenue at december  consisted primarily of the fees billed in connection with arrangements for which acceptance of the software license or completion of fixed price services had not occurred  and unearned portions of annual maintenance fees paid in advance 
deferred revenue balances increased to million as of december   from million as of december  the million increase was due primarily to new license arrangements for which acceptance of the software or completion of fixed price services had not occurred and an increased value of unearned portions of annual maintenance fees paid in advance 
international revenue increased to of total revenue for from for this increase was primarily related to one large international license transaction in the third quarter of our international revenue may fluctuate in the future because such revenue is generally dependent upon a small number of license 
table of contents transactions during a given period 
we expect that due to competition from vendors who will do business in foreign currencies  more of our customer transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which may expose us to increased currency exchange risk 
cost of revenue the cost of maintenance  professional services and training increased to million from million in cost of services as a percentage of services revenue increased to for from for such increases were due primarily to a million increase in compensation costs  a million increase in contracted services and a million increase in travel costs 
these increases reflect an investment in expanding the pool of trained service personnel  including new professional services employees and partners to support an increase in the number of license implementation projects and in anticipation of increased demand resulting from new license signings 
services gross margin was million for compared to million for the decrease in services gross margin reflects the increase in services costs  partially offset by growth in maintenance revenue and its associated higher margin 
such decrease also reflects the fact that the first quarter of benefited from million of revenue and gross margin associated with two unusually large fixed price contracts completed during that period 
services headcount was at the end of compared to at the end of operating expenses research and development expenses for decreased to million from million for due to reduced use of contractors partially offset by costs associated with increased employee headcount 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to increased revenue 
research and development headcount at the end of was compared to at the end of selling and marketing expenses for increased to million from million for this increase was due to a million increase in sales commissions  an increase in marketing program spending of million  and increased wages and benefits expenses of million due to higher headcount

general and administrative headcount at the end of was compared to at the end of general and administrative expenses decreased in primarily due to reduced legal fees partially offset by costs associated with increased headcount 
installment receivable interest income installment receivable interest income  which consists of the portion of all term license fees under software license agreements attributable to the time value of money  decreased to million in from million for the decrease was due primarily to a lower total value of that portfolio 
a portion of the fee from each term license arrangement is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income over the remaining term of the license 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used are estimates of customers borrowing rates  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and during the past few years 
other interest income  net other interest income increased to million in from million for the increase was primarily due to increased cash and investment balances and improved yields 

table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net  which consists primarily of currency exchange gains and losses  was million expense in compared to million income in the unfavorable change in other expense  net  resulted primarily from the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions recorded on our us ledger valued in foreign currencies  consisting primarily of cash  investments  license installments  receivables  accounts payable and accruals 
in particular  changes in the exchange rates of european currencies have unfavorably impacted foreign currency denominated assets 
income before provision for income taxes income before provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in services gross margin  a million decrease in other income and expense related to foreign currency transactions  a million increase in operating expenses primarily due to investments in sales and marketing and a million decrease in license revenue  partially offset by a million improvement in other interest income  net 
provision for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes in was million compared to million in the effective tax rate was in compared to in during  we engaged outside tax experts to review certain significant tax positions previously taken by the company 
certain of these projects were completed during the third and fourth quarters of specifically  during the third quarter of  we completed a study of our deferred tax liabilities primarily related to term license installments  which resulted in an increase of our deferred tax liabilities 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we completed a study of our extra territorial income exclusions  which resulted in a decrease of our reserve for tax uncertainties related to this item 
as a result of these projects and other considerations  we reduced our valuation allowances by million  as we determined that a change in the estimates relating to utilization of credit carry forwards was necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net income tax benefit of million due primarily to changes in estimates upon completion of the study of benefits related to extra territorial income exclusions  recording of tax refunds and overpayments  and changes in deferred tax items 
these fourth quarter entries also significantly decreased the effective tax rate for compared to the statutory rate 
we expect the remaining tax projects to be completed during the first half of and any additional adjustments resulting from their completion will be recorded at that time 
our effective income tax rate for was below the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to a million reduction in our valuation allowances due to a change in estimate relating to utilization of credit carry forwards 
our effective tax rate was further reduced because we recorded million of benefits primarily related to tax refunds and overpayments  million of benefits related to current period extra territorial income exclusions  a million reduction in reserve for tax uncertainties related to extra territorial income exclusions  million of estimated federal research and experimentation credit  a million benefit from foreign activities  and million of net benefit from state income taxes primarily due to state income tax credits 
these factors were partially offset by a million increase to our deferred tax liabilities primarily related to term license installments  a increase in reserve for tax uncertainties related to tax credits  and million of permanent differences primarily related to non deductible meals and entertainment expenses 
the company has provided reserves for certain tax matters  both domestic and foreign  which it believes could result in additional tax being due 
any additional assessment or reduction of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in the company s effective tax rate in the period that additional facts become known 
the reserve for tax uncertainties totaled approximately million as of december  and judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties  transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries  and potential 
table of contents challenges to nexus and tax credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact  unfavorable or favorable  on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
the reserve for tax uncertainties totaled approximately million as of december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our total revenue for decreased to million from million in this decrease was due to a decline in license revenue  partially offset by an increase in services revenue

the total license revenue amount has not changed from prior presentation 
total license revenue for decreased to million from million for this decrease in total license revenue was the result of a million decrease in term license revenue  and an anticipated million decline in perpetual license revenue from first data resources fdr  partially offset by a million increase in other perpetual license revenue 
in  we originally entered into a term software license and support agreement with fdr  granting to fdr the right to use our software and new products and the exclusive right to market  distribute  and sublicense our software and new products to fdr customers and prospects in the credit card market 
the agreement was restructured in the first quarter of  to change the existing term license to a perpetual license without exclusive rights in the credit card market 
under the terms of the restructured fdr agreement  we recognized million of perpetual license revenue in we recognized no further license revenue from fdr in the million decrease in term license revenue in reflected a lower value of scheduled renewals in versus  as well as a reduction in term license add ons and extensions 
in addition  fewer customers renewed term licenses in advance of their scheduled renewal date during as compared to services revenue for increased to million from million for this increase was due primarily to an increase in new license implementations in  and higher customer maintenance revenue

research and development headcount at the end of was compared to at the end of selling and marketing expenses for increased to million from million for this increase was due to an increase in our sales personnel  and an increase in sales commissions associated with increased new license bookings  partially offset by a million decrease in marketing program spending 
marketing program spending decreased because we deemphasized broad based market awareness and advertising spending in favor of increased spending on sales hiring and sales activities

we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next twelve months 
material risks to cash flow from operations include delayed or reduced cash payments accompanying sales of new licenses or a decline in our services business 
there can be no assurance that changes in our plans or other events affecting our operations will not result in materially accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional capital if needed will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as we require 
as of december   we did not have material commitments for capital or operating expenditures other than a purchase commitment for customer support services and capital and operating leases 
the purchase commitment for customer support services covers quality assurance and engineering support for legacy software 
our principal administrative  sales  marketing  support  and research and development operations are located in an  square foot leased facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
the lease for this facility expires in  with the option to extend for two additional five year periods 
we also lease space for our other offices in the united states  canada  australia  france  and the united kingdom 
these leases expire at various dates through 
table of contents rent expense under operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis  to account for scheduled rent increases 
the excess of expense over current payments is recorded as deferred rent and included in other long term liabilities 
as of december   our known contractual obligations were as follows payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and after purchase commitments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total subsequent to year end  the company entered into a purchase commitment with a partner for contracted professional services at a cost of million per year for the next three years for a total commitment of million 
our liquidity is affected by the manner in which we collect cash for certain types of license transactions 
historically  our term licenses have provided for monthly license payments  generally over five years 
the value of future license payments is included on our balance sheet as short and long term license installments 
in some cases  we are beginning to recognize revenue under some of our term licenses over the term of the agreement as payments become due  or ratably over the term of the license when payments are made in advance 
the value of future license payments under these ratable term licenses is not included on our balance sheet 
the following amounts of cash are due for receipt in connection with our existing term license agreements years ending december  license installments for term licenses recorded on the balance sheet license installments for ratable term licenses not on balance sheet in thousands and thereafter total license installments on the balance sheet represent the present value of term license fees which have not yet been billed  and have already been recognized as revenue 
license installments at december  decreased million from december   primarily because license fees billed during exceeded term license revenue recognized  with million of the decrease due to prepayments of term license fees 
the decrease reflects the lower average remaining life of our term licenses 
the renewal value of our term licenses has declined by approximately since december  the timing of term license renewals can impact the licenses installments balance 
license installments would increase during periods when term license revenue exceeds billings 
term licenses scheduled for renewal in are modestly higher than actual term license renewals in generally  in prior periods  we have recognized the present value of committed future term license payments upon customer acceptance at the beginning of the license term 
in some cases  we are beginning to recognize revenue under some of our term licenses over the term of the agreement as payments become due  or ratably over the term of the license when payments are made in advance 
with respect to a particular term license transaction  this would result in less license revenue in the initial period and more license revenue during the remainder of the license term  but would not change the expected cash flow 
while historically a majority of customers have renewed their term licenses  there can be no assurance that this will continue 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from two primary sources software license fees and service fees 
software revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
our license arrangements  whether involving a perpetual license or a term license  generally contain multiple elements 
in addition to the license  these elements generally include professional consulting services  training and maintenance services 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the license and  therefore  recognize revenue based on the residual value method as prescribed in statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we typically determine fair value for the non license elements as the price for such elements when sold separately 
revenue from arrangements in which the fair value of one or more undelivered elements is unknown is deferred until the fair value of those elements is known and the residual value of the license can be determined 
perpetual license fees are generally payable at the time the software is delivered  and are generally recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract is obtained  and no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements that generally have a five year term and may be renewed for additional years at the customer s option 
we have a history of successfully collecting payments under such term software license arrangements  and therefore  the present value of future license payments is generally recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
a portion of the license fees payable under each term license agreement equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term 
many of our license agreements provide for license fee increases based on inflation 
when such an increase occurs  as determined by the terms of the license agreement  we recognize the present value of such increases as revenue  the remainder of the increase is recognized as installment receivable interest income over the remaining license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used are estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and for the past few years 
as a result  revenue that we recognize relative to new license arrangements of this type would be impacted by changes in market interest rates 
our standard license terms provide that the software is accepted upon delivery 
some of our license arrangements  however  provide that the acceptance does not occur until later  based on customer specific criteria 
in the future we expect to increasingly enter into term licenses with contract provisions that require the term license revenue to be recognized over the term of the agreement as payments become due  or ratably over the term of the license when payments are made in advance 
our services revenue is comprised of fees for software implementation  consulting  maintenance and training services 
implementation and consulting services generally do not involve producing new software or 
table of contents customizing or modifying the licensed software  but rather involve helping customers create rule sets that enable those customers to deploy the software to their specific business processes 
our software implementation and consulting agreements typically require us to provide services on a time and material basis or a fixed fee 
revenues for time and material projects are recognized as services are delivered and fees are billed 
as the services provided are not essential to the functionality of the software and are described in the agreement such that the total price of the arrangement would be expected to vary as the result of the inclusion or exclusion of the services  we account separately for the services element of the arrangement and allocate revenue accordingly among the elements based on the fair value 
our fair value for the rate per service hour is established as the actual rate charged per hour for time and materials services that have been sold separately 
the fair value of services is determined by multiplying the fair value rate per hour by the services hours incurred  or committed 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of fixed price services projects because we do not have a reliable track record for accurately estimating the time and resources needed to complete such projects 
revenue for fixed price services projects is recognized as the services are provided based upon the hours incurred at amounts equal to direct costs incurred  up to the amounts billed to date  resulting in no gross profit recognized until completion of the project 
generally  when the fixed price services project is complete  the remaining revenue and gross profit associated with the fixed price services project is recognized 
software license customers are offered the option to enter into a maintenance contract  which usually requires the customer to pay a monthly maintenance fee over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically renewable annually 
prepaid maintenance fees are deferred and are recognized evenly over the term of the maintenance agreement 
we generally recognize training fees revenue as the services are provided 
we have very limited revenue through resellers  therefore we typically have not provided price protection or stock rotation rights 
we have  in a small number of instances  provided limited rights of return or cancellation 
we record allowances for estimates of potential credit memos and sales returns when the related revenue is recorded  and review them periodically 
these estimates are based on historical analyses of credit memo and sales return data  current economic trends  and experience with customer disputes  the relevant products and the customer industry products 
these estimated amounts are deferred or reserved until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer or the dispute is resolved 
we warrant that our software products will conform to documented specifications 
we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which we are already obligated to provide  and consequently we have not established reserves for warranty obligations 
our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
we do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  we have not established any related reserves 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of billed fees from arrangements for which acceptance of the software license or completion of fixed price services has not occurred  the unearned portion of services revenue and advance payment of maintenance fees 
when the value of committed and undelivered services to be delivered after license implementation is known  we defer that amount until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer 
the timing of revenue recognized under our arrangements with customers is impacted by these deferrals  but the total value of revenue recognized during the arrangements is not 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for credit memos we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts using estimates that we make based on factors we believe appropriate such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
we record allowances for estimates of potential credit memos and sales returns when the related revenue is recorded and review them periodically 
we base these estimates on historical analyses of credit memo and sales return data  current economic trends  and our experience with customer disputes  the relevant products and customer industry 
these estimated amounts are deferred or reserved until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer or the dispute is resolved 
if we used different assumptions in calculating the allowance  adjustments would be reflected as changes to revenue 
during the first quarter of  we refined our estimate of allowances for credit memos which resulted in an increase in services revenue of million 
stock based compensation we periodically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees  non employee directors and contractors with an exercise price greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant 
historically  we have accounted for stock option grants to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with stock awards to employees and directors is determined as the difference  if any  between the current fair value of the underlying common stock on the date compensation is measured and the price the employee or director must pay to exercise the award 
the measurement date for employee and director awards is generally the date of grant 
stock options granted to contractors are accounted for using the fair value method 
under the fair value method  compensation associated with stock awards to contractors is determined based on the estimated fair value of the award itself  measured using either current market data or an established option pricing model 
at december   we had four stock based compensation plans  which are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
no stock based employee compensation expense was recorded in  or  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price greater than or equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and were granted only to employees and directors 
however  we have disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements the pro forma effect on our statement of income if we had employed the fair value method of accounting for stock option grants 
for purposes of that disclosure  we have used the black scholes multiple pricing model to value the options granted which has required us to make certain assumptions including the average life of options  the volatility of our stock price and the risk free rate of return 
our assumption regarding the average life of our options and the volatility of our stock was based on an analysis of our historical stock option exercises and stock price as reported by nasdaq over a period approximating the assumed average life of our options and ending on the date the determination is being made 
our assumption regarding the risk free rate of return is based on us treasury note yields 
the effects on pro forma net income and earnings per share of the estimated fair value of stock options and estimated dilutive shares are not necessarily representative of the effects on the results of operations in the future 
in addition  the estimates made utilize a pricing model developed for traded options with relatively short lives  our option grants typically have a life of up to ten years and are not transferable 
therefore  the actual fair value of a stock option grant may be different from our estimates 
we believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 

table of contents in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas r is effective with respect to us for reporting periods commencing on or after january  on april   in response to the issuance of sfas r  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved accelerating the vesting of out of the money  unvested stock options held by certain current employees  excluding officers as defined under section a of the securities exchange act of unvested options having an exercise price greater than per share  representing the right to purchase a total of approximately million shares  became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
all other terms and conditions in the original grants remain unchanged 
the acceleration of vesting did not result in the recognition of compensation expense for the year ended december  as the exercise price was in excess of the fair market value on the date of modification resulting in no intrinsic value under apb the notes to our consolidated financial statements disclose approximately million of pro forma compensation expense in resulting from the vesting acceleration 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would otherwise be recognized after the adoption of sfas r 
we estimate that the maximum future compensation expense that would otherwise have been recorded  based on adopting sfas r on january   was approximately million 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective approach 
sfas r requires that a company recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees ratably over the service period 
in addition  sfas r requires that excess tax benefits related to stock compensation expense be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r is estimated to result in an after tax compensation expense for unvested stock options outstanding at december  of approximately million in the total after tax compensation expense  including the cost of options that are expected to be granted during  is expected to be up to million 
however  uncertainties  including the number of stock option grants  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behavior  make it difficult to determine whether the stock based compensation expense that we will incur in future periods will be similar to this estimate 
accounting for income taxes judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties  transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries  and potential challenges to nexus and tax credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact  unfavorable or favorable  on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
provisions have been made for such uncertainties  with reserves totaling approximately million as of december  we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized 
table of contents using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
principal differences between our book and tax accounts are related to the treatment of our license transactions 
we use the operating lease method of recognizing license revenue for tax purposes  so that to the extent we continue to enter into term license contracts  we establish deferred tax liabilities for such future taxable income 
in addition  because we defer recognition of this income into future periods for tax purposes  as of december   we had generated approximately million in us tax loss carry forwards which partially offset the related liabilities 
we also earn tax credits in various jurisdictions for our ongoing investment in research and development activities 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million of credits carried forward because they would generally be utilized after net operating losses have been consumed exposing us to uncertainties regarding our ability to realize these credits 
our remaining valuation allowance relates to tax benefits from stock option exercises which will increase equity  loss carry forwards acquired in the mind acquisition  the recognition of which will generally reduce goodwill  and credits that will expire un utilized 
if we are late in filing income taxes for foreign subsidiaries  the taxing authorities in those jurisdictions may levy punitive or jeopardy assessments which can grow over time 
the amounts billed during these periods may be much higher than what is ultimately owed 
during the delinquent period  the differences between estimated taxes and actual taxes ultimately owed may result in a higher income tax provision 
upon filing of the foreign income tax returns and claims for refund of overpayment  the taxing jurisdiction provides a notice of overpayment  if any  which is then recorded as a reduction to our provision for income taxes 
contingencies from time to time  we are threatened with or become party to litigation 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  should be recorded 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date  and we do not expect it to have a significant impact in the future 
our unbilled license and maintenance fees are typically subject to annual increases based on recognized inflation indices 
significant customers no customer accounted for or more of our total revenue in or first data resources accounted for of our total revenue in in  another customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately of our total revenue in from sales to customers based outside of the united states 
some of our international sales are denominated in foreign currencies  such as the british pound and euro 
the price in united states dollars of products and services sold outside the united states in foreign currencies will vary as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates against those foreign currencies 
there can be no assurance that sales denominated in foreign currencies will not be material in the future and that there will not be increases in the value of the united states dollar against such currencies that will reduce the dollar return to us on the sale of our products and services in such foreign currencies 
the foreign currency exposure related to revenue is largely offset by the expenses we incur in foreign currencies 
because most of our transactions with customers are invoiced from our offices in the us  and some of those transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we have receivables and license installments that are valued in other currencies 
in addition  our us operating company holds some cash and investments in currencies other than the us dollar in order to support operations in other countries 
when there are changes in the exchange rates for those other currencies versus the us dollar functional currency we recognize a currency gain or loss in the statement of income as other income expense related to foreign currency transactions 
we had net assets valued in foreign currencies  consisting primarily of cash  investments  license installments  and receivables  partially offset by accounts payable and accruals  with a carrying value of million as of december  a ten percent change in currency exchange rates would change by approximately million the carrying value of those net assets as reported on our balance sheet as of december   with most of that change recognized in the statement of income as other income expense 
interest rate exposure our balance sheet contains interest bearing assets which have fixed rates of interest 
these assets include license installments receivable generated in the normal course of business through transactions with customers and investments of excess cash in marketable debt securities 
license installments receivable bear interest at the rate in effect when the license revenue was recognized  which does not vary throughout the life of the contractual cash flow stream 
we believe that at current market interest rates  the fair value of license installments receivable approximates the carrying value as reported on our balance sheets 
however  there can be no assurance that the fair market value will approximate the carrying value in the future 
factors such as increasing interest rates can reduce the fair market value of the license installments receivable 
changes in market rates do not affect net earnings  as the license installments receivable are carried at cost and  since they are not financial instruments and are held until maturity  are not marked to market to reflect changes in the fair value of the portfolio 
the carrying value of million as of december  reflects the weighted average of historic discount rates used to record each term license arrangement 
the average rate changes with market rates as new license installments receivable are added to the portfolio  which mitigates exposure to market interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our license installments receivable by approximately million as of december  we have invested in fixed rate marketable debt securities 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our marketable debt securities by approximately million as of december  changes in market rates and the related impact on fair value of the investments do not generally affect net earnings as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
