general general cable is a leader in the development  design  manufacture  marketing and distribution of copper  aluminum and fiber optic wire and cable products for the energy  industrial specialty and communications markets 
energy cables include low  medium and high voltage power distribution and power transmission products for overhead and buried applications 
industrial specialty wire and cable products conduct electrical current for industrial  oem  commercial and residential power and control applications 
communications wire and cable products transmit low voltage signals for voice and data applications 
certain statements in this report including  without limitation  statements regarding future financial results and performance  plans and objectives  capital expenditures and the company s or management s beliefs  expectations or opinions  are forward looking statements  and as such  general cable desires to take advantage of the safe harbor which is afforded such statements under the private securities litigation reform act of the company s forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company s comments on page of this report under the heading  disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those statements as a result of factors  risks and uncertainties over which the company has no control 
for a list of some of these factors  risks and uncertainties  see item a 
general cable analyzes its worldwide operations in two geographic groups north america and international 
corporate charges represent non recurring charges 
for more detail  see item of this report 
the following table sets forth net sales and operating income by geographic group for the periods presented  in millions of dollars year ended december  amount amount amount net sales north america international total net sales operating income loss north america international subtotal corporate charges total operating income 
table of contents over of net sales in the company s international operations are derived from energy and industrial specialty cable sales and the european business specifically is currently benefiting from medium voltage energy cable capacity shortage in europe and a shift towards environmentally friendly construction cables 
general cable s reported net sales are directly influenced by the price of copper  and to a lesser extent  aluminum 
the price of copper and aluminum has historically been subject to considerable volatility 
the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaged per pound in  per pound in and per pound in and the daily price of aluminum rod averaged per pound in  per pound in and per pound in general cable generally passes changes in copper and aluminum prices along to its customers  although there are timing delays of varying lengths depending upon the volatility of metals prices  the type of product  competitive conditions and particular customer arrangements 
a significant portion of the company s energy and communications business and  to a lesser extent  the company s industrial business has metal escalators written into customer contracts under a variety of price setting and recovery formulas 
the remainder of the company s business requires that the cost of higher metal prices be recovered through negotiated price increases with customers 
in these instances  the ability to increase the company s selling prices may lag the movement in metal prices by a period of time as the customer price increases are implemented 
as a result of this and a number of other practices intended to match copper and aluminum purchases with sales  profitability over time has historically not been significantly affected by changes in copper and aluminum prices  although and profitability did suffer due to high unrecovered raw material costs 
general cable does not engage in speculative metals trading or other speculative activities 
the company is also experiencing significant inflationary pressure on raw materials other than copper and aluminum used in cable manufacturing  such as insulating compounds  steel and wood reels  freight costs and energy costs 
the company has increased selling prices in most of its markets in order to offset the negative effect of increased raw material prices and other costs 
however  the company s ability to ultimately realize these price increases will be influenced by competitive conditions in its markets  including underutilized manufacturing capacity 
in addition  a continuing rise in raw material prices  when combined with the normal lag time between an announced customer price increase and its effective date in the market  may result in the company not fully recovering these increased costs 
if the company were not able to adequately increase selling prices in a period of rising raw material costs  the company would experience a decrease in reported earnings 
general cable generally has experienced and expects to continue to experience certain seasonal trends in sales and cash flow 
larger amounts of cash are generally required during the first and second quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the spring and summer months  when construction activity increases 
in general  receivables related to higher sales activity during the spring and summer months are collected during the fourth quarter of the year 
current business environment the wire and cable industry is competitive  mature and cost driven 
in many business segments  there is little differentiation among industry participants from a manufacturing or technology standpoint 
during and throughout  the company s end markets have continued to demonstrate improvement from the low points of demand experienced in there has been significant merger and acquisition activity which  the company believes  may lead to a reduction in the deployment of inefficient  high cost capacity in the industry 
in the energy segment  the power outages in the us  canada and europe emphasized a need to upgrade the power transmission infrastructure used by electric utilities  which may  over time  cause an increase in demand for general cable s energy products 
in addition  tax legislation was passed in the united states in which includes the renewal of tax credits for producing power from wind 
this may also cause an increase in demand for the company s products as the company is a significant manufacturer of wire and cable used in wind farms 
as a result of the passage of energy legislation in the united states in that is aimed at improving the transmission grid infrastructure and the reliability of power availability and as a result of the growing energy needs of emerging economies in asia  the middle east and africa  increased demand for the company s transmission and distribution cables may occur over time 
a volume increase in energy segment sales is already occurring and in combination with increased selling prices is leading to improvements in energy segment operating margins 
demand for both bare aluminum transmission cable and medium voltage distribution cable strongly increased during the fourth quarter of in the industrial specialty segment  industrial construction spending in north america  which influences industrial cable demand  has not fully recovered to reach the peak levels experienced during the mid s 
the company saw strengthening demand throughout as a direct result of a strong turnaround in industrial construction spending in north america 
this segment has also experienced increased demand for marine  mining and oil and gas exploration products as well as portable power cords 
over the last few years  the communications segment has experienced a significant decline from historical spending levels for outside plant telecommunications products and a weak market for switching local area networking cables 
overall demand for communications wire and cable products from the company s traditional regional bell operating 
table of contents company customers has declined over the last several quarters and may continue to decline  but the company has temporarily benefited from the consolidation of competitors which occurred during in the communications market 
the company will also benefit from the substantially completed closure of its bonham  texas and dayville  connecticut facilities which will allow the company to better utilize its communications manufacturing assets 
the company is also benefiting from increases in enterprise networking cable sales 
the company anticipates  based on regulatory announcements  further deployment of fiber optic products into the telephone network 
increased spending by the telephone companies on fiber deployment may negatively impact their purchases of the company s copper based telecommunications cable products 
however  this impact may be somewhat mitigated in that the company believes it will benefit from the further investment in fiber broadband networks by some of its customers who will most likely need to upgrade a portion of their copper network to support the fiber network 
in addition to the operating trends discussed in the previous paragraph  the company anticipates that the following trends may negatively affect the earnings of the company during the impact of continued rising raw materials costs  including metals and insulating materials  and freight and energy costs has increased the company s working capital requirements which have in turn increased the company s average outstanding debt level and its interest expense 
in addition  due to the anticipated continued rise in interest rates in the united states  the company s interest expense on its floating rate asset based revolver is expected to increase during this impact  however  is expected to be offset by the interest savings resulting from the entry of the company into a us dollar to euro cross currency and interest rate swap agreement as announced on october  the agreement has a notional value of million  or approximately of the company s currently outstanding million in senior notes 
the swap has a term of just over two years with a maturity date that coincides with the earliest redemption date of the senior notes 
this agreement lowers the company s borrowing cost by basis points on the swapped portion of the senior notes  or approximately million per year in interest expense 
cash interest savings through december  as a result of the swap is approximately million 
general cable believes its investment in lean six sigma training  coupled with effectively utilized manufacturing assets  provides a cost advantage compared to many of its competitors and generates cost savings which help offset rising raw material prices and other general economic cost increases 
in addition  general cable s customer and supplier integration capabilities  one stop selling and geographic and product balance are sources of competitive advantage 
as a result  the company believes it is well positioned  relative to many of its competitors  in the current business environment 
as part of general cable s ongoing efforts to reduce total operating costs  the company continuously evaluates its ability to more efficiently utilize existing manufacturing capacity 
such evaluation includes the costs associated with and benefits to be derived from the combination of existing manufacturing assets into fewer plant locations and the possible outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes 
during  the company completed the closure of certain of its industrial manufacturing plants which resulted in a million charge in the fourth quarter of of which approximately million were cash payments and a million charge in of which approximately million were cash payments 
during  the company also closed its rod mill operation and sold certain equipment utilized in that operation which resulted in a net gain of million 
during  the company closed certain of its communications cable manufacturing plants which resulted in a million charge in of which approximately million were cash payments  which included a million gain from the sale of a previously closed manufacturing plant 
total charges for these communication plant closures were approximately million of which approximately million were cash payments 
as of december   production had ceased at both locations 
acquisitions and divestitures general cable actively seeks to identify key trends in the industry to migrate its business to capitalize on expanding markets and new niche markets or exit declining or non strategic markets in order to achieve better returns 
the company also sets aggressive performance targets for its business and intends to refocus or divest those activities which fail to meet targets or do not fit long term strategies 
during the second quarter of  general cable formed a joint venture company to manufacture and market fiber optic cables 
general cable contributed assets  primarily inventory and machinery and equipment  to a subsidiary company which was then contributed to the joint venture in exchange for a million note receivable which resulted in a million deferred gain on the transaction 
the december  balance sheets included a million note receivable from the joint venture partner in other non current assets and a deferred gain from the initial joint venture formation of million in other liabilities 
in january  the company reduced its ownership percentage in the joint venture from to and as a result the deferred gain was reduced to million 
beginning in the first quarter of the company consolidated the joint venture company as a result of the adoption of fasb interpretation fin no 
 as revised  consolidation of variable interest entities 
for  the joint venture had sales of million  an operating loss of million and a 
table of contents net loss of million 
prior to the first quarter of  the joint venture company was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
at december   other non current assets included an investment in the joint venture of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company exchanged the note receivable from the former joint venture partner for the partner s ownership interest in the joint venture company 
the ownership interest acquired was recorded at fair value which was million less than the carrying value of the note receivable  net of the deferred gain  which resulted in a million charge 
as a result of this transaction  general cable owned of the fiber optic joint venture company at december   which during was merged into its principal us operating subsidiary 
in the first quarter of  the company acquired certain assets of draka comteq s business in north america for a purchase price of million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments 
the company incurred million of costs and expenses associated with the acquisition 
the net assets acquired are located in franklin  massachusetts and manufacture specialty electronics and datacom products 
the assets acquired included machinery and equipment  inventory  prepaid assets and intangible assets  net of the assumption of trade payables 
the purchase price has been allocated based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition 
the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
during the second quarter of  the final purchase price was agreed with draka resulting in a cash payment of approximately million to the company 
on december   the company announced the completion of its purchase of the shares of the wire and cable manufacturing business of safran sa  a diverse  global high technology company 
the acquired business is known under the name silec cable  sas silec 
silec is based in montereau  france and employs approximately  associates with nearly one million square feet of manufacturing space in that location 
in  silec reported global sales of approximately million of which about were linked to the energy infrastructure 
in the high voltage and extra high voltage market  silec is a recognized leader around the world providing the critical link to bring power from the grid into major urban areas 
the consideration paid for the acquisition was approximately million including fees and expenses at closing which represented of the total estimated purchase price  subject to adjustment under the terms of the definitive share purchase agreement 
on december   the company announced the acquisition of the mexican ignition wire set business of beru ag  a worldwide leading manufacturer of diesel cold start systems 
the acquired business is known under the name beru sa de sa beru sa beru sa is based in cuernavaca  mexico and employs approximately associates with one hundred thousand square feet of manufacturing space 
beru sa operates an automotive aftermarket assembly and distribution operation with annual revenues of approximately million per year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a summary of significant accounting policies is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  information that is available to management about current events and actions the company may take in the future and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most critical judgments impacting the financial statements include determinations with respect to inventory costing and valuation  pension accounting  the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and revenue recognition which are discussed below 
in addition  significant estimates and judgments are also involved in the valuation allowances for sales incentives and accounts receivable  legal  environmental  asbestos and customer reel deposit liabilities  assets and obligations related to other post retirement benefits  and self insured workers compensation and health insurance reserves 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates used in the application of its accounting policies and adjusts amounts in the financial statements as necessary 
inventory costing and valuation general cable utilizes the lifo method of inventory accounting for its metals inventory 
the company s use of the lifo method results in its income statement reflecting the current costs of metals  while metals inventories in the balance sheet are valued at historical costs as the lifo layers were created 
as a result of volatile copper prices  the replacement cost of the company s copper inventory exceeded the historic lifo cost by approximately million at december  and by approximately million at december  if lifo inventory quantities are reduced in a period when replacement 
table of contents costs exceed the lifo value of the inventory  the company would experience an increase in reported earnings 
conversely  if lifo inventory quantities are reduced in a period when replacement costs are lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would experience a decline in reported earnings 
if the company was not able to recover the lifo value of its inventory at a profit in some future period when replacement costs were lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would be required to take a charge to recognize in its income statement all or a portion of the higher lifo value of the inventory 
during  the company reduced its copper inventory quantities in north america resulting in a million lifo gain since lifo inventory quantities were reduced in a period when replacement costs were higher than the lifo value of the inventory 
the company periodically evaluates the realizability of its inventory 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed to be technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition or where inventory costs exceeds net realizable value  the company records a charge to cost of goods sold and reduces the inventory to its net realizable value 
pension accounting pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans sponsored by general cable is determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
this assumption was based on input from actuaries  including their review of historical year  year  and year rates of inflation and real rates of return on various broad equity and bond indices in conjunction with the diversification of the asset portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of allocated to equity investments  with an expected real rate of return of  and to fixed income investments  with an expected real rate of return of  and an assumed long term rate of inflation of 
the actual asset allocations were of equity investments and of fixed income investments at december  and because of market fluctuations  the actual asset allocations as of december  were of equity investments and of fixed income investments 
management believes that long term asset allocations on average will approximate the company s assumptions and that an long term rate of return is a reasonable assumption 
the determination of pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans is based on the fair market value of assets as of the measurement date 
investment gains and losses are recognized in the measurement of assets immediately 
such gains and losses will be amortized and recognized as part of the annual benefit cost to the extent that unrecognized net gains and losses from all sources exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of assets 
the determination of future pension obligations utilizes a discount rate based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency which are expected to be available during the period to maturity of the projected pension benefit obligations  and input from our actuaries 
the discount rate used at december  was  a decrease from the discount rate of used in the prior year 
the decrease was due to changes in the bond yield curve 
general cable evaluates its actuarial assumptions at least annually  and adjusts them as necessary 
in  pension expense for the company s defined benefit plans was million 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates its pension expense for its defined benefit plans will increase approximately million from  excluding curtailment costs  primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate and poorer than expected investment performance in a decrease in the assumed discount rate  excluding curtailment costs  would increase pension expense by approximately million 
future pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans 
in the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions  the funded status of the defined benefit plans may change and any such change could result in a charge or credit to equity and an increase or decrease in future pension expense and cash contributions 
deferred income tax valuation allowance general cable records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation of the deferred tax asset is dependent on  among other things  the ability of the company to generate a sufficient level of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  the company has considered both positive and negative evidence  such as historical and forecasted results of operations  including the losses realized in recent periods  and has considered the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had recorded a net deferred tax asset of million million current and million long term 
approximately million of this deferred tax asset must be utilized prior to its expiration in the period the remainder of the asset may be used for at least years 
this finite life has also been considered by the company in the valuation of the asset 
the company has and will continue to review on a quarterly basis its assumptions and tax planning 
table of contents strategies and  if the amount of the estimated realizable net deferred tax asset is less than the amount currently on the balance sheet  the company would reduce its deferred tax asset  recognizing a non cash charge against reported earnings 
at december   the company concluded that  more likely than not  the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to the customer  title and risk of loss are transferred  pricing is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
most revenue transactions represent sales of inventory 
a provision for payment discounts  product returns and customer rebates is estimated based upon historical experience and other relevant factors and is recorded within the same period that the revenue is recognized 
the company also has revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables where the multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting when the delivered items have value on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of undelivered items and the general right of return is substantially in the control of the company 
revenue arrangements of this type are generally contracts where the company is hired to both produce and install a certain product 
revenue is recognized for the product upon delivery to the customer but revenue recognition on installation is deferred until installation is complete

under this directive  a commercial user should apply fasb no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  for all old waste prior to august  that falls under the directive by setting up an asset retirement obligation liability for the costs associated with the waste 
fsp fas became effective for historical waste covered by the directive as of the first reporting period ending after june  the adoption of fsp fas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement this proposed interpretation clarifies accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas no 
specifically  the interpretation requires recognition of a company s best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained by an audit based only on the technical merits of the position 
tax positions failing the probable recognition threshold would result in adjustments in recorded deferred tax assets or liabilities and changes in income tax payables or receivables 
this interpretation  as originally drafted  would become effective for the first fiscal year ending after december  however  the fasb currently does not expect to issue a final interpretation until the first quarter of  so the effective date will be modified

the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this proposed interpretation on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued an exposure draft  earnings per share an amendment of fasb statement no 
this proposed statement seeks to clarify guidance for mandatorily convertible instruments  the treasury stock method  contracts that may be settled in cash or shares  and contingently issuable shares 
the proposed statement would amend the computational guidance for calculating the number of incremental shares included in diluted shares when applying the treasury stock method  would further amend the treasury stock method to treat as assumed proceeds the carrying amount of an extinguished liability upon issuance of shares  would eliminate the provision of statement that allows an entity not to assume share settlement in contracts that may be settled in either cash or shares  would define a mandatorily convertible instrument and its effects on basic eps  and would eliminate the weighted average computation for calculating contingently issuable shares 
this statement  if approved  would become effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this proposed statement on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows

all segment figures have been restated for the reclassification of certain business units from the communications segment to the industrial specialty segment as discussed in item of this report 

table of contents net sales the following tables set forth metal adjusted net sales and metal pounds sold by segment  in millions 
net sales for have been adjusted to reflect the copper comex average price of per pound a increase compared to the prior period and the aluminum rod average price of per pound a increase compared to the prior period 
metal adjusted net sales year ended december  amount amount energy industrial specialty communications total metal adjusted net sales metal adjustment total net sales metal pounds sold year ended december  pounds pounds energy industrial specialty communications total metal pounds sold net sales increased to  million in from  million in after adjusting net sales to reflect the increase in the average monthly comex price per pound of copper and the increase in the average aluminum rod price per pound in  net sales increased to  million  up from  million in the net sales increase included a increase  or million  due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the increase in metal adjusted net sales reflects a increase in the energy segment  a increase in the industrial specialty segment and a increase in the communications segment 
metal pounds sold increased compared to metal pounds sold is provided herein as the company believes this metric to be a good measure of sales volume since it is not impacted by metal prices or foreign currency exchange rate changes and the company believes its product mix to be relatively constant year over year 
the increase in reported net sales in excess of that attributable to the increase in metal pounds sold is a result of the company s efforts to increase its selling prices to recover significant raw material cost increases on insulating compounds  steel and wood reels  and higher energy and freight costs 
the increase in net sales in this comparison also includes the million foreign currency benefit described above which does not impact the metal pounds sold comparison 
the increase in metal adjusted net sales for the energy segment reflects a increase in net sales in north america and a increase in net sales in the company s international operations 
the north american net sales reflect an increase in demand for bare aluminum transmission cable compared to  increased selling prices to recover significant raw material price increases  a better mix of products sold and a million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company expects to continue to experience inflationary pressure on its raw material costs and will continue to increase selling prices to offset the negative effect of rising raw material costs to the extent that it is able 
the company anticipates demand to accelerate due to the passing of energy legislation in the united states in aimed at improving the transmission grid infrastructure
