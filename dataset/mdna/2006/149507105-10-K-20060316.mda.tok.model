item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands overview cavalier homes  inc and its subsidiaries produce  sell and finance manufactured housing 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many of the same economic and demographic factors that affect the housing market as a whole 
as a result of the growth in the industry during much of the s  the number of retail dealerships  manufacturing capacity and wholesale shipments expanded significantly  which ultimately created slower retail turnover  higher retail inventory levels and increased price competition 
the industry also has been impacted by an increase in dealer failures  a severe reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels  each of which contributed to a reduction in wholesale industry shipments to a year low in industry results for posted the first increase since with floor shipments increasing over by due to industry wide orders by the federal emergency management agency fema as part of that agency s hurricane disaster relief efforts 
the manufactured housing institute mhi estimated fema shipments in the last four months of totaled approximately  floors  and in approximated  factoring out the effects of the fema orders in both and  industry shipments are stable 
industry company shipments and market share mhi reported that wholesale floor shipments were down cumulatively from january  through december  as noted in the following table floor shipments nationwide cavalier s core states increase increase increase increase decrease decrease market decrease decrease market year industry from prior year cavalier from prior year share industry from prior year cavalier from prior year share during this industry downturn  the company s shipments fell in and disproportionately to the industry decline which the company believes was due to its strategy  early in the downturn  of working closely with its dealers to assist them in reducing retail inventories  thereby reducing the risk of failure of dealers distributing company homes 
the years and resulted in significant market share gains for the company due mainly to its aggressive marketing strategies  especially product offerings  which were core to its plan for returning to profitability 
the company believes its reduction in market share in and was due to several factors 
external causes include an intensely competitive marketplace and a lack of chattel home only financing for all homes  especially single section homes  in the industry 
internally  the company s momentum was negatively impacted by the consolidation of its sales force and the closing of six home manufacturing facilities in during  the company entered into agreements with two companies to build  single section homes for delivery to fema as part of that agency s disaster relief for the gulf coast states hit by hurricanes 
under the agreements  the company shipped  single section homes  which accounted for of sales 
in  the company shipped  single section homes under fema related agreements 
during  the company s floor shipments increased over  while industry wide shipments increased  with the company s market share being 
in the company s core states  its market share was with shipments increasing compared to the industry increase of in those states 
periodically  the company reviews the composition of its sales by state and redefines the states included in its core states calculation 
because the company has increased shipments into tennessee and florida  the company redefined the composition of its core states calculation to include tennessee and florida for and the company s core states consist of louisiana  north carolina  tennessee  alabama  south carolina  georgia  mississippi  arkansas  missouri  oklahoma  and florida 
industry finance environment a major factor contributing to the manufactured housing industry growth in the s was the relaxation of credit standards due to intense competition  which ultimately resulted in a change in the financing approach in the industry due to underperforming manufactured housing loans 
throughout the past seven years  the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry  coupled with more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels and limit wholesale shipments of new homes 
while the current industry trend is toward more land home real estate financing rather than chattel or home only loans  additional chattel lending availability could result in renewed demand for single section products 
while land home financing generally offers more favorable credit terms to the retail buyer of manufactured housing  the length of time involved in closing land home transactions is greater 
the anticipated infusion of new and competitive lending capacity  which the company believes is essential to support demand at higher levels  has not materialized 
until there is substantial entry of finance resources to the manufactured housing market  the company believes a meaningful expansion for the industry will be delayed 
in april  general electric s commercial finance unit announced it had agreed to purchase the majority of bombardier capital  inc s inventory financing unit  which includes manufactured housing floor plan lending 
the company does not expect the purchase of bombardier s floor plan to have a material effect on cavalier s dealers ability to finance its product 
raw materials cost and gross margin although gross margin has increased in over  the company s gross margin has been negatively impacted by price increases in substantially all raw materials certain prices continue to increase and overall commodity pressures ie  global demand and capacity constraints and rising oil prices 
while the company seeks to offset rising costs through increasing its selling prices  sudden increases in raw material costs  coupled with dealers order backlogs  can affect the timing and ability of the company to pass on its cost increases 
the company is uncertain at this time as to the impact the extent and duration of the increased costs will have on the company s future revenue and earnings 
the company is currently on allocation from its traditional vendors for insulation  gypsum and shingles 
capacity and overhead cost in response to the continued weakening of industry market conditions  the company closed eight manufacturing facilities between the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of in february  the company closed its ft 
worth  texas facility 
the company generally has been able to sell to the customers of these plants with the exception of the pennsylvania and texas plants from one or more of the company s current operating plants 
the remaining plants also handle dealer sales and customer service for the company s homes 
in terms of operating costs  the company has made cost reductions in virtually all areas of operations  including its exclusive dealer and marketing programs and its administrative personnel and associated costs 
in september  the company re opened its winfield  alabama facility in order to assist in the production of the fema units mentioned above and incurred in capital expenditures in conjunction with reopening the winfield facility 
the company is continuing to evaluate its options regarding capacity and expects the winfield facility to remain open to fulfill anticipated demand as the gulf coast region is re built following the hurricane damages 
debt and liquidity the company improved its long term debt position by making scheduled principal repayments as well as making additional principal repayments from proceeds from sales of certain property 
during  the company reduced long term debt by  from  to  industrial real estate development term bonds loan totals balance  beginning of year    principal repayments scheduled   from proceeds of property sales   balance  end of year    during the fourth quarter of  the company borrowed  under the revolving line of credit  in order to fund the company s short term cash needs required to fulfill the outstanding fema related order 
during the first quarter of  the line of credit balance was paid in full 
the company did not have any amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit at december  as of december   the company had outstanding accounts receivable related to the sales of fema homes of  of which  had been collected through march  outlook for  the manufactured housing industry posted a strong increase over shipments due largely to the impact of fema orders after hurricanes devastated housing in many areas in the gulf coast region 
mhi estimated the manufactured housing industry provided approximately  homes for fema during compared to  homes for during  the company shipped  single section homes under fema related agreements and shipped homes remaining under the agreements in the first quarter of beyond  the company believes the massive storm damage will create opportunities for both the industry and the company s growth outside of the temporary housing supplied through fema orders in cavalier expects that strain on conventional home building resources will likely cause some of those looking to replace damaged homes to consider manufactured housing  including modular homes  as a viable alternative to traditional site built housing 
the company expects rebuilding efforts to impose greater strains on availability of certain building materials which will likely result in increased costs 
longer term  substantial entry of competitive lending capacity in the industry  which the company believes is essential to support demand at higher levels  is needed for a meaningful expansion for the industry 
the company believes the steps taken to reduce its costs and lower its breakeven point coupled with the remaining deliveries under the fema agreements have positioned cavalier to continue with profitable operations into while the company currently expects the results of operations for to be profitable  changes in general economic conditions that affect consumer purchases  availability of adequate financing sources  increases in repossessions or dealer failures and extended commodity price increases could affect the results of operations of the company

cavalier attributes the increase in sales and shipments primarily to the fema units shipped

the overall increase included a  increase in salaries  including engineering costs  and incentive compensation based on improved profitability of the company  increased insurance costs  primarily general and product liability  of  and a increase in losses on the company s installment loan portfolio  including homes repossessed 
these increases were offset by a reduction in accounting and auditing fees associated with compliance efforts under section of the sarbanes oxley act of impairment and other related charges during  the company recorded impairment and other related charges of after tax or per diluted share to writedown property  plant and equipment in connection with the valuation of a home manufacturing facility closed in a prior year 
operating income loss operating income for was  compared to  in segment operating results were as follows home manufacturing operating income  before intercompany eliminations  was  in as compared to  in the increased home manufacturing operating income is primarily due to improved gross profit as and the company s participation in building single section homes as part of the fema disaster relief as discussed above 
financial services operating income was in as compared to in the revenue increase from the financial services segment was primarily offset by increases in losses on the company s installment loan portfolio as discussed above 
the retail segment s operating loss improved from in to almost breakeven in primarily due to startup costs associated with a new retail location opened in the fourth quarter of that did not recur in general corporate operating expense  which is not identifiable to a specific segment  increased from  in to  in primarily due to increased incentive compensation costs paid on improved corporate earnings in offset by reduced expenses associated with compliance efforts under the sox act of other income expense interest expense increased primarily due to higher interest charges on amounts outstanding under the retail floor plan agreement in of which lower amounts were outstanding in and for borrowings under the revolving line of credit in to fund short term cash requirements to complete the fema order 
these increases in interest expense were offset somewhat by decreased interest charges on lower debt amounts outstanding on industrial development revenue bonds and the real estate term loan

income loss from continuing operations before income taxes the company s pre tax income from continuing operations was  reflecting an improvement from  in  due to the factors discussed above 
income taxes in  the company recorded a income tax benefit as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against current taxable income and the reduction of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
realization of deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
in  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  because the company had operated at a cumulative loss in its three most recent calendar years and because it believed difficult competitive and economic conditions might continue for the foreseeable future  a  valuation allowance was recorded to fully reserve net deferred tax assets 
however  in  as a result of continued improvements in operating performance and projected income and tax liability for  the company reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance realizing  in deferred tax benefits 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considered all positive and negative evidence  including anticipated operating results  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  and tax planning strategies 
because the company believes challenging industry conditions persist  the company believes that under the standards of sfas no 
it is not appropriate to record income tax benefits in excess of the benefit projected to be realized in as of december   the company maintained a valuation allowance of  the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred income tax assets are realized or the valuation allowances are otherwise no longer required

at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
the company has amounts outstanding under five industrial development revenue bond issues bonds which totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
four of the bond issues bear interest at variable rates ranging from to and mature at various dates through april one of the bond issues is payable in annual installments through with interest payable monthly at a variable rate currently at as determined by a remarketing agent 
the real estate term loan and the bonds are collateralized by substantially all of the company s plant facilities and equipment 
restricted bond funds of and are reflected as a non current asset in the consolidated balance sheets as december  and  respectively 
the company has  and  of notes payable under a retail floor plan agreement at december  and december   respectively 
the notes are collateralized by certain company owned retail stores new home inventories and bear interest rates ranging from prime to prime plus but not less than based on the age of the home 
since its inception  cis has been restricted in the amount of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
from time to time  the company evaluates the potential to sell all or a portion of its remaining installment loan portfolio  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cis in the future 
cis is currently re selling loans to other lenders under various retail finance contracts 
the company believes the periodic sale of installment contracts under these retail finance agreements will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase the company s liquidity  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance the ability of cis to increase its volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under these agreements  or that cis and the company will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreements 
the company currently believes existing cash and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  including expected payments on outstanding receivables related to the fema order  will be adequate to fund the company s operations and plans for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances to this effect 
if it is not  or if the company is unable to remain in compliance with its covenants under its credit facility  the company would seek to maintain or enhance its liquidity position and capital resources through modifications to or waivers under the credit facility  incurrence of additional short or long term indebtedness or other forms of financing  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions  the availability and terms of which will depend on various factors and market and other conditions  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
projected cash to be provided by operations in the coming year is largely dependent on sales volume 
the company s manufactured homes are sold mainly through independent dealers who generally rely on third party lenders to provide floor plan financing for homes purchased 
in addition  third party lenders generally provide consumer financing for manufactured home purchases 
the company s sales depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing for manufactured home purchasers and dealers as well as the company s own retail locations 
the availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry  the departure of financial institutions from the industry  the financial institutions lending practices  the strength of the credit markets generally  governmental policies and other conditions  all of which are beyond the company s control 
throughout the past six years the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry  coupled with more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels and limit wholesale shipments of new homes 
unfavorable changes in these factors and terms of financing in the industry may have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations or financial condition

although the commitments outstanding at december  have a finite life  these commitments are continually replaced as the company continues to sell its manufactured homes to dealers under repurchase and other recourse agreements with lending institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to dealers 
the cost  net of recoveries  of these contingent repurchase obligations to the company was   and 
the company has a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  based on prior experience and an evaluation of dealers financial conditions 
the company and certain of its equity partners have guaranteed certain debt for two companies in which the company owns a one third interest 
the guarantees are limited to of the outstanding debt 
at december    was outstanding under the guarantees  of which the company had guaranteed one of the companies has a lease purchase agreement with a third party to sell a facility financed by debt that the company has guaranteed 
the company has provided letters of credit to providers of certain of its surety bonds and insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
the outstanding letters of credit reduce amounts available under the company s credit facility 
the company has recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies 
critical accounting estimates cavalier follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors  current economic conditions and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
product warranties cavalier provides the initial retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors and current industry trends 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical sales amounts and warranty costs related to homes sold and any outstanding service work orders 
we have a reserve for estimated warranties of  and  
although we maintain reserves for such claims  based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims or per claim costs exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations 
insurance cavalier s workers compensation prior to february   and after april   product liability and general liability insurance coverages were provided under incurred loss  retrospectively rated premium plans 
under these plans  we incur insurance expense based upon various rates applied to current payroll costs and sales 
annually  such insurance expense is adjusted by the carrier for loss experience factors subject to minimum and maximum premium calculations 
refunds or additional premiums are estimated and recorded when sufficiently reliable data is available 
we were contingently liable at december  for future retrospective premium adjustments up to a maximum of approximately  in the event that additional losses are reported related to prior years 
we recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  related to these contingent claims 
claims exceeding our current expense levels could have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations 
reserve for repurchase commitments manufactured housing companies customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions  which provide wholesale floor plan financing to dealers 
a majority of cavalier s sales are made to dealers located primarily in the south central and south atlantic regions of the united states pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions 
these agreements generally provide that we will repurchase our new products from the lending institutions in the event of dealer default 
our risk of loss under repurchase agreements is reduced by the following factors sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a relatively large number of independent dealers  the largest of which accounted for approximately of sales in  excluding fema related sales  the price that cavalier is obligated to pay under such repurchase agreements declines based on predetermined amounts over the period of the agreement generally to months  and cavalier historically has been able to resell homes repurchased from lenders 
the company applies fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to account for its liability for repurchase commitments 
under the provisions of fin  issuance of a guarantee results in two different types of obligations a non contingent obligation to stand ready to perform under the repurchase commitment accounted for pursuant to fin and a contingent obligation to make future payments under the conditions of the repurchase commitment accounted for pursuant to sfas no 

cavalier reviews the retail dealers inventory to estimate the amount of inventory subject to repurchase obligation which is used to calculate the fair value of the non contingent obligation for repurchase commitments and the contingent liability based on historical information available at the time 
during the period in which a home is sold inception of a repurchase commitment  the company records the greater of these two calculations as a liability for repurchase commitments and as a reduction to revenue 
the company estimates the fair value of the non contingent portion of its manufacturer s inventory repurchase commitment under the provisions of fin when a home is shipped to dealers whose floor plan financing includes cavalier s repurchase commitment 
the fair value of the inventory repurchase agreement has been estimated on a pooled dealer approach based on the creditworthiness of the independent dealers  as determined by the floor plan institution  and is derived using an income approach 
specifically  the fair value of the inventory repurchase agreement is determined by calculating the net present value of the difference in a the interest cost to carry the inventory over the maximum repurchase liability period at the prevailing floor plan note interest rate and b the interest cost to carry the inventory over the maximum repurchase liability period at the interest rate of a similar type loan without a manufacturer s repurchase agreement in force 
the company estimates the contingent obligation to make future payments under its manufacturer s inventory repurchase commitment for the same pool of commitments as used in the fair value calculation above and records the greater of the two calculations 
this sfas no 
contingent obligation is estimated using historical loss factors  including the frequency of repurchases and the losses experienced by the company for repurchased inventory 
additionally  subsequent to the inception of the repurchase commitment  the company evaluates the likelihood that it will be called on to perform under the inventory repurchase commitments 
if it becomes probable that a dealer will default and a sfas no 
loss reserve should be recorded  then such contingent liability is recorded equal to the estimated loss on repurchase 
based on identified changes in dealers financial conditions  the company evaluates the probability of default for the group of dealers who are identified at an elevated risk of default and applies a probability of default to the group  based on historical default rates 
in this default probability evaluation  we review repurchase notifications received from floor plan sources and review our dealer inventory for expected repurchase notifications based on various communications from the lenders and the dealers as well as for dealers who  we believe  are experiencing financial difficulty 
the company s repurchase commitments for the dealers in the category of elevated risk of default are excluded from the pool of commitments used in both of the calculations at and above 
changes in the reserve are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
following the inception of the commitment  the recorded reserve is reduced over the repurchase period and is eliminated once the dealer sells the home 
the maximum amount for which we are contingently liable under repurchase agreements approximated  at december  we have a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  
changes in the level of retail inventories in the manufactured housing industry  either up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the deterioration in the availability of retail financing  along with significant competition from repossessed homes  experienced in recent years  extended the inventory adjustment period for excess industry retail inventory levels beyond what was originally expected 
if these trends were to continue  or if retail demand were to significantly weaken  the inventory overhang could result in even greater intense price competition  cause further pressure on profit margins within the industry  and have a material adverse effect on cavalier 
cavalier believes that inventories of its homes are at levels which are more consistent with retail demand  although we cannot provide investors assurances to this effect 
the company s inventory at all retail locations  including company owned retail sales centers  declined in from and declined by from to the reduction in retail inventory  and corresponding reduction in repurchase commitments  has been impacted in the last two years by the leveling of retail inventory with demand and by the industry s involvement in the production of fema related houses that do not carry a repurchase commitment 
in  as fema related production is replaced by traditional dealer purchases that carry inventory repurchase commitments  the company anticipates the non contingent portion of the reserve for repurchase commitments to increase 
impairment of long lived assets since the latter part of  cavalier and the manufactured housing industry have experienced a downturn in business as discussed above 
due to deteriorating market conditions  during this time  we have idled  closed or sold manufactured housing facilities  a portion of our insurance and premium finance business  a portion of our supply operations and under performing retail locations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such assets is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived assets 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that the fair market values are based primarily on independent appraisals and preliminary or definitive contractual arrangements less costs to dispose 
deferred tax asset realization of deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
in  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  because the company had operated at a cumulative loss in its three most recent calendar years and because it believed difficult competitive and economic conditions might continue for the foreseeable future  a  valuation allowance was recorded to fully reserve net deferred tax assets 
however  in  as a result of continued improvements in operating performance and projected income and tax liability for  the company reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance realizing  in deferred tax benefits 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers all positive and negative evidence  including anticipated operating results  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  and tax planning strategies 
because the company believes challenging industry conditions persist  the company believes that under the standards of sfas no 
it is not appropriate to record income tax benefits in excess of the benefit projected to be realized in as of december   the company maintained a valuation allowance of  the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred income tax assets are realized or the valuation allowances are otherwise no longer required

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments  but is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company purchases retail installment contracts from its dealers  at fixed interest rates  in the ordinary course of business  and periodically resells a majority of these loans to financial institutions under the terms of retail finance agreements 
the periodic resale of installment contracts reduces the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  as the majority of contracts are held for a short period of time
