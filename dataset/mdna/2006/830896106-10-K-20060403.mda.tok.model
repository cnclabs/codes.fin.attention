item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of management s discussion and analysis is to focus on certain significant factors which have affected our operating results and financial condition  and to provide shareholders a more comprehensive review of the financial data contained in this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto  included as pages f through f of this report 
items of significance in  we recorded net income of million or per share on a diluted basis compared to million or per share on a diluted basis in this represents an increase of  or in net income and or per share on a diluted basis between and this increase is due to an increase in net interest income of million arising from our growth 
our return on average equity for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  experienced a rising rate environment with prime interest rate increasing basis points  combined with intense competition for deposits in our market area 
as a result  our net interest margin has compressed from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the book value of our common stock increased from per share at december  to at december  total assets increased by million  or from the fiscal year ended december  total gross loans increased by million  or from the fiscal year ended december  capital adequacy ratios continue to meet the criteria of well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
as we remain committed to customer service  our technology improvement plan calls for the continued upgrading of the systems utilized on the teller platform and in customer service areas to allow employees to serve customers more efficiently 
in april  we opened our newest facility  located in assonet  massachusetts 
this branch is a state of the art full service banking office  designed to provide superior customer convenience and service 
financial condition total assets increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in total assets during is the result of planned growth across the balance sheet 
total net loans increased from million at december  to million  an increase of million or  while the investment portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of 
the combination of growth in deposits and fhlb advances funded the increase in loans and investments 
total deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
total fhlb advances increased by million or  to million at december  from million at december  investment portfolio the main objectives of our investment portfolio are to achieve a competitive rate of return over a reasonable time period and to provide liquidity 
our total investment portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of 
the increase is the result of the investment of excess funds from both deposits and borrowings into obligations of government sponsored entities and mortgage backed securities  which were raised in accordance with our strategic plans 
certain mortgage backed securities totaling million were purchased during as a direct replacement of loans  as loan pay offs exceeded management s expectations 
the current investment strategy has concentrated on the purchase of state and municipal obligations generally maturing or callable within five to seven years 
the investment policy also permits investments in mortgage backed securities  usually having a longer weighted average life 
the investment policy  however  limits the duration of the aggregate investment portfolio to years 
at december   the portfolio duration was years 
we do not purchase investments with imbedded derivative characteristics  or free standing derivative instruments such as swaps  options  or futures 
securities held to maturity the held to maturity portfolio consists of mortgage backed securities and securities issued by states and municipalities 
held to maturity securities decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease is the result of the maturity  calls and paydowns of certain state and municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities 
those funds were used to increase the available for sale portfolio to provide liquidity for future loan growth 
management has designated these mortgage backed securities to secure advances from the fhlb 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity

securities available for sale securities not designated as held to maturity are designated as available for sale 
although we do not anticipate the sale of these securities  the designation as available for sale allows us the flexibility to alter our investment strategies and sell these securities when conditions warrant 
additionally  marketable equity securities that have no maturity date must be designated as available for sale 
these securities are carried at fair value

loans our total loan portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
the increase is the result of continued loan growth initiatives  designed to invest the deposits and borrowings that were raised in accordance with our strategic plans 
although commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans have traditionally been our leading loan products  management has made considerable effort to diversify the loan portfolio over the past three years  adding significant levels of residential real estate loan products to the balance sheet 
management believes these loans will enhance our overall credit risk profile 
at december   our one to four family mortgage loans totaled million or of total gross loans  compared with million  or of total gross loans outstanding at december   while home equity lines of credit totaled million  or of our total gross loans  compared to million or of total gross loans at december  originations of residential real estate loans for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  gross home equity lines of credit totaled million and unadvanced funds committed under home equity lines of credit totaled million at december  the commercial real estate loan portfolio was million or of total loans at december  at december   commercial real estate loans totaled million or of total gross loans 
commercial real estate loan originations totaled million for the year ended december  at december   we had million of advanced construction loans that amounted to of our total gross loans  compared to million or of total gross loans at december  construction loan originations totaled million for the year ended december  unfunded portions of construction loans totaled million at december  other commercial loans totaled million or of the total gross loan portfolio at december   compared to million or at december  consumer loans at december  amounted to million  or of total gross loans  as compared to million or of total gross loans at december  the following table summarizes loans by category at the end of each of the last five years

loan portfolio rate sensitivity in our demographic market and relatively low interest rate environment  the origination of adjustable rate loans at our bank has been minimum 
additionally  our customer base tends to prefer fixed rate mortgage loans to adjustable rate loans 
accordingly  the portfolio of adjustable rate loans has declined significantly during the past three years 
adjustable rate mortgage loans totaled million  or of residential real estate loans at december  substantially all of our equity lines of credit have interest rates that adjust monthly with the wall street journal prime rate 
additionally  the market for commercial and commercial real estate loans in our market area is intense 
in response to the competition  we offer commercial real estate loans that adjust every five years  based on either the wall street journal prime rate or the treasury rate matching the adjustment period 
of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio  million  or have adjustable interest rates at december  the following table shows the contractual maturity distributions of all loan categories at december  within one to year five years after five years total in thousands real estate mortgage loans commercial     residential    construction and land development    home equity lines of credit   commercial  financial and agricultural     consumer    the following table shows the amounts  included in the preceding table  which are due after one year and which have fixed interest rates and adjustable interest rates total due after one year fixed rate adjustable rate total in thousands real estate mortgage loans commercial    residential    construction and land development    home equity lines of credit   commercial  financial and agricultural    consumer  loan delinquencies it is our policy to manage our loan portfolio in order to recognize problem loans at an early stage and thereby minimize loan losses 
loans are considered delinquent when any payment of principal or interest is one month or more past due 
we generally commence collection procedures when accounts are days past due 
generally  when a loan becomes past due days or more  management discontinues the accrual of interest and reverses previously accrued interest  unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
when a loan is determined to be uncollectible  it is charged off to the allowance for loan losses or  if applicable  any real estate that is securing the loan is acquired through foreclosure  and recorded on our books as other real estate owned 
management defines non performing loans to include non accrual loans  loans past due days or more and still accruing  and restructured loans not performing in accordance with amended terms 
the following table presents information regarding non performing loans in the portfolio december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans  loans days or more past due and still accruing total non performing loans  restructured debt performing in accordance with amended terms  not included above percentage of non accrual loans to total loans percentage of allowance for loan losses to non accrual loans  for the year ended december   interest income that would have been recorded if non accrual loans at december  had been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to  the actual interest recorded on these loans amounted to  for the year ended december  allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as either doubtful  substandard or special mention 
for such loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
as the composition of the loan portfolio gradually changes and diversifies from higher credit risk weighted loans  such as commercial real estate and commercial  to residential and home equity loans  a lower overall reserve allowance rate will be required 
during  stronger underwriting guidelines and overall improvement in credit quality of existing loans resulted in a decrease in the degree of credit risk embedded in the loan portfolio 
consequently  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding declined from at december  to at december  after thorough review and analysis of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance during  we recorded a provision for loan losses of  compared to  recorded for the year ended december  there were no loans charged off in compared with  for the year ended december  we realized recoveries of previously charged off loans totaling  for the year ended december  compared with recoveries totaling  for the year ended december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses of million as of december  is adequate to cover potential losses in the loan portfolio  based on current information available to management

deposits and borrowed funds we solicit depositors from our primary market area using rates and services designed to appeal to customers across a broad spectrum of ages and income levels 
we compete for deposit customers with community banks and credit unions  as well as local branches of regional and national banks 
despite this level of competition  our total deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
implementation of our coastal product line was designed to attract high balance customers with whom we have multiple product relationships

the advance programs allow the bank to borrow up to of total assets  but limited  based on the amount of qualified collateral as defined by the fhlb pledged  and the amount of fhlb preferred stock held 
fhlb advances are utilized as an additional funding source for loans and investments as well as a tool for controlling the levels of interest rate risk on the balance sheet 
fhlb advances are secured by a blanket lien on qualified collateral  consisting primarily of loans with first mortgages secured by one to four family properties and certain unencumbered investment securities 
in addition qualified commercial real estate loans are used as collateral to obtain additional fhlb advances 
short term borrowings include funds drawn under lines of credit with the fhlb and fhlb advances with an original maturity of less than one year 
total short term borrowings increased from zero at december  to million at december  at no time did the average balance of short term borrowings exceed of stockholders equity 
long term fhlb advances increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
the proceeds were utilized to fund loan and investment growth in excess of deposit growth  as well as to hedge the effects of rising short term interest rates on net interest income 
at december   outstanding long term fhlb advances had the following scheduled maturities and weighted average interest rates weighted final maturity amount average rate in thousands thereafter  although most advances are payable at maturity  advances totaling million are payable on an amortizing basis  in terms ranging from to months 
amortizing advances are being repaid in equal monthly payments and are being amortized from the date of the advance to the maturity date on a direct reduction basis 
also  certain advances are redeemable at the option of the fhlb  at par value on the call date and quarterly thereafter 
in march  we issued million in subordinated debentures 
the debentures mature in  and carry an adjustable interest rate equivalent to the three month libor plus basis points 
the rate adjusts every three months based on the change in the libor 
at december  the interest rate on the subordinated debentures was 
current bank and bank holding company regulations view these debentures as tier capital 
as such  we may leverage this regulatory capital in order to expand our franchise or otherwise enhance our earnings 
stockholders equity total stockholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily the result of net income of million 
net income was reduced by cash dividends declared totaling million 
other factors affecting total stockholders equity include the other comprehensive loss of million pertaining to net unrealized losses on securities available for sale  and the issuance of common stock through option and dividend reinvestment plans  totaling million 
results of operations our operating performance is dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
the level of net interest income achieved is impacted by several factors such as economic conditions  interest rates  asset liability management  and corporate tax and strategic planning 
the following table sets forth our average assets  liabilities  and stockholders equity  interest income earned and interest paid  average rates earned and paid  net interest spread and the net interest margin

the effect of including such loans  although not material  is to reduce the average rate earned on the company s loans 
rate volume analysis the following table presents the changes in components of net interest income for the years ended december  which are the result of changes in interest rates and the changes that are the result of changes in volume of the underlying asset or liability

this represents a increase in net income from the year ended december   where net income totaled million  or per share basic and per share diluted 
net interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   the direct result of our growth over the year 
we recognized a provision for loan losses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the past three years  we have made concerted efforts to enhance the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
continuing the dedication to loan quality that management has taken has resulted in a loan loss provision that management believes is in line with its growing loan portfolio 
non interest income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during the same period  non interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  income before taxes was million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  interest income increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase can be attributed to the growth in the loan portfolio  as the average balance of loans increased by million or 
the yield on the loan portfolio increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  interest and dividends on investments increased by million  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   the result of the growth in the investment portfolio 
the portfolio grew from an average balance of million to million 
income from federal funds sold increased from  to  the result of increased volume of overnight money 
interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   resulting primarily from the increased use of borrowings in the average balance of fhlb advances increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  management used borrowings to fund a substantial portion of our loan growth in during the period of low interest rates  we utilized longer term advances to fund loan originations in order to control interest rate risk 
as a result of the timing of borrowings  the average rate paid on fhlb advances decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest on deposits increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we have increased certain interest rates in response to increases in market interest rates and corresponding increases in deposit interest rates offered by our competitors  in order to continue to fund loan growth 
this increase was the result of the deposit campaigns  both for certificates of deposit and core accounts 
a marketing strategy was employed whereby certificates of deposit were offered at premium rates  and the customer was cross sold basic banking products to establish a long term relationship with the customer 
at the same time  a suite of products was offered to high balance customers 
these campaigns served to increase the levels of all deposit types  including non interest bearing demand deposits 
we also issued million of subordinated debentures in march the debentures carry an interest rate equal to the three month libor plus basis points 
the effect of the issue was to increase interest expense by  the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from to net interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was the result of our growth  offset by a compression of our net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the continued period of low market interest rates  combined with intense competition for deposits in our market area 
the provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings and funds the allowance for loan losses 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb inherent losses within the loan portfolio 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  management takes into consideration past and anticipated loss experience  prevailing economic conditions  evaluations of underlying collateral  the nature of the portfolio mix and the balance of non performing and classified loans 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
after thorough review and analysis of the adequacy of the allowance and the continued improvement in asset quality in the loan portfolio  management deemed it prudent to provide  and  for possible loan losses for the year ended december  and  respectively 
non interest income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the decrease can be attributed to a one time sale of impaired loans  which resulted in a gain of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of 
also  contributing to the decrease is the result of the introduction of free checking account products 
in response to competitive pressure  we offered and promoted free checking accounts and realized a significant shift of accounts into this product  resulting in decreased fee income 
service charges on deposit accounts declined  from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  other income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was the result of official check fees  atm and debit card income offset by the decrease of commissions on sales of non deposit investment products 
non interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
salaries and employee benefits increased by  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  salary increases in were offset by increased levels of deferred loan origination costs 
occupancy and equipment expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is a result of cost savings realized from closing branches in that have been offset by costs associated with opening the new assonet branch in april equipment expense increased due to modernization of and investments in teller and platform systems initiatives that we believe will ultimately result in a more efficient customer service 
professional fees increased by  when comparing the years ended december  and the increase is the result of accounting and consulting costs associated with our restatement of certain financial statements and related information totaling  also professional fees increased by  in due to costs associated with the anticipated implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and implementing section for the fdic improvement act of marketing costs increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this is the result of increased advertising and promotional costs associated with our coastal product line and other deposit gathering initiatives 
as we continue to launch new deposit products and services  such as the coastal savings account and the bank at work program  we expect marketing costs to rise 
other expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  income before income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  provision for income taxes totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing overall effective tax rates of and  respectively

this represents a increase in net income from the year ended december   where net income totaled million  or per share basic and per share diluted 
net interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   the direct result of our growth over the year 
commensurate with loan growth  we recognized a provision for loan losses of  in  compared with a credit for loan losses of  in during the past two years  we have made concerted efforts to enhance the credit quality of our loan portfolio  and the credit recorded in was the direct result of that effort 
continuing the dedication to loan quality that management has taken has resulted in a loan loss provision that management believes is in line with its growing loan portfolio 
non interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during the same period  non interest expenses remained relatively constant  increasing from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  income before taxes was million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  interest income increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase can be attributed to the growth in the loan portfolio  as the average balance of loans increased by million or 
the effect of the growth in the portfolio was somewhat offset by lower interest rates on these loans  due to the unprecedented low interest rates that were present in our market area during the yield on the loan portfolio decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  interest and dividends on investments increased by  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   also the result of the growth in the investment portfolio 
the portfolio grew from an average balance of million to million 
income from federal funds sold increased from  to  the result of increased volume of overnight money  particularly when the campaigns for deposit growth were active 
interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   resulting primarily from the increased use of borrowings in the average balance of fhlb advances increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  management took advantage of low interest rates to further grow by funding loan originations or growth in the investment portfolio 
indicative of these low rates  the average rate paid on fhlb advances decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest on deposits increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of the deposit campaigns  both for certificates of deposit and core accounts

these campaigns served to increase the levels of all deposit types  including non interest bearing demand deposits 
we also issued million of subordinated debentures in march the debentures carry an interest rate equal to the three month libor plus basis points 
the effect of the issue was to increase interest expense by  the cost of all interest bearing liabilities rose from to 
net interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was the result of our growth  as the continued period of low market interest rates  combined with intense competition for deposits in our market area  has compressed our net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings and funds the allowance for loan losses 
it is management s desire to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to absorb inherent losses within the loan portfolio 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  management takes into consideration past and anticipated loss experience  prevailing economic conditions  evaluations of underlying collateral  and the volume of the loan portfolio and the balance of non performing and classified loans 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
after thorough review and analysis of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve  the continued improvement in asset quality in the loan portfolio  and the reduction and sale of loans deemed substandard  management deemed it prudent to provide  for loan losses for the year ended december  our credit for loan losses for was  non interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased by  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease of  consists of migration of customers into free checking accounts  a decline in the total number of deposit accounts and a decline in the number of low balance accounts 
cash surrender value of life insurance policies decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  due to the redemption of certain life insurance policies 
the increase in non interest income is attributed to a one time gain on the sale of impaired loans  of  other income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase consisted of an increase on commission sales of non deposit investment products of  in  we changed the third party through whom investment products are sold and in early  added a line of life insurance products to our non deposit investment products 
additionally  electronic banking fees increased by  when comparing the years ended december  and  and a  gain on the sale of fixed assets 
non interest expense remained relatively constant when comparing the years ended december  and  increasing by only  or 
the small magnitude of the change is indicative of management s commitment to expense control 
in and  three branches were closed  and the deposits housed therein were transferred to another branch 
as a result  salaries and employee benefits decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this decrease   was attributed to a decrease in pension expenses  as the expected return on assets increased 
occupancy and equipment expense decreased from million to million over the same period 
professional fees increased by  when comparing the years ended december  and marketing costs increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this is the result of increased advertising and promotional costs associated with our coastal product line and other deposit gathering initiatives 
other expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is primarily the result of a one time expense related to the directors retirement plan  resulting in an increase in the expense of  additionally  computer service fees increased by  because of implementing the cash management and internet banking products

as a result  interest rates have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal sources of funds are customer deposits  amortization and payoff of existing loan principal  and sales or maturities of various investment securities 
the bank is a voluntary member of the federal home loan bank of boston the fhlb and as such  may take advantage of the fhlb s borrowing programs to enhance liquidity and leverage its favorable capital position 
the bank also may draw on lines of credit at the fhlb or the federal reserve board the frb  and enter into repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with authorized brokers 
these various sources of liquidity are used to fund withdrawals  new loans  and investments 
management seeks to promote deposit growth while controlling cost of funds 
sales oriented programs to attract new depositors and the cross selling of various products to its existing customer base are currently in place 
management reviews  on an ongoing basis  possible new products  with particular attention to products and services  which will aid in retaining our base of lower costing deposits 
maturities and sales of investment securities provide us with significant liquidity 
our policy of purchasing shorter term debt securities reduces market risk in the bond portfolio while providing significant cash flow 
for the year ended december   cash flow from maturities of securities was million  proceeds from sales of securities totaled million  compared to maturities of securities of million  and proceeds from sales of securities of million for the year ended december  purchases of securities during and totaled million and million  respectively 
amortization and pay offs of the loan portfolio also provide us with significant liquidity 
traditionally  amortization and pay offs are reinvested into loans 
excess liquidity is invested in federal funds sold and overnight investments at the fhlb 
we have also used borrowed funds as a source of liquidity 
at december   the bank s outstanding borrowings from the fhlb were million 
the bank has the capacity to borrow in excess of million additional at the fhlb 
loan originations for the year ended december  totaled million 
commitments to originate loans at december  were million  excluding unadvanced construction funds totaling million  unadvanced commercial lines of credit totaling million and unadvanced home equity lines totaling million 
management believes that adequate liquidity is available to fund loan commitments utilizing deposits  loan amortization  maturities of securities  or borrowings 
capital resources at december   our total shareholders equity was million  an increase of million from million reported on december  the increase in capital was a combination of several factors 
additions consisted primarily of net income of million for the year ended december  there were  shares issued at a value of  pursuant to the dividend reinvestment program  in lieu of cash dividends or for optional cash contributions and exercised stock options resulted in the issuance of  shares common stock at a value of  including a tax benefit 
these additions were offset by dividends paid of million and accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
under the requirements for risk based and leverage capital of the federal banking agencies  a minimum level of capital will vary among banks based on safety and soundness of operations 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  which include both on and off balance sheet exposure 
in addition to meeting the required levels  slade s ferry bancorp 
s and the bank s capital ratios meet the criteria of the well capitalized category established by the federal banking agencies as of december  and  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk as it could potentially have an effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
the definition of interest rate risk is the exposure of our earnings to adverse movements in interest rates  arising from the differences in the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities  the differences in the various pricing indices inherent in our assets and liabilities  and the effects of overt and embedded options in our assets and liabilities 
our asset liability committee  comprised of executive management  is responsible for managing and monitoring interest rate risk  and reviewing with the board of directors  at least quarterly  the interest rate risk positions  the impact changes in interest rates would have on net interest income  and the maintenance of interest rate risk exposure within approved guidelines 
the potentially volatile nature of market interest rates requires us to manage interest rate risk on an active and dynamic basis 
our objective is to reduce and control the volatility of net interest income to within tolerance levels established by the board of directors  by managing the relationship of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in order to manage this relationship  the asset liability committee utilizes an income simulation model to measure the net interest income at risk under differing interest rate scenarios 
additionally  the committee use economic value of equity eve analysis to measure the effects of changing interest rates on the market values of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  taken as a whole 
the board of directors and management believe that static measures of timing differences  such as gap analysis  do not accurately assess the levels of interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet 
gap analysis does not reflect the effects of overt and embedded options on net interest income  given a shift in interest rates  nor does it take into account basis risk  the risk arising from using various different indices on which to base pricing decisions 
the income simulation model currently utilizes a basis point increase in interest rates and a basis point decrease in rates 
the interest rate movements used assume an instant and parallel change in interest rates and no implementation of any strategic plans are made in response to the change in rates 
prepayment speeds for loans are based on median dealer forecasts for each interest rate scenario 
the board of directors has established a risk limit of a change in net interest income for each basis point shift in market interest rates 
the limit established by the board provides an internal tolerance level to control interest rate risk 
we are within our policy mandated risk limit for net interest income at risk 
the following table reflects our estimated exposure as a percentage of net interest income and the change in basis points for the next twelve months  assuming an immediate change in interest rates set forth below rate change estimated exposure as a percentage change basis points of net interest income basis points additionally we use the model to estimate the effects of changes in interest rates on our eve 
eve represents our theoretical market value  given the rate shocks applied in the model 
the board of directors has established a risk limit for eve which provides that the eve will not fall below  the fdic s minimum capital level to be classified as well capitalized 
we are within our risk limit for eve
