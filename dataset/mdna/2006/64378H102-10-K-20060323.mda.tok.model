critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our critical policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  asset impairment  and inventory valuation including product obsolescence 
we believe that we consistently apply judgments and estimates and such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations and financial conditions 
management believes that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
contractual joint ventures a contractual joint venture is an entity established between the company and another joint venture partner  with the rights and obligations of each party governed by a contract 
if the company owns more than of the joint venture and is able to govern and control its financial and operating policies and its board of directors  such joint venture is considered as a de facto subsidiary and is accounted for as a subsidiary

mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock is an unconditional obligation that must be either redeemed for cash or settled by issuing shares of class a common stock 
the company accounts for preferred stock in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
in connection with the issuance of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  the company incurred professional fees  placement agent fees and associated expenses  which were recorded as deferred financing cost and are being amortized over the term of the preferred stock as interest expense using the effective interest method

stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award 
sfas no 
r was to be effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning on or after june   but in april the sec issued a rule that will permit most registrants to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period as required by sfas no 
r 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r for the fiscal year beginning on december   and recorded the compensation expense for all unvested stock options existing prior to the adoption in the first quarter of recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
in addition  it carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb opinion no 
for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle in most circumstances 
the provisions of sfas are effective in fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to prospectively adopt sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of the idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk the majority of our operations are conducted in the prc except for some minor export business and limited overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in chinese renminbi 
hence  the effect of the fluctuations of exchange rate is considered minimal to our business operations 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in renminbi  which is the official currency of china 
however  we use the united states dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of renminbi  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that renminbi will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of the our net assets and income derived from its operations in the prc 
interest rate risk the company does not have significant interest rate risk  as our debt obligations are primarily short term in nature  with fixed interest rates 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk as most of our customers are long term customers with outstanding payment records 
we monitor our receivable regularly by our credit manager
