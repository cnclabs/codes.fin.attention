item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading less than truckload ltl multi regional motor carrier providing timely one to five day nationwide service among five regions in the united states and next day and second day service within these regions 
historically  over of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy 
in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight this measurement reflects our pricing policies  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth strategies 
generally  freight is rated by a class system  which is established by the national motor freight traffic association  inc light  bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense  heavy freight 
changes in the class  packaging of the freight and length of haul of the shipment can also affect this average 
fuel surcharges  accessorial charges and revenue adjustments are included in this measurement for all periods presented in this annual report 
ltl weight per ltl shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in ltl weight per ltl shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by segmenting our revenue into lengths of haul  we can determine our market share and the growth potential of our service products in those markets 
ltl revenue per ltl shipment this measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used  in conjunction with the number of ltl shipments we receive  to calculate total ltl revenue 
our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  generally referred to as increasing density  thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour and platform pounds per hour 
we believe continued improvement in density is a key component in our ability to sustain profitable growth 
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight  operating supplies and expenses  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 
we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
this technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our systems  while providing key metrics from which we can monitor our processes

average length of haul miles ltl revenue per ltl shipment the growth in revenue we produced in was a primary driver of our financial performance for the year 
for the first time in our history  we achieved revenue over billion while extending a four year trend of producing double digit growth in revenue  net income and diluted earnings per share 
our profitability is due primarily to our focus on growth in existing markets  thereby leveraging our existing infrastructure and capacity 
as a result  we lowered our operating ratio to  increased net income by and increased diluted earnings per share by 
our income and diluted earnings per share before recognizing the cumulative effect of accounting change increased and  respectively  in our revenue growth in was generated through a growth in ltl tonnage and a increase in ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight 
the tonnage growth consists of increases in both ltl shipments and ltl 
table of contents weight per shipment of and  respectively  from we have achieved this growth primarily through expanding our business with existing customers and adding new customers in existing areas  as well as launching new services and improving the quality of our service 
we believe that our continued geographic expansion  as well as increased full state coverage  has positioned us to be attractive to more and more shippers 
additionally  we are able to offer a one source solution to customers regional and inter regional shipping needs by providing these services through one company  in contrast to many of our principal competitors 
for these reasons  combined with a stable economy and industry consolidation during  we have continued to gain market share and increase our revenues 
our average length of haul decreased from in to miles in  reflecting higher growth in our shorter haul regional lanes 
the growth in these shorter haul lanes can be attributed to our evolving customer base  our growing number of states with full state coverage and our focus on building our presence in regional markets 
we believe that our competitiveness in the next day and two day lanes presents us with further growth opportunities  as these are the fastest growing markets in the industry due to the changing demands of shippers 
ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased to from in our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels  which is consistent with industry practice 
this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and was implemented to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel  which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses 
because of the sustained increase in diesel fuel costs  our freight pricing strategy  as well as that in the ltl industry  has evolved and the fuel surcharge is one of many components in the overall price customers are willing to pay for transportation services 
as a result  the fuel surcharge often represents more than just the pass through of increased diesel fuel cost 
because of average higher diesel fuel prices in and the evolution of our freight pricing strategy  the fuel surcharge increased to of revenue from in our fuel surcharge revenue more than offset our increased cost of diesel fuel in a rapid and significant decrease in diesel fuel prices would likely reduce our revenue and operating income until we revised our pricing strategy to reflect these changes 
our pricing has remained relatively stable despite the increased weight per shipment and decreased length of haul  which generally have the effect of reducing revenue per hundredweight 
the overall stability in our pricing demonstrates our ability to maintain our pricing discipline while increasing the volume of freight moving through our service center network 
we increased the total number of service centers in our network to at december  from at december  the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth 
however  the majority of our revenue growth for the years compared was generated from our existing service center network  which has contributed to a increase in revenue per service center in and the continued improvement in our operating ratio 
the revenue growth from geographic expansion typically results in additional freight moving through our existing service center network  which helps to offset higher operating margins that typically accompany new service center openings 
much of the overall improvement in our operating ratio was achieved by the improvement in salaries  wages and benefits as a percent of revenue  which decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in driver wages decreased to of revenue from of revenue in we have continued to see improvement in our linehaul load averages and p d productivity  as reflected by our improvement in revenue per linehaul mile and our improvement in p d shipments handled per hour from we also experienced a similar improvement in platform labor  which decreased to of revenue in from in the prior year 
this improvement primarily resulted from a increase in platform pounds handled per hour 
fringe benefit costs increased to of payroll from in  primarily due to increases in workers compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of we engaged an independent actuary to review our workers compensation and group health self insurance accruals  which resulted in million of additional expense in our fringe benefit costs 

table of contents operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase was primarily due to a increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  resulting from increased diesel fuel prices and a increase in consumption 
we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments  therefore  we are subject to market price fluctuations 
our fuel surcharges  which are generally indexed to the us department of energy s published fuel prices  more than offset the increases in diesel fuel prices during insurance and claims expense  primarily consisting of premiums and self insured costs for auto liability and cargo claims  decreased to of revenue in compared to in we choose to self insure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels 
the improvement in is primarily a result of a reduction in our auto liability expense in the fourth quarter of as a result of an independent actuarial review of our self insured reserve for unpaid claims 
cargo claims expense also decreased slightly in  which we attribute to the increased utilization of adjustable rack systems and reusable inflatable air bags in our trailer fleet  which protect freight from damage caused by load shifting 
new trailer purchases are equipped with these adjustable rack systems and we have retrofitted a portion of our existing trailer fleet 
the significant growth we experienced in required continued investment in real estate and equipment 
additionally  we completed several expansion projects to existing service centers to ensure that our service center network is not a limiting factor to our growth 
as a result  depreciation and amortization decreased only slightly to of revenue in from in in addition  building and office equipment rents remained consistent at of revenue for both and we purchase transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads for linehaul and p d services 
we also contract with lease operators for our container operations and incur short term leases for tractors  trailers and other revenue producing equipment 
we utilize these services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial 
purchased transportation decreased to of revenue in from in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the use of purchased linehaul services  which is due to the increased use of our personnel and equipment 
our continued revenue growth and density improvements have allowed us to successfully leverage our communication and utilities costs along with general supplies and expenses  which when combined  decreased to of revenue in from in interest expense  net of interest income  increased to  for from  for this increase is primarily due to an increased average balance of our long term debt resulting from the two separate issuances of privately placed senior notes under the note purchase agreement entered into on february  our effective tax rate for was compared to in the effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and  to a lesser extent  certain non deductible items

average length of haul miles ltl revenue per ltl shipment 
table of contents in and for the third consecutive year  we achieved double digit growth in revenue  net income and diluted earnings per share 
because our focus in remained primarily on revenue growth in existing markets  we were successful in increasing our operating density and achieved reductions in our operating ratio to from in increased revenue and improved operating efficiency enabled us to achieve a increase in net income and a increase in earnings per share  both in excess of our growth in revenue 
our earnings per share improvement was achieved despite the dilutive effects of our third quarter stock offering  which increased our shares outstanding by 
our revenue growth in was driven primarily by two factors  a growth in ltl tonnage coupled with a increase in ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight 
we believe our tonnage gains are due to overall improvements in the us domestic economy and our ability to attract new customers 
in  ltl weight per ltl shipment increased over we believe the increase in ltl weight per ltl shipment indicates greater demand for our customers products and a resulting increase in overall shipment size and weight 
in addition  we have seen higher year over year growth rates in our customer base that is priced through individual contracts 
revenue based on contractual pricing increased to of our total revenue in compared with in we believe the expansion of our service center network and full state coverage to of those states at year end has positioned us to be attractive to larger customers that ship to and from many regions in the country and seek to reduce their number of core carriers 
our contract customers generally offer larger shipments  which increase our average ltl weight per ltl shipment 
these customers often have a greater length of haul  which is consistent with our average length of haul increase to miles in from miles in ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased to from in our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and is intended to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel  which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses 
because of average higher fuel prices in  the fuel surcharge increased to of revenue from in excluding the fuel surcharge  ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased to from in  reflecting our ability to marginally improve overall pricing in during  we opened new service centers 
in addition to these openings  we improved our direct service capabilities in canada and initiated sales operations in toronto and montreal 
while the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth  these events did not have a significant impact on our annual results 
density  as measured by increases in tonnage and concentrations of shipments moving through our route structure and service center network  generated efficiencies throughout our operations 
as a result  we achieved reductions in salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue  which decreased to in from in driver wages decreased to of revenue in from in we achieved a improvement in p d shipments handled per hour and a increase in our laden load average for the year 
we also experienced a similar reduction in platform labor  which decreased to of revenue in from in our fringe benefit costs increased slightly to of payroll in from in due primarily to increases in holiday  vacation and other paid time off 
operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase was primarily due to a increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  resulting from increased fuel prices and an increase in consumption 
we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments  therefore  we are subject to market price fluctuations 
our fuel surcharges  which decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach established base levels  effectively offset the increases in diesel fuel prices in insurance and claims expense  primarily consisting of premiums and self insured costs for auto liability and cargo claims  increased to of revenue in compared to in we chose to self insure a portion 
table of contents of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels in and while cargo claims liabilities in remained relatively constant with experience  our auto liability claims experience under our retention level increased to of revenue for compared to in the prior year 
this increase is due to both the number and severity of claims that were incurred during and to increases in reserves for claims incurred in prior years 
the focus on revenue growth in existing markets provided opportunities to leverage our investments in property and equipment 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to of revenue in from in in addition  building and office equipment rents decreased to of revenue in from in as a result of greater service center utilization and improved density  our average revenue per service center increased over we utilize purchased transportation services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial 
purchased transportation increased to of revenue in from in  primarily as a result of the increased use of purchased linehaul services  which increased to of revenue in from of revenue in we increased our utilization of these linehaul services in primarily to offset freight imbalances in our longer haul lanes 
our revenue growth and density improvements in allowed us to successfully leverage our communication and utilities costs along with general supplies and expenses  which decreased to of revenue in from in we applied the proceeds of  from our third quarter stock offering to reduce outstanding debt on our credit facility 
at year end  long term debt including current maturities was  compared to  at december   a decrease of  or 
as a result  interest expense for  net of interest income  decreased to  from  in we also capitalized  more interest during than in  which also contributed to the decrease in net interest expense 
our effective tax rate for was compared to in liquidity and capital resources expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities  our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment 
in order to support these requirements  we incurred net capital expenditures of  for the purchase of property and equipment  including those obtained as part of the acquisition of business assets  during cash and cash flows generated internally funded approximately of these combined expenditures 
at december   long term debt including current maturities increased to  from  at december   primarily due to the net proceeds received from the two issuances of privately placed senior notes issued under the note purchase agreement entered into on february  we entered into this note purchase agreement to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  the selected asset purchase from wichita southeast kansas transit  inc and our estimated net capital expenditures not funded by internally generated cash flows 
we estimate capital expenditures  net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions  to be approximately  to  for the year ending december  of our gross capital expenditures  approximately  is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers   is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities  and  is allocated for investments in technology 
the increase in our estimated capital expenditures for is primarily due to planned real estate acquisitions and improvements to increase capacity at our existing service centers  which we believe is necessary in order for us to achieve our growth strategy 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations supplemented by additional borrowings 

table of contents the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment  including those obtained as part of the acquisition of business assets  for the years ended december    and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other proceeds from sale total we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated september  with lenders consisting of wachovia bank  national association  bank of america  na  and branch banking and trust company  with wachovia as agent for the lenders 
this five year facility consists of  in line of credit commitments from the lenders  all of which are available for revolving loans 
in addition  of the  line of credit commitments   may be used for letters of credit and  may be used for borrowings under wachovia s sweep program 
the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of  or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances 
in addition  we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of  in minimum increments of  at our option  revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the higher of wachovia bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum the base rate  b libor one  two  three or six months plus an applicable margin the adjusted libor rate  or c one month libor plus an applicable margin the libor index rate 
the applicable margin varies depending upon our ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in the case of the adjusted libor rate and libor index rate  the applicable margin ranges from to 
the applicable margin under this facility was for the period in effect during revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 
commitment fees ranging from to are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the facility determined by our ratio of debt to total capitalization 
letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 
the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were and  respectively  for the period the facility was in effect during in addition  a facing fee at an annual rate of is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 
the september credit facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
any future wholly owned subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
at december   there was  outstanding on the line of credit facility and there was  of outstanding letters of credit 
the september credit facility replaced our three year  senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated june   as amended  which was terminated on september  we have four senior note agreements outstanding totaling  at december  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities ranging from to  of which  is due in the next twelve months 
interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from to 
the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was and at december  and  respectively

as nominee for prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  umbtru co 
as nominee for security benefit life insurance company  inc and metropolitan life insurance company 
under this agreement  we issued  of privately placed series a senior notes  tranche a on february  and an additional  of privately placed series a senior notes  tranche b on may  collectively  the series a notes 
the series a notes bear an interest rate of and have a maturity date of february  the series a notes call for semi annual interest payments beginning on august  and seven equal annual principal prepayments commencing on february  the proceeds from this agreement were used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
the note purchase agreement may also serve as the platform for potential future private note issuances by the company 
the aggregate principal amount of all notes issued pursuant to the note purchase agreement  including the series a notes  shall not exceed  the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 
our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios 
our credit agreement  which was the most restrictive at december   limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i  ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year  or iii an amount equal to of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in with the exception of the line of credit  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of  at december  we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance  and we believe the combination of our existing credit facilities along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and long term capital needs

other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these critical accounting policies are further described in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract  our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers 
generally  this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment 
for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period 
under this method  we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment s standard delivery time schedule 
this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables  our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers 
actual write offs could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of several factors including changes in the overall economic environment or factors and risks surrounding our customers 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we continually review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts so as to reflect the most recent trends and factors 
we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections  customer allowances  money back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations 
we use historical experience  trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 
management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods 
as such  we do not anticipate any near term changes in our methodologies for these estimates 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated undiscounted cost of claims for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health not covered by insurance 
the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability and group health  which are charged to employee benefits expense 

table of contents insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance between self insurance and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical claims development experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
independent actuarial analyses were performed on these accruals during the fourth quarter of that resulted in an increase to a previous estimate of these reserves of million 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
currently  estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge was implemented to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base 
for the past three years  the net effect of inflation on our results of operations was minimal
