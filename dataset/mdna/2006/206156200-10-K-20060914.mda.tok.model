the image capture market there are three main types of cameras within the amateur image capture market o single use cameras single use cameras are inexpensive  easy to use cameras that are sold preloaded with film and batteries and are designed to be used only once by the consumer 
after use  the consumer returns the entire camera to the photo processor 
the processor then extracts the film and either disposes of the used camera or returns and or sells it for recycling 
o digital cameras digital cameras use an electronic sensor and other components to capture and process an image electronically versus silver halide film  that is then stored within memory 
most digital cameras possess an image review capability that enables instantaneous viewing and or deletion 
in addition  images can be downloaded to a computer for viewing  manipulation  storage  transmission via the internet or printing 
o mm traditional film cameras this category includes all other non single use cameras that use silver halide film 
image capture market trends market trends within the image capture industry include the following o single use cameras according to available third party market research data  after years of robust growth  the single use camera market reached its peak of million units sold worldwide in calendar year total worldwide sales of single use cameras declined to million units in calendar and are projected to decline to million units in calendar we believe  however  that single use cameras remain a large and viable category 
we believe we are currently the third largest producer of single use cameras in the world 
market research source pma digital cameras digital imaging is fast becoming a mature growth industry  and several key markets have already peaked 
according to available third party market research data  japan s digital market peaked in calendar  north america s is projected to peak during calendar and europe s will peak in calendar market research source infotrends the maturation of the japanese  north american and western european digital camera markets will likely set off a chain reaction of other trends  such as an increased number of repeat buyers  the practice of designing and marketing digital cameras for late adopters and an industry vendor shakeout 
a few major manufacturers such as konica minolta  contax and kyocera have already exited the market 
market research source infotrends according to infotrends  calendar worldwide digital camera sales are expected to reach nearly million units  representing a increase over calendar and unit sales are expected to grow until calendar  although most of the growth will come from the asia pacific  eastern europe and latin america regions 
the asia pacific region is expected to become the leading region for sales of digital cameras by calendar in the us market  digital camera sales reached million units in calendar  up from the previous year 
digital cameras sales in calendar are expected to be only modestly higher than in calendar before declining for the first time in calendar as penetration of digital cameras reaches half of us households and replacement cycles of higher resolution cameras by consumers continue to lengthen 
mm traditional film cameras mm traditional film cameras are being displaced by digital cameras 
in the us market  digital cameras began to outsell film cameras in the past two years 
the calendar film camera sales in the united states were reported at million units  a decrease from the previous year 
the decline is expected to continue in calendar  with sales projected at million units  which represents about a decrease in sales 
the contribution of film cameras to the total sales mix of image capture products in the us was just in calendar and is expected to be about by calendar two significant market participants previously announced their withdrawal from the film camera market nikon with the exception of two slr models and konica minolta 
in response to the declining market for mm traditional film cameras  in fiscal  we reduced our standard product range and focused our sales effort on three key models motorized  auto focus and zoom cameras 
these three models provide the features that suit different consumers needs at affordable retail prices below based on the image capture market trends discussed above  we believe that the market for single use cameras is the most viable for our company 
as a result  we are focusing on increasing our sales of single use cameras through various sales and marketing initiatives and the development of new single use camera designs and products with lower costs  improved performance  enhanced quality  greater consumer appeal and new features 
image capture products our products include single use  digital and mm traditional film cameras 
we sell private label and brand name products to our rsd customers worldwide either directly or through third party distributors 
we design  develop and manufacture most of our single use cameras and certain of our mm traditional film cameras and outsource the manufacture of our digital cameras and certain of our single use and mm traditional film cameras 
we offer a complete line of single use cameras  including outdoor  flash  auto wind and underwater models 
we believe that we are uniquely structured to provide encasements  finishes and packaging to accommodate different user and customer preferences 
our digital cameras include resolutions ranging from video graphics array vga up to and including megapixels 
we have de emphasized  and are continuing to significantly de emphasize  the sale of digital cameras 
our mm traditional film cameras range from entry level to fully featured zoom models and include models used by certain rsd customers to support special promotion and loyalty programs offered to their customers 
our expenditures for product design and development decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we expect design and product development expense to continue to decrease as a result of our de emphasis of digital camera sales 
for additional information regarding product development costs  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing of image capture products we sell to retailers on a worldwide basis through offices and or representatives in the americas  united kingdom  germany and france europe  and hong kong  china and japan asia 
we currently market our products to retailers on a private label basis and or under the following brand names o concord o easyshot o fun shooter o jenoptik o keystone o le clic o polaroid we have established our presence with our retail customers by offering attractive  easy to use and popularly priced single use  digital and mm traditional film cameras 
we market many different styles of cameras that are sold through thousands of retail outlets 
we have in house sales and marketing personnel who make the majority of our direct sales to our customers 
we also have independent sales representatives who serve specific geographic areas 
sales representatives generally receive commissions ranging from to of net sales to retail customers  depending on the type of customer and product  and may act as sales representatives for manufacturers of other photographic and non photographic products 
we also sell products to distributors on a wholesale basis who  in turn  sell our products to retailers 
competition in the image capture market the image capture industry is highly competitive with many companies marketing products to the retail market 
as a producer and or marketer of popularly priced image capture products  we encounter substantial competition from a number of companies  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets and brand recognition  and more extensive research  development and manufacturing capabilities than we have 
our key competitors in the single use camera market are fuji and kodak both of whom have greater resources than we have or may reasonably be expected to have in the foreseeable future 
maintaining a competitive advantage depends on our ability to develop and manufacture or purchase from outsourced manufacturers high quality products at the lowest cost 
backlog due to the lead time required for production and shipping and the need to build inventory to meet seasonal demand  we may at times have a backlog of orders for products 
we define backlog as unfulfilled orders supported by signed contracts or purchase orders for delivery of our products generally within the next six months 
our backlog at july  was approximately million 
we experience fluctuations in our backlog at various times during our fiscal year 
we expect that approximately million of the unfulfilled orders at july  will be shipped during the first quarter of fiscal although we believe that our entire backlog consists of firm orders  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual revenue for any future period because of the possibility of customer cancellations  order changes  changes in delivery schedules and delays inherent in the shipments of products 
no assurance can be given that the current backlog will necessarily lead to revenue in any specific future period 
major customers in fiscal  we had two retail customers  each of whose purchases represented in excess of of our total net sales wal mart stores  inc wal mart represented of total net sales  and ii walgreen co 
walgreens represented of total net sales 
during fiscal  there were no sales to kodak  which was a significant customer of ours during the first two quarters of fiscal kodak stopped purchasing single use cameras under its two dms contracts with us in december  which had a material adverse effect on results of operations 
see note  geographic area and significant customer information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality sales of our products are linked to the timing of vacations  holidays and other leisure activities 
sales are normally strongest in the first and second quarters summer  fall and early winter of our fiscal year when demand is high as retailers prepare for the holiday season 
sales are also strong in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year spring to early summer due to demand driven by heavy vacation activity and events such as weddings and graduations 
sales are normally lowest in the third quarter of our fiscal year winter to early spring with the absence of holidays and fewer people taking vacations 
licensing activities we have a worldwide non exclusive license which excluded japan until january  to use certain of the single use camera patents and patent applications of fuji photo film ltd 
fuji in connection with the manufacture  remanufacture and sale of single use cameras 
the license extends until the later of february  or the expiration of the last of the licensed fuji patents and provides for payment of a license fee and certain royalty payments to fuji 
our ability to manufacture and sell single use cameras depends on the continuation of our right to use the fuji patents 
as a result  the loss of the fuji license prior to the expiration of the patents could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation 
we have the worldwide  exclusive right to use the polaroid corporation polaroid brand trademark in connection with the manufacture  distribution  promotion and sale of single use and traditional film based cameras  including zoom cameras and certain related accessories but excluding instant and digital cameras  except for products released by polaroid into the distribution chain before august  the single use camera license agreement expires on february  and provides for the payment of million of minimum royalties to polaroid  which will be fully credited against percentage royalties 
the traditional film camera license agreement expires on january  and provides for a minimum royalty payment of  to polaroid on or before october   which will be fully credited against percentage royalties during the first year of the term 
there are no minimum guaranteed royalty payments under the traditional film camera license agreement after the first year of the term 
as of july   our mm traditional film percentage royalties exceeded the minimum royalty amount 
we believe that the loss of the polaroid license would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
as part of our acquisition of jenimage europe gmbh jenimage in  we entered into a twenty year  worldwide trademark license agreement with jenoptik ag for the exclusive use of the jenoptik brand name and trademark on non professional consumer imaging products including  but not limited to  digital  single use and traditional film cameras  and other imaging products and related accessories 
the license does not contain any minimum guaranteed royalty payments

our manufacturing and related dormitory facilities in the prc occupy approximately  square feet 
see item  properties  for information on the leases and land use agreements related to our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
our prc manufacturing facilities have been certified under the social accountability standard sa since november the sa is an international standard designed to ensure safe working conditions  fair management practices and the protection of workers rights 
our prc manufacturing facilities are iso and accredited 
equipment  components  raw materials and products from outsourced manufacturers we own the tools and equipment necessary to manufacture a significant number of our single use camera products and components used in our single use camera products 
manufacturers and suppliers located in the far east and other parts of the world supply us with raw materials  components and finished products that we do not manufacture 
in fiscal  we did not purchase components relating to the manufacture of digital and mm traditional film cameras as a result of our decision to outsource the manufacture of these products 
prc operations our operations are substantially dependent upon our manufacturing and assembly activities in the prc 
our current processing agreement with the prc governmental entities  which allows us to operate in the prc  expires in october we have entered into a new processing agreement that will allow us to continue to operate in the prc until october the new processing agreement is pending approval by the applicable prc governmental entities 
see item  properties  for information on the leases and land use agreements related to our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
we expect to continue manufacturing in the prc after october either under the recently executed processing agreement that is pending prc governmental approval or pursuant to some other form of legal authorization 
in  we established  registered and commenced operations of a wholly foreign owned enterprise  concord camera shenzhen company limited concord shenzhen  pursuant to the laws of the prc relating to enterprises with a sole foreign investor 
the business license of concord shenzhen  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of concord camera hk limited cchk  permits it to design  develop  manufacture and sell single use  mm traditional film and digital cameras and camera components in the prc and worldwide on both a retail and wholesale basis

we also license the jenoptik trademark for exclusive use worldwide for non professional consumer imaging products and accessories both digital and film based 
we own numerous patents  some of which are used in our current products 
we have applied for  and will continue to apply for  in the united states and foreign countries  patents to protect the inventions and technologies developed by or for us 
we do not believe our competitiveness and market share are dependent on the ultimate disposition of our patent applications 
we license patents and patent applications related to single use cameras from fuji in connection with the manufacture and sale of single use cameras 
see licensing activities above 
new business initiatives during fiscal  we initiated a process to identify  assess  quantify and define new business areas capable of helping our company regain momentum and build a profitable business on a sustainable basis 
we evaluated  and continue to evaluate  opportunities based on their industry attractiveness  competitive dynamics  channel compatibility and potential for providing a profitable business model 
we conducted quantitative and qualitative research  during which we exposed various target audiences to our product concepts and tested purchase intent  channel preference and price sensitivity 
we have also conducted limited market testing to evaluate certain product concepts 
the product concepts include both photographic and non photographic products 
employee relations as of august   we had employees  of whom  or were located in hong kong   or  were located in europe and  or  were located in the americas 
we currently have one collective bargaining agreement covering six employees in france that has no stated expiration date 
during fiscal  pursuant to our agreements with prc governmental entities  and based upon production demand  approximately  to  people worked in our prc manufacturing facilities 
we believe that our relationship with our employees and workers is satisfactory 
financial information about geographic areas for financial information about geographic areas  see note  geographic area and significant customer information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in item a  risks factors  below 
item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks regarding our company 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report 
our internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to detect in a timely manner misstatements that could occur in our financial statements in amounts that may be material 
as of july   we identified ten material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
for a discussion of our remediation efforts  see item a  controls and procedures  below and the periodic reports that we previously filed with the sec 
although we believe that at least seven of the previously identified material weaknesses were remediated as of july   we are still experiencing material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in connection with our enterprise resource planning erp system  our information technology and our sales  accounts receivable and revenue recognition processes 
we anticipate that these remaining three material weaknesses will be remediated during fiscal we cannot assure you  however  that our remediation efforts will be successful within this time frame or at all 
we may also continue to experience significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future  which  if not remediated  may render us unable to detect in a timely manner misstatements that could occur in our financial statements in amounts that may be material 
the implementation of our new erp system in early fiscal continues to represent a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
during august  we converted from our existing legacy systems to a new erp system 
this design and implementation project began in july and includes our accounting  financial and operating functions and systems  including sales  supply chain and manufacturing systems 
implementing the erp system involved significant costs  in terms of both the financial and human resources incurred and expended 
as disclosed in this report and in earlier reports filed with the sec  the ineffective planning and implementation of the erp system constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not yet successfully remediated 
see item a  controls and procedures  below 
the remediation effort associated with this material weakness continues to involve significant costs  in terms of both the financial and human resources incurred and expended 
although we believe the material weakness with respect to the erp system will be remediated during fiscal  if we are unsuccessful in remediating this material weakness  our reliance on the erp system could interfere with our ability to file our periodic reports with the sec on a timely basis and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to manage our business 
we may not continue to meet nasdaq listing standards 
under nasdaq continued listing standard one rule a  companies listed on the nasdaq global market are required to have  among other criteria  a minimum per share price of at least 
a company may be de listed from the nasdaq global market if its common stock trades below per share for consecutive business days and  after receiving a deficiency notice from nasdaq  does not maintain a minimum bid price of at least for consecutive trading days within a period of days from the date of such notice 
as disclosed in the current report on form k that we filed with the sec on june   on june   we received a deficiency letter from the nasdaq staff indicating that for consecutive days  the per share price of our common stock closed below the minimum per share requirement 
nasdaq has provided us a period of calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum per share price requirement 
the compliance period will expire on december  if our common stock does not achieve compliance with the minimum per share price requirement within this period  nasdaq will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be de listed 
if our common stock is de listed from nasdaq  we will face a significant reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a material reduction in the per share price of our common stock 
in addition  any such de listing could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and may result in the loss of confidence in our financial stability by suppliers  customers and employees 
if our securities are de listed from the nasdaq global market  we may face a lengthy process to re list our securities  if we are able to re list them at all  and the liquidity that nasdaq provides will no longer be available to investors 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to regain and maintain compliance with the per share minimum price requirement for continued listing on nasdaq or that our stock will not be de listed by nasdaq 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate and or continue to decline 
the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of such companies 
these broad market movements may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in many instances  securities class action litigation has been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
such litigations have been instituted against us and could continue to result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
see item  legal proceedings  below and note  litigation and settlements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the expiration of our processing agreement with the prc would disrupt our operations 
our operations are substantially dependent upon our ability to manufacture and assemble our products in the prc 
our current processing agreement with the prc governmental entities  which allows us to operate in the prc  expires in october we have entered into a new processing agreement which will allow us to continue to operate in the prc until october the new processing agreement is pending approval by the applicable prc governmental entities 
if the new processing agreement is not approved or we cannot enter into an alternative arrangement that will permit us to continue to operate in the prc under similar terms and conditions  our results of operations and our ability to carry on our business would be materially adversely affected 
we may experience liquidity issues if our reliance on financing facilities increases 
our primary source of liquidity has been provided by our short term investments  funds provided by the collection of accounts receivable and borrowing availability under our financing facilities 
our borrowing capacity under the import facility provided by the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited hsbc was reduced during calendar year from million in january to million in september in january  the hsbc financing facilities were further reduced to an aggregate of approximately million and we were required to provide cash deposits pledged as security in the amount of approximately million against the facility 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  hong kong financing facilities  for additional information on the hsbc financing facilities 
due to our recent losses  we may need to increase our reliance on financing facilities  whether through hsbc or other financial institutions and  as a result  we may face liquidity issues due to potential funding limits and debt service requirements imposed by lenders 
additionally  we may not be able to secure such financing on reasonable terms or at all 
a significant increase in our indebtedness could increase our financing costs  interfere with our ability to operate our business effectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business strategies may not succeed 
during the normal course of our business  we evaluate  develop and implement various short term and long term business strategies such as our restructuring initiatives and cost reduction initiatives discussed in part ii  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these strategies required  and may continue to require  significant financial and human resources 
there can be no assurance that any such strategies  if implemented  will be successful 
the failure of such strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be successful in implementing our restructuring initiatives and cost reduction initiatives 
in december  we implemented restructuring initiatives that  among other things  were designed to eliminate our reliance on internally designed and manufactured digital cameras and increase the design  co development and purchase of digital cameras from outsourced manufacturers 
in fiscal and fiscal  we incurred significant restructuring charges and expenses as a result of the restructuring initiatives and may incur additional charges 
in addition  as a result of our continued evaluation of our cost structure and the on going strategic review process  we reduced certain costs including  among other things  employee costs as a result of our eliminating certain employee positions and consolidating certain of our operations in europe 
the expected benefits from these initiatives are subject to many estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  assumptions regarding i the amount and timing of cost reductions we can achieve  ii our ability to develop and maintain relationships with outsourced manufacturers for the design  co development and purchase of our products  iii our ability to meet customer demands and fulfill customer service obligations  and iv the costs and timing of activities undertaken in connection with these initiatives 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic  competitive and other uncertainties that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
if these assumptions are not realized  or if other unforeseen events occur  the initiatives may not be successful and our results of operations and our ability to compete could be adversely affected 
see note  restructuring and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we continue to incur substantial losses  we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs 
although we believe that we have sufficient working capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  our ability to fund our operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital and liquidity may be impaired if we continue to incur losses  fail to generate substantial growth in sales of our products or fail to control operating expenses 
if we require funding to meet our cash flow needs  we may seek to obtain such funding through  among other things  loans or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or by issuing debt that is convertible into equity  existing shareholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage 
moreover  additional funding or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we face significant risks related to the single use  digital and mm traditional film camera markets 
based upon available third party market research data  the digital camera market peaked in japan in calendar and is projected to peak in north america during calendar and will peak in europe in calendar  the mm traditional film camera market has been in significant decline and is expected to continue to decline  and the single use camera market is in decline 
see item  business  image capture market trends  above 
as discussed in this report  we have de emphasized sales of our digital camera products and are concentrating on increasing sales of our single use camera products 
there is no assurance  however  that our single use camera sales will increase  or that  even if they do increase  they will be profitable or that we will be able to maintain our market share in the single use and mm traditional film camera markets 
we are dependent on a small number of customers 
we have a small number of customers that represent a high percentage of our revenues 
our products are sold in very competitive markets 
our competitors may adopt more aggressive policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  which could result in a loss of sales or of customers 
the loss of sales or of one or more of these important customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the camera and photographic products industry is highly competitive 
as a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of low cost  popularly priced image capture products  we encounter intense competition from a number of companies  including without limitation  canon  fuji  hewlett packard  kodak  olympus  nikon  sony  pentax  panasonic  samsung and vivitar  each of which has or may have longer operating histories  more established markets  better brand recognition  more extensive facilities and  in some cases  greater resources than we have 
maintaining a competitive advantage against our competitors depends on our ability to develop and manufacture or purchase from outsourced manufacturers high quality products at the lowest cost and our ability to market and sell cameras profitably 
these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes  price reductions  and or increased operating costs  such as for marketing and sales incentives  resulting in lower revenues  gross margins and income 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion  obsolescence and higher rates of returns and allowances 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion  rapid obsolescence and rates of returns and allowances to a greater extent than mm traditional film and single use camera products 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we sell more units  and our gross profits and margins decline unless we are able to reduce our product costs by commensurate amounts and percentages or find new customers 
to be successful in the market  we have to respond quickly to technological advances and market conditions and manage our inventory effectively to accommodate price declines and erosion resulting from such factors as competition and the short life span of such products 
due to price competition  allowances for digital cameras are considerably higher than those provided to customers for traditional and single use cameras 
these uncertainties  individually or in the aggregate  have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our gross profits and profit margins and  as a result  as discussed in this report  we have de emphasized sales of our digital camera products 
we depend on third party suppliers  and our revenue  gross profits and margins could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly 
we currently purchase all of our digital and certain of our single use and mm traditional film camera products from outsourced manufacturers for sale to our rsd customers worldwide 
our manufacturing  sales and distribution operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products and our suppliers ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components and products at reasonable prices in time to meet critical manufacturing  sales and distribution schedules 
given the variety of products that we offer  the large number of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe and the long lead times that are required to manufacture  assemble and deliver certain components and products  adverse circumstances  issues and problems could arise in planning production  procurement and managing inventory levels that could negatively impact our business and increase our financial exposure and risk 
other supplier problems that we could face include component and product shortages  excess supply and risks related to fixed price contracts that would require us to pay more than the open market price  as more fully described below 
o supply shortages 
we may experience a short supply of  or a delay in receiving  certain components and products as a result of strong demand  capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these components and products may increase  we may be exposed to quality issues or the components and products may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough components and or products at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build  sell and distribute new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed 
accordingly  our revenue  gross profits and margins could suffer as we could lose time sensitive sales  incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers 
if we cannot adequately address supply issues  we may have to re engineer and or source some components and products  resulting in further costs and delays 
o oversupply 
in order to secure products or components for the production of products  at times we may make advance payments to suppliers  or we may enter into non cancelable commitments with suppliers 
if we fail to properly anticipate customer demand  an oversupply of products and or components could result in excess or obsolete inventory 
this excess or obsolete inventory may result in lowering the carrying value of these components and or products by recording an inventory charge which could adversely affect our gross profits and margins 
o long term pricing commitments 
as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers  we may be obligated to purchase components and or products at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions 
in the event that we become committed to purchase components and or products for prices in excess of the current market price  we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components and or products at lower prices 
this excess over current market price may result in lowering the carrying value of those components and or products by recording an inventory charge that could adversely affect our gross profits and margins 
in many instances  we rely on offshore suppliers  including  but not limited to  manufacturers in the prc  for the production of cameras and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture 
regional economic  business  environmental  political  medical or military conditions or events could disrupt supplies in foreign locations 
we ceased manufacturing digital cameras at the end of fiscal we began purchasing digital camera products exclusively from outsourced manufacturers in the first quarter of fiscal the risks identified above will continue to be significant as a result of our purchases of products from these manufacturers 
we are dependent on third party service providers to provide distribution facilities for all of our operations in the united states  latin america and europe 
the warehousing and distribution services for our i united states and latin american operations are handled from a single distribution facility operated by a third party service provider in san pedro  california  and ii european operations are handled from a single distribution facility operated by a third party service provider in moerdijk  the netherlands 
our products are prepared for shipment and shipped to our customers by such third party service providers at these distribution facilities 
any failure by these third party service providers to maintain a regular flow of products from us to our customers or any significant interruption in the business of these service providers or the operation of these distribution facilities due to natural disasters  accidents  system failures  work stoppages or other causes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  if the cost of these services increases  our gross profits and margins could suffer 
most of our operations in the prc are subject to regulation by local governmental agencies 
the continuing viability of our prc agreements is critical to our business operations 
we manufacture a large number of the components used in our cameras and assemble all of our own manufactured finished products at our facilities in the prc 
during fiscal  based upon production demand  we had approximately  to  workers at our manufacturing facilities in the prc either employed by our prc subsidiary or provided through our agreements with various prc government or quasi government entities 
we are responsible for their wages  food and housing and must comply with a variety of local labor and employee benefit laws covering these workers 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws as currently enforced  these laws are subject to modification and interpretation by local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict the effect of any future modifications to or strict enforcement of the existing laws 
in addition  the termination or material modification of any of our agreements with the prc governmental or quasi government entities could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with sales to our customers 
we sell a significant number of products to a small number of customers 
receivables arising from these sales are generally not collateralized 
we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and review outstanding receivable balances for collectibility on a regular basis and record provisions for doubtful accounts  allowances and returns  as necessary 
in the past  we have had customers file for protection from their creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we have recognized provisions related to accounts receivable and inventory 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 
if we are unable to collect or timely collect outstanding receivables from our customers or our customers seek protection from their creditors under the bankruptcy code or applicable foreign bankruptcy regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to risks associated with intellectual property used in our products 
our products use technology which may be protected by united states or foreign patents 
the right to use such intellectual property is subject to the availability of licenses from the owners of the intellectual property 
if licenses are not available  or are only available on onerous terms  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
third parties also may claim that we  or the customers we indemnify  are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we believe that the claims are without merit  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also may require us to redesign affected products  enter into costly settlement or license agreements  pay costly damage awards or cease marketing of certain products subject to the claims 
even if we have an agreement with a third party to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source  our operations could suffer 
from time to time  we receive patent infringement claims which we analyze and  if appropriate  take action to avoid infringement  settle the claim or negotiate a license 
those claims for which legal proceedings have been initiated against us are discussed in item  legal proceedings  and in note  litigation and settlements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also received notifications from two entities  one of which was a significant customer  alleging that certain of our digital cameras infringe upon those entities respective patents 
we are engaged in discussions with these entities regarding resolution of the claims 
based on our initial assessment of these two claims  infringement of one or more patents is probable if the patents are valid 
based upon the licensing discussions to date  we preliminarily estimate the potential royalties due to these two claimants for digital camera sales through july  to be between and approximately million in the aggregate 
the actual royalty amounts  if any  for past and future sales are dependent upon the outcome of the negotiations 
we have notified certain of our suppliers of our right to be indemnified by the suppliers in the event we are required to pay royalties or damages to either claimant 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the potential loss  if any  within the range of estimates relating to these claims 
accordingly  no amounts have been accrued related to these claims as of july  our ability to manufacture and sell single use cameras depends on our licensing agreement with fuji 
our business is substantially dependent on our license from fuji  which granted us a worldwide non exclusive right to use certain fuji patents and patent applications related to single use cameras 
the license extends until the later of the expiration of the last of the licensed fuji patents or february  after the term of the license expires  we expect to continue to be able to manufacture and sell single use cameras without a license 
if  however  the license is terminated prior to the expiration of the patents  we may not be able to continue to manufacture and sell single use cameras and  as a result  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to political  economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 
we have significant operations outside the united states 
we currently have operations in the americas  europe and asia 
further  we obtain raw materials  components and finished camera products from foreign suppliers  particularly in asia 
accordingly  our business is subject to the political  economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries 
these risks include  but are not limited to o the difficulty of enforcing agreements  collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems  o trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  o the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  o difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations  o required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  o changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  particularly in emerging markets  and o increased costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
our business depends in part on our ability to successfully anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
relocation time and expenses could result in substantial losses 
if we determine it is necessary to relocate our manufacturing facilities from the prc  or to another location within the prc  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes  governmental restrictions or for other regulatory  business and or financial reasons  we would incur substantial operating and capital losses  including losses resulting from business interruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of our manufacturing equipment and other assets  we may incur relatively higher manufacturing costs  which could reduce sales and decrease the gross profits and margins on the products we manufacture 
relocation of our manufacturing operations could also result in disruption in the delivery of our products  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products in the future 
we are exposed to interest rate and exchange rate risk 
as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
exchange rates and interest rates in certain markets in which we do business tend to be more volatile than those in the united states and western europe 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency and our products may be less competitive in that country 
we generally do not engage in currency hedging activities 
the prc government announced on july  that its currency will no longer be pegged to the us dollar 
instead  the exchange rates for the chinese yuan  or renminbi  will be determined by a basket of foreign currencies 
this change effected a de facto revaluation of the yuan to the us dollar from yuan to yuan per us dollar 
currently  we generate nominal net sales valued in renminbi 
net sales recorded in hong kong are denominated in hong kong dollars  the exchange rate of which has not been affected by the yuan revaluation and is still pegged to the us dollar 
we expect that the revaluation may initially have an immaterial negative effect on our manufacturing operations in the prc by immaterially increasing our cost of doing business in the prc 
the interest rate related to our hong kong financing facilities provided by hsbc is based on a spread over the hong kong interbank offered rate on import loans denominated in hong kong dollars and over the singapore interbank offered rate on import loans denominated in other currencies 
a significant change in these rates could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  we are not utilizing any interest rate protection agreements to limit our exposure to this risk 
we are dependent on a small group of key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
the loss of key management and operating personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategies  or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than currently budgeted and or anticipated in the future 
our inability to attract and retain such personnel could limit our growth and affect our results of operations 
international trade restrictions could adversely affect our business and growth 
the united states  the prc  hong kong  the european union or other countries where we do business may impose trade restrictions that could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the united states is currently monitoring various prc practices  including trade  investment and government procurement  as well as the prc s compliance with various multilateral and bilateral agreements 
we cannot predict whether the united states will take future trade actions against the prc that may result in increased tariffs against prc products  including products that we import 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events 
disasters such as hurricanes  typhoons  earthquakes  or other acts of nature  terrorist attacks  fire  water or electricity failure  or accidents affecting our operating activities  facilities  and employees and customers health could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  our operations in the prc  as well as most of our outsourced manufacturers  suppliers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of components and products are located within a relatively close proximity of one another in the prc 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could disrupt our business and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in the event of another outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or some other disease or health related issue  our facilities and or the facilities of our outsourced manufacturers  suppliers and service providers located in hong kong  the prc and other parts of the world could be quarantined  temporarily closed or disrupted 
if such an outbreak occurs  it could delay or prevent us from developing new products or manufacturing  testing or shipping our current or future products  and may require us to find other providers of such services and or products  which may be unavailable or more expensive 
further  if a sars outbreak has an adverse impact on the businesses of our customers  it could reduce the size and or frequency of our customers purchases  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
our future income tax rates could increase 
a number of factors will affect our income tax rate in the future  and the combined effect of these factors could result in an increase in our effective income tax rate as compared to our effective income tax rate in fiscal this potential increase in future effective income tax rates would adversely affect net income in future periods 
we operate in different countries that have different income tax rates 
based upon our apportionment of income  our effective income tax rate could fluctuate 
changes in income tax laws in the united states or countries where we presently have operations may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to identify and integrate future acquisitions 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions that we consider reasonable in light of the revenues and the results of operations we believe we will be able to achieve from these acquisitions  once combined and integrated with us 
the cost of acquisitions within the industry has generally increased over time 
additionally  we compete for acquisitions with certain other industry competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than us 
increased demand for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices 
although we believe opportunities may exist for us to grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
if we do acquire another company or companies  we may not be able to profitably manage and successfully integrate the acquired company or companies with our operations  sales and marketing efforts without substantial costs or delays 
acquisitions involve a number of potential risks  including the potential loss of customers and contracts  increased leverage and debt service requirements  combining disparate company cultures and facilities and operating in geographically diverse markets 
an inability to identify and or integrate future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see item a  risk factors  for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we market and sell popularly priced  easy to use image capture products including single use  digital and mm traditional film cameras 
we design  develop  manufacture and assemble most of our single use cameras and certain of our mm traditional film cameras at our manufacturing facilities in the prc and outsource the manufacture of digital cameras and certain of our single use and mm traditional film cameras 
in fiscal and fiscal  we de emphasized the sale of digital cameras and we do not expect digital camera sales to be material in fiscal we sell our private label and brand name products to our rsd customers worldwide either directly or through third party distributors 
during fiscal  our dms sales of single use cameras declined primarily as a result of the decision of kodak to cease purchases under its two dms contracts with us 
although we continue to seek and evaluate dms business opportunities  there were no dms sales during fiscal executive summary year over year results of operations our operating loss in fiscal was million as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal significant factors contributing to the year over year reduction of our operating loss were lower product design and manufacturing labor and overhead costs  lower digital camera and component inventory charges  lower selling  general and administrative expenses  and lower restructuring and other charges 
lower product design and manufacturing labor and overhead costs as a result of the restructuring initiatives implemented in fiscal designed to eliminate our reliance on internally designed and manufactured digital cameras and to increase reliance on the outsourced manufacture of digital cameras  we significantly reduced our product design costs and manufacturing labor and overhead costs 
as compared to fiscal  these manufacturing related cost reductions  together with increased efficiencies and production volumes related to the manufacture of single use cameras  resulted in a decrease in product design costs and reduced under absorption of manufacturing labor and overhead in fiscal in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
these reductions in product design costs and under absorption of manufacturing labor and overhead costs resulted in a total reduction of million in our year over year operating loss 
lower digital camera and component inventory charges we continued to experience significant competition and price declines in the digital camera market in fiscal the inventory charges recorded for fiscal were million as compared to million recorded in fiscal in fiscal  this reduction in inventory charges was primarily due to a significant reduction in our digital raw materials  components  work in process and finished goods inventory levels resulting from our increased reliance on the outsourced manufacture of digital cameras  de emphasis of the sale of digital cameras and improved inventory management processes 
this fiscal reduction in inventory charges contributed million to the reduction of our year over year operating loss 
lower selling and general and administrative expenses as a result of our restructuring initiatives and cost reduction initiatives discussed below and in note  restructuring and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we realized the benefits of lower selling  general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in professional fees  marketing activities  personnel and freight related costs 
lower net restructuring and other charges the restructuring initiatives implemented in fiscal resulted in significant costs for restructuring and other charges 
during fiscal  we incurred restructuring charges of million related to employee severance and million related to inventory impairment 
we also recorded an additional million in depreciation expense related to the reduction in the useful lives of the molds and tooling formerly used in the manufacture of digital cameras 
in addition to the restructuring charges  during fiscal  we incurred other charges of million related to employee severance as part of the consolidation of operations in europe 
during fiscal  we incurred other charges of million related to employee severance and retention resulting from our de emphasizing digital cameras sales in europe and further consolidation of our european operations 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges in fiscal totaling million related to the impairment of certain long lived assets 
as compared to fiscal  restructuring costs decreased by million in fiscal  whereas other charges increased by million  which in total contributed to a net reduction of million to the year over year operating loss 
fiscal results of operations although we significantly reduced our operating loss by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  we still recorded an operating loss of million during fiscal factors contributing to the fiscal operating loss were negative gross profit margins on sales of digital cameras  operating expenses related to the sale of digital cameras  and other charges professional fees related to internal control compliance negative gross profit margins on sales of digital cameras although we outsourced the manufacture of digital cameras during fiscal  we continue to experience significant competitive pricing pressures that resulted in negative gross profit margins on sales of digital cameras 
in addition  we did not realize a gross profit on the sales of digital cameras whose carrying values were lowered in prior periods 
since we lowered the carrying value of certain digital camera inventory  sales of such digital camera inventory in future periods will result  on average  in a nominal gross profit margin 
operating expenses related to sales of digital cameras during fiscal  we incurred significant operating expenses  mainly in europe  related to sales of digital cameras 
as we implement our operating strategy that includes a realignment of our operations in europe designed to significantly de emphasize the sale of digital cameras and increase our focus on the sales of single use and mm traditional film cameras  we anticipate our future operating expenses in europe to be significantly lower 
other charges during fiscal  we recorded other charges totaling million related to long lived asset impairment million and severance and retention costs million 
see restructuring and other charges  below for further information regarding the nature of the charges 
professional fees related to internal control compliance we incurred professional fees of million primarily related to compliance measures under section although we have significantly increased our gross profit margin and lowered our costs  as a result of our increased emphasis on the sale of single use and  to a lesser extent  mm traditional film cameras  our fiscal sales and gross profit margins were not sufficient to cover our gross deficit on the sale of digital cameras and related operating expenses 
due to the pricing pressures in the digital camera market and the previous write downs of our digital camera inventory  we have  however  not been able to achieve positive gross profit margins on our sale of digital cameras 
in light of these trends  we continue to take action and to review our strategies  including and relating to i acquisition of new single use and mm traditional film camera customers  ii continued de emphasis of digital camera sales and reduction of related operating expenses  iii implementation of additional cost reductions  and iv potential new business initiatives 
there can be no assurances that implementing any such strategies will successfully reverse our losses  increase our revenues  decrease our costs or improve our results of operations 
see item  business  for more information regarding our new business initiatives 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our application of accounting policies affects these estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition corrected copy  when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and collectibility is probable 
title and risk of loss generally transfer when the product is delivered to the customer or upon shipment  depending upon negotiated contractual arrangements 
sales are recorded net of anticipated returns which we estimate based on historical rates of return  adjusted for current events as appropriate  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas no 

if actual future returns are higher than estimated  then net sales could be adversely affected 
management has assessed the appropriateness of the timing of revenue recognition in accordance with sfas no 
after considering the requirements of sfas no 
 we concluded we would defer recognition of revenue from certain customers until such customers transactions meet all of the requirements of sfas no 
we may enter into arrangements to offer certain pricing discounts and allowances that do not provide an identifiable separate benefit or service or may enter into arrangements to provide certain free products 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  we record the pricing discounts and allowances as a reduction of sales and record the cost of free products ratably into cost of products sold based upon the underlying revenue transaction 
sales returns we establish a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical product return trends 
if the actual future returns are higher than we originally estimated  which we based upon historical data  our net sales could be adversely affected 
provision for doubtful accounts we base the provision for doubtful accounts on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts owed to us could be adversely affected 
inventories inventory purchases and commitments are based upon estimates of future demand that are difficult to forecast 
if i there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  ii there is a higher rate of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  and or iii the market value and selling prices of our products to our customers decline or the price at which these customers can purchase similar products from other manufacturers is lower than ours  we may be required to reduce our inventory values which would result in lower of cost or market value adjustments 
such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit 
the obsolescence risk related to digital cameras is more significant than mm traditional film and single use cameras due to  among other factors  the shorter life cycles of digital products 
see item a  risk factors  above 
deferred income taxes the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets on an ongoing basis and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary 
in determining the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives and strategies 
we have a full valuation allowance on all of our deferred income tax assets as of july  and july  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
alternatively  if we determine that we would not be able to realize a recorded deferred income tax asset  an adjustment to increase our valuation allowance would be charged to the results of operations in the period in which we reach such a conclusion 
impairment of long lived and other assets periodically  we review our long lived assets for impairment 
we record an impairment loss when indications of impairment are present and undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying values 
since we incurred significant operating losses in fiscal and fiscal  a potential impairment indicator  we performed an impairment test of our long lived and other assets as of july  by summarizing the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual sale of our long lived and other assets 
if the carrying value of the assets exceed the estimated undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we determine fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows or external appraisals 
assets reviewed included patents  prepaid amounts related to licensing and royalty agreements and property  plant and equipment

see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal income tax provision relates primarily to income tax liabilities incurred by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
these foreign subsidiaries do not have net operating losses to offset such liabilities 
as a result of current and prior year losses realized by our foreign subsidiaries  the foreign subsidiaries have an accumulated earnings deficit of approximately million as of july  although  we have an accumulated earnings deficit related to most of our foreign subsidiaries  certain of our foreign subsidiaries have undistributed earnings 
historically  we do not provide for us federal and state income taxes on such undistributed earnings based on the re investment of such earnings outside the united states 
as of july   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards are scheduled to expire between and additionally  we have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards related to our foreign operations  of which million relates to hong kong

in connection with the restructuring initiatives  we also incurred other charges related to retention costs of employees who were not terminated in fiscal the services of these employees benefited parts of the business other than the manufacture of digital cameras 
accordingly  these retention costs are classified as other charges in table iv below 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million in expenses related to employee retention costs associated with the restructuring initiatives implemented in fiscal cost reduction initiatives we continue to evaluate our cost structure and implement cost reduction initiatives as appropriate 
during fiscal  cost reduction initiatives included  among other things  the separation of three executives and the elimination of certain employee positions 
as a result  during fiscal  we recorded total charges of million related to severance costs for the separation of the three executives and elimination of certain other employee positions 
see note  commitments and contingencies  executive separation agreements  for more information regarding the severance costs related to the separation of the three executives 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began implementing an operating strategy designed to significantly de emphasize the sale of digital cameras and increase our focus on the sales of single use and mm traditional film cameras 
in connection with this strategy  we are realigning our operations in europe including relocating certain operations from our jena  germany office to our united kingdom office 
as a result of the german office relocation in fiscal  we recorded charges of approximately million for severance costs 
in addition  as a result of our de emphasizing digital camera sales  we reduced our outsourcing organization in asia and recorded a total of million for employee severance costs 
we also recorded impairment charges totaling million related to the impairment of certain long lived assets which included a reduction in the carrying value of a license used primarily in the branding of digital cameras and in certain machinery held for sale in the amounts of million and million  respectively

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to net sales for fiscal the decrease in net sales was primarily due to a reduction in the sales volume of single use cameras sold to significant rsd and dms customers and lower average selling prices for digital cameras resulting from significant pricing competition and lower than anticipated sales by certain of our rsd customers 
this reduction in net sales was partially offset by the inclusion of a complete fiscal year of net sales related to our acquisition of jenimage in may see note  acquisition  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the jenimage acquisition 
rsd net sales were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal  and accounted for of total net sales 
rsd net sales from our operations in the americas for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease in rsd net sales was due primarily to reduced sales of single use and digital cameras to two significant customers 
this decrease in sales had a material adverse effect on fiscal results of operations 
the reduction in sales to one significant rsd customer was due to the customer s overstocked inventory levels of single use cameras during the first and second quarters of fiscal during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  sales of single use cameras to this customer increased over the levels of the second quarter of fiscal  and we expect sales of single use cameras to this customer will continue to increase as its inventory levels decrease 
the reduction in sales to the other significant rsd customer was attributable to a reduction in sales of digital cameras  partially offset by an increase in sales of single use cameras to such customer 
rsd net sales from our operations in europe for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was principally attributable to our acquisition of jenimage 
dms net sales were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal  and accounted for of total net sales 
the decrease in dms net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales to kodak  for whom we manufactured products under two dms agreements 
sales to kodak in fiscal accounted for of total net sales  while in fiscal  sales to kodak accounted for of total net sales 
as previously reported  kodak advised us that it would cease purchases under the two dms contracts during the second quarter of fiscal the winding down of sales to kodak had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for fiscal net sales from our operations in asia for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal net sales from our operations in asia for fiscal included rsd sales of million and all of our dms sales

gross deficit profit gross deficit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  versus gross profit of million  or of net sales  in fiscal during fiscal  gross deficit  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  was negatively affected by the following factors i reduced sales volume of single use cameras and lower average selling prices for digital cameras  ii a million charge to reduce the carrying value of certain finished goods  components  work in process  raw material and return camera inventory below its cost basis to its estimated market value resulting from price declines  iii restructuring and other charges of million consisting of a reduction in the carrying value of certain finished goods  components  work in process  raw material and return camera inventory below our cost basis to its estimated market value and employee severance costs attributable to our restructuring initiatives and cost reduction initiatives  iv lower production volumes in our manufacturing facilities that created under absorption of manufacturing labor and overhead and other costs of million  and v additional depreciation expense of million related to the reduction in the remaining useful lives of certain molds and tooling used in the production of certain digital cameras

operating expenses selling expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the cost of additional sales and marketing personnel and increases in freight related shipping costs 
selling expenses in fiscal also included costs incurred by jenimage 
general and administrative g a expenses  excluding variable stock based compensation or income  for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease in g a expenses was primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and decreases in professional fees associated with designing and installing our erp system  partially offset by increased costs and the recording of expenses related to previously capitalized costs incurred in connection with potential acquisitions 
g a expenses in fiscal also included costs incurred by jenimage 
we did not recognize any variable stock based compensation expense for fiscal because the price of our common stock was lower than the exercise price of of our repriced options at the beginning and end of the fiscal year 
variable stock based compensation income for fiscal was million because the price of our common stock on july  was lower than the price of our common stock used to compute variable stock based compensation expense in previous quarters

see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in average outstanding indebtedness under the financing facilities provided by hsbc during fiscal as compared to fiscal other income  net other income  net was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively

capital expenditures for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively  and related primarily to expenditures on plant and equipment for our manufacturing facilities in the prc

see hong kong financing facilities below for information about our financial guarantees 
hong kong financing facilities as we previously disclosed in reports filed with the sec  in october  concord camera hk limited cchk  our hong kong subsidiary  accepted a proposal from hsbc dated september  the september agreement that reduced cchk s borrowing capacity from an aggregate of approximately million under the previous agreement effective february to an aggregate of approximately million 
under the september agreement  the financing facilities consisted of an import facility of approximately million and a million foreign exchange facility  and cchk agreed to provide hsbc with security over cash deposits in the amount of million 
in january  cchk accepted a revised proposal from hsbc the january agreement 
under the january agreement  the million foreign exchange facility was eliminated and cchk agreed to provide hsbc with additional security over cash deposits in the amount of million 
in addition to the import facility of approximately million  the security also covered a guarantee facility of  euros equal to approximately  resulting in the required aggregate security over cash deposits of approximately million 
upon receipt of cchk s acceptance of the proposal and cchk s providing the additional security of million  hsbc agreed to cancel i our corporate guarantees up to the aggregate amount of million and  euros  ii certain liens securing substantially all of cchk s assets  iii the letters of undertaking from cchk to hsbc  pursuant to which  among other things  cchk was subject to certain covenants  and iv any and all of our and cchk s obligations under two subordination agreements between cchk and us  each dated march   pursuant to which we and hsbc agreed to subordinate approximately million in inter company payables from cchk to us to any amounts that cchk owed to hsbc 
on august   cchk accepted hsbc s proposal to renew the demand financing facilities under the same terms and conditions as contained in the january agreement 
the renewed financing facilities are subject to review by hsbc at any time  and  in any event  by june  see note  short term borrowings and financing facilities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the hong kong financing facilities 
at july  and july   we had zero and million  respectively  in short term borrowings outstanding under the import facility described above 
the weighted average borrowing rates on the short term borrowings as of july  and july   were and  respectively 
at july  and july   we had million and million  respectively  in letters of credit outstanding  which were issued primarily to certain suppliers to guarantee payment of our purchase orders with such suppliers 
the letters of credit are issued under our hsbc financing facilities 
exchange offer on august   we launched an offer to exchange outstanding stock options that had an exercise price of more than per share for new options to purchase of the shares subject to the outstanding options at an exercise price of per share representing the closing price of the common stock reported on the nasdaq national market on the date the board of directors approved the exchange offer 
the exchange offer expired on october  we accepted for exchange and cancelled options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock and issued new options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock in exchange for the cancelled options 
as a result of the exchange offer  we were previously required to apply variable accounting to these new stock options until the options are exercised  cancelled or expired unless the price of our common stock at fiscal year end is less than the exercise price of the repriced stock options 
for fiscal  we did not record any variable stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations because the stock price of our common stock on july  was below the exercise price of 
for fiscal  variable stock based compensation income was million because our stock price on july  was lower than the price of our common stock used to compute variable stock based compensation expense in previous quarters 
because the determination of variable accounting expense associated with the repriced stock options is dependent  in part  on our closing stock price at the end of each prospective reporting period  it is not possible to determine its future impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on our results of operations 
on july  we adopted sfas no

there can be no assurance  however  that any definitive agreement will be reached regarding any of the foregoing 
accelerated filer status on december   the sec published final rules that  among other things  revised the definition of accelerated filer to make it simpler for accelerated filers whose public float falls below the million threshold to exit accelerated filer status 
under the new rules  an accelerated filer that has voting and non voting equity held by non affiliates of less then million is permitted to exit accelerated filer status at the end of the fiscal year in which its equity falls below million 
this measurement is taken at the end of the company s second fiscal quarter 
if it is determined that the company is no longer an accelerated filer  it will be permitted to file its annual report for that year and subsequent periodic reports on a non accelerated basis 
accelerated filer status affects an issuer s deadlines for filing its periodic reports with the sec 
additionally  a non accelerated filer is not required to comply with the requirements of section with respect to an assessment of its internal control over financial reporting until its first fiscal year ending on or after december  since our closing common stock price on december  was per share and  of the approximately million shares outstanding  at least were held by our affiliates  our public float approximated million as of such date 
as a result  we exited accelerated filer status at the end of fiscal and we are now treated as a non accelerated filer with respect to the filing deadline for this annual report on form k form k and for the three quarterly reports that we will file with the sec during fiscal as a non accelerated filer  we are required to file our form k within days increased from days for accelerated filers after the fiscal year end and our quarterly reports within days increased from days for accelerated filers after the fiscal quarter end 
we are also not required to comply with the requirements of section until our fiscal year  which will provide us with temporary relief from compliance costs  including  without limitation  the costs incurred in connection with an annual audit related to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent registered public accounting firm 
during the period that we are treated as a non accelerated filer  we will  however  continue to incur costs for remediating the material weaknesses that we believe have not yet been remediated and for maintaining effective internal control over our financial reporting 
other events in fiscal and fiscal  certain of our foreign subsidiaries inadvertently sold approximately  and  respectively  of our products that were shipped to cuba  iran and syria 
one or more of the shipments may be in violation of regulations of the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac 
we informed the us treasury department of these matters and took steps to ensure future compliance with all ofac regulations 
to the extent we violated any regulations with respect to the above or other transactions  we may be subject to civil fines or other sanctions  which we believe will not be material 
we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
at july   our exposure to changes in interest rates was limited  since we had no outstanding debt 
since we have no outstanding debt  we do not deem interest rate risk to be significant or material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not presently use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
each of our foreign subsidiaries purchases their inventories in us dollars and certain of their sales are in foreign currency  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have purchased and continue to purchase in foreign currencies certain components  products  raw materials and services needed to manufacture and sell our products 
the impact of foreign exchange transactions is reflected in our statements of operations 
although we have previously analyzed the benefits and costs associated with hedging against foreign currency fluctuations  as of july   we were not engaged in any hedging activities  and we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding
