overview we are a leading supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is used for transistor level  or front end of line manufacturing  and also in specialized applications for processing the interconnect layer  or back end of line processing 
our manufacturing equipment utilizes innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
our tools  technologies and expertise are enablers in the semiconductor industry s transition to larger mm wafers  sub nm design rules and the use of new materials  such as copper  low capacitance low k dielectrics and barrier metals 
our business depends upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
because the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment is also highly cyclical 
due to a decline in wafer fab equipment investments by our customers  in our revenues decreased by to million from million in as a result of our continued efforts to control our operating costs in  we decreased our selling  general and administrative expenses by million  or  while we increased our activity in to expand our product portfolio to accommodate sub nanometer design rules  driving an increase in research  development and engineering expenses of million  or 
despite the decline in revenue in  we reported net income for the year while making significant investments in developing our next generation products 
part of our strategy is to outsource selected non critical functions in manufacturing  spare parts logistics  subsystem design and other areas to third parties specializing in these areas 
this allows us to concentrate our resources on our core technologies in strip and rtp  reduce our cost structure and achieve greater flexibility to expand and contract capacity as market conditions require 
in  we made progress in building a leaner  more flexible organization and demonstrated that we could maintain profitability through a full industry cycle 
although we have implemented cost cutting and operational flexibility measures  we are largely dependent upon increases in sales in order to improve our profitability 
we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and no long term debt at december  with the recent improvements in our operating results and our current strong cash position  we believe we are in a healthy position in terms of liquidity and capital resources 
going forward  the success of our business will be dependent on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment  and our ability to a develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  b grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers and c maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles 
adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment for and future years  we expect there to be a material increase in our compensation costs as a result of the additional stock based compensation expenses we will recognize under sfas no 
r share based payment 
depending on the magnitude and distribution of future equity compensation grants among employees in the different functional areas of our company  portions of the additional compensation expense may be allocated to our operating expenses selling  general and administrative  and research  development and engineering  and to cost of sales 
we continue to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our operations  including evaluating which transition method and pricing model to adopt  and how our equity compensation practices may change 
as a result  we are currently unable to quantify a forecast of the increased costs

sales 
the decrease in net sales in compared with was primarily due to a decrease in system sales of million  or  and a decrease in service and spare parts sales of million  or 
sales in represent a decline following very strong capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers in in  we received business from leading chipmakers in all regions we serve china  europe  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the united states 
korea was our largest expanding equipment market in  with sales increasing from  however overall sales declined due to a decline in sales of for japan  taiwan and other asian countries 
our net sales for included royalty revenue of million  compared with million for international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan  accounted for of net sales in  compared to for we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
the decrease in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to our overall decline in sales 
additionally  gross margin was negatively impacted by inventory valuation charges of million in our gross profit for included royalty revenue of million received from dns  compared with million for the royalty revenue carries no associated cost of revenues 
gross profit margin declined in compared with primarily due to inventory valuation charges  which accounted for percentage points of the decline in additionally  due to the lower overall sales volume in  warranty expenses as a percentage of sales increased percentage points in  although total warranty expenses were slightly lower 
due to intense competition  we continue to face pricing pressure that can affect our gross profit margin 
in  we continued to increase the proportion of manufacturing work performed by outsourcing partners 
this outsourcing strategy is a key element of our cfe business model  which is designed to enable us to expand and contract our manufacturing capacity to meet market conditions 
our gross profit margin has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  economies of scale and overhead absorption levels 
research  development and engineering 
rd e expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for our rd e staff as well as contractors fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and development of new products 
the increase in rd e expenses in compared with was primarily due to increased activity in to expand our portfolio of products capable of addressing stringent sub nm requirements 
selling  general and administrative 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel involved in the sales and marketing process  outside service costs  sales commissions  advertising and promotional materials  sales facilities expense  trade shows and seminars 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  administration  operations and general management  headquarters and general office facilities costs  as well as legal and accounting expenses 
in  we continued to streamline our internal operations and adjust our resources through outsourcing in an effort to create a more flexible organization that can operate profitably through changing industry cycles 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of a reduction of million due to reduced accounts receivables reserves in  decreases in travel expenses of million and corporate insurance expenses of million as part of our ongoing effort to streamline our operations  partially offset by higher outsourcing costs for professional services of million  primarily related to increased accounting and consulting expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses increased in compared to because of the decrease in net sales in amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses increased in compared with primarily due to our acquisition of vortek industries ltd 
in october we estimate our annual amortization expense to be million for the years through gain loss on disposition of wet business 
in  we received additional earn out payments of approximately million in relation to the disposition of our wet business in we recorded this payment as additional proceeds from the sale of the wet business  and the payment has been recorded as a reduction of operating expenses 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income increased in compared with due to higher investment balances in interest expense for and remained minimal 
the decrease in other income expense  net in compared with was primarily due to losses on forward foreign exchange contracts settled in january of million 
provision for income taxes 
the tax benefit in primarily consisted of a benefit of million due to a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a benefit of million from the settlement of controversies with foreign tax authorities 
the tax benefit in was primarily due to a tax benefit of million resulting from reduced foreign income tax liabilities  and a one time tax benefit of million related to a refund of taxes that had been previously withheld and expensed at the time of our dns settlement in the third quarter of  which were partially offset by tax expenses related to foreign operations

sales 
the increase in net sales in compared with was primarily due to an increase in strip and rtp system and spare parts revenues of million  or  partially offset by the decrease in wet product system revenues of million as a result of our divesture of the wet business in of the million increase  million resulted from higher strip and rtp system revenue for compared with in  over of our business was for mm products 
in  we received business from leading chipmakers in all regions we serve china  europe  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the united states 
our net sales for included royalty revenue of million  compared with million for international sales  predominantly to customers based in europe and the asia  including china  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan  accounted for of net sales for both and gross profit and gross profit margin 
the increase in gross profit for compared with was primarily due to increased system revenues  in particular from our higher margin products  including our next generation mm rtp system  the helios 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as it pertains to new products  we recognized no revenues related to shipments of our helios products made in helios related sales were reported as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet at december  gross profit reported for helios sales recognized in amounted to approximately million 
improved direct labor and overhead absorption for compared with resulted in an increase in gross margin of million 
additionally  in we benefited from improved reliability of installed systems  and accordingly were able to carry lower reserves for retrofitting costs  thereby increasing gross profit by million 
our gross profit for included royalty revenue of million received from dns  compared with million for the royalty revenue carries no associated cost of revenue 
gross profit margin improved in compared with primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products  particularly our helios rtp system 
gross profit margin in both and was also favorably impacted by improvements in our inventory management 
we had inventory valuation charges of million in  compared with inventory valuation charges of million for research  development and engineering 
the increase in rd e expense in compared with was primarily due to higher employee related costs as a result of increased headcount of our rd e function 
as a percentage of net sales  our rd e expenses decreased in compared with because of increased net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in compared with was primarily the result of additional variable expenses due to a higher level of business activity  primarily related to an increase in outside service charges of million as a result of increased outsourcing 
as a percentage of net sales  our sg a expenses decreased in compared to because we achieved higher net sales while better controlling our sg a expenses in amortization of intangibles 
amortization expenses decreased in compared with primarily due to a reduction in intangibles resulting from the divesture of our wet business in restructuring and other charges 
in  in connection with our consolidation of excess facilities into our current headquarters based in fremont  california  we accrued for lease termination costs of  in we also released  in unused facility related reserve balances relating to our restructuring plan for consolidation of excess facilities 
as a result  we had no restructuring charges recorded for we recorded restructuring and other charges of  in  including  for workforce reductions in fremont and germany and  for consolidation of excess facilities in california 
in connection with the workforce reductions  we terminated employees 
gain loss on disposition of wet business 
in march  we divested the portion of our business that related to developing  manufacturing  selling  and servicing wet surface preparation products for the cleaning and preparation of semiconductor wafers the wet business to scp global technologies  inc scp 
in connection with the sale of the wet business  we recorded a loss of million 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income remained flat in compared with  despite higher cash and cash equivalent balances  primarily due to lower average interest rates 
interest expense for and remained minimal 
the increase in other income expense  net in compared with was primarily due to gains on forward foreign exchange contracts 
provision for income taxes 
the tax benefit in was primarily due to a tax benefit of million resulting from reduced foreign income tax liabilities  and a one time tax benefit of million related to a refund of taxes that had been previously withheld and expensed at the time of our dns settlement in the third quarter of  which were partially offset by tax expenses related to foreign operations 
the tax expense in primarily consisted of tax expense related to foreign operations 
deferred revenue at december  and our deferred revenue at december  decreased to million from million at december   primarily due to a net decrease in deferred revenue for system shipments and service contracts in of approximately million 
the million in deferred revenue at december  consisted of million of deferred revenue related to installation services awaiting completion for sales of established products  million of deferred revenue related to recently introduced or evaluation products shipped and awaiting customer acceptance  million in unearned service contract revenue  and million in deferred spares revenue for undelivered products 
our deferred revenue at december  was approximately million  which consisted of million of deferred revenue related to installation services awaiting completion for sales of established products and million of deferred revenue related to recently introduced or beta products shipped and awaiting customer acceptance 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash and short term investments were million at december   an increase of million from million held as of december  stockholders equity at december  was million 
credit arrangements we have a million revolving line of credit with a bank  which may be increased to million at our option 
the revolving line of credit expires in april  and has an annual commitment fee of  all borrowings under this credit line bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
the line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets including intellectual property 
the line of credit requires us to satisfy certain quarterly financial covenants  including maintaining a minimum consolidated cash balance  maintaining a minimum domestic cash balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  maintaining a minimum balance of investment accounts  and not exceeding a maximum net loss limit 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants  and we had no borrowing under this credit line 
in june  our japanese subsidiary entered into a credit facility with a japanese bank in the amount of million yen approximately million at december   collateralized by specific trade accounts receivable of the japanese subsidiary 
the facility is subject to the short term prime rate  which was per annum as of december  the facility has an indefinite term  subject to termination at the option of either party 
we have given a corporate guarantee for this credit facility 
there are no financial covenant requirements for this credit facility 
at december   there was no borrowing under this credit facility 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table vendor commitments operating lease payments subcontractor inventory other total sublease income in thousands thereafter  in connection with the acquisition of vortek industries ltd  we became party to an agreement between vortek and the canadian minister of industry the minister relating to an investment in vortek by technology partnerships canada 
under that agreement  as amended  we or vortek agreed to various covenants  including a payment by us of a royalty to the minister of of revenues from flash rtp products  up to a total of cad  approximately million at december   and b vortek maintaining a specified average workforce of employees in canada through october  if we  or vortek  do not satisfy our obligations  the minister may demand payment of liquidated damages in the amount of cad  approximately million at december  less any royalties paid by vortek or us to the minister 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of this agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
legal settlement on june   we entered into a settlement agreement and a license agreement with dns under which dns agreed to make payments to us totaling between million minimum and million maximum  relating to past damages  partial reimbursement of attorney fees and costs  and license fees 
in  dns paid us million under the license agreements as royalties 
we have recorded million of the payment of million as royalty revenue in  which is recognized as net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we are scheduled to receive minimum annual royalty payments of million in april and million in april  totaling million 
royalty payments received by us in excess of the minimum annual payments  if any  will be recorded as royalty revenue and recognized as net sales in the period they are reported to us by dns  which is generally in june of each year 
liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash and short term investments of million 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operations in of million was primarily due to net income of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million  a decrease in advance billings of million  a decrease in inventories of million  and inventory valuation charges of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current and noncurrent assets of million 
a significant portion of the change in our balance sheet accounts resulted from a higher level of sales at the end of  which had required increased working capital 
in addition  the decrease in accounts receivable was partially due to increased efforts to collect older receivables in depreciation and amortization charges increased in primarily due to the acquisition of vortek in the fourth quarter of and higher depreciation related to our new enterprise resource planning system  which was placed in operation at the end of the increase in other assets in is primarily due to the recognition of million in net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of inventory valuation charges were primarily due to an increase in our estimated required reserves for spare parts inventories 
net cash used in operations in of million was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to reduction in inventory reserves of million as a result of improvement in inventory control and disposal of obsolete inventories and increases of inventories of purchased parts and raw materials of million  a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  largely due to reduction in tool related retrofit accruals  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  partially offset by net income of million  a decrease in advanced billings of million and depreciation and amortization charges of million 
net cash used in operations in of million was primarily due to net losses of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million due to our concerted effort during to address situations where customers had been slow to provide sign off  and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  offset by the decreases in inventories and inventories delivered systems of million  primarily due to the divesture of our wet business  a loss on disposition of the wet business of million  increases in accounts payable of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million due to an increase in receivables from dns  an increase in other assets of million  a loss on disposal of fixed assets of million  and the non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  collection of accounts receivable  and timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to purchases of available for sale investments of million  and capital spending of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million and gains from earn out payments related to the sale of our wet business of million 
our capital spending in was primarily due to capitalizing internally manufactured technology used in our rd e activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily due to purchases of available for sale investments of million  capital spending for the build out of our manufacturing operations as a result of consolidation of manufacturing facilities in fremont  california  loans to vortek prior to acquisition of million  and net cash of million paid in connection with the vortek acquisition  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million in consisted of purchases of property and equipment of million  purchases of available for sale investments of million  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million  and proceeds from the disposition of the wet business of million 
the purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of million in proceeds from stock plans and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
in  we established corporate credit cards with a new bank  and closed our previous corporate account  which had required a compensating cash balance of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted primarily of the net proceeds of million from an underwritten public offering of approximately million newly issued shares of common stock priced at per share issued in february we used the net proceeds received from the offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and potential strategic acquisitions or investments 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted of million in proceeds from stock plans and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
the decrease in restricted cash resulted from pledge deposits that were no longer required for leases in germany 
acquisitions and divestitures acquisition of vortek industries ltd 
on october   we acquired certain outstanding debt and equity ownership interests in vortek industries ltd 
vortek  a privately held corporation amalgamated under the laws of british columbia  for a total purchase price of million 
vortek  based in vancouver  canada  is a developer of millisecond flash annealing technology for rapid thermal processing of silicon wafers used in the manufacture of semiconductors 
the purchase price consisted of approximately million shares of mattson common stock valued at approximately million  and approximately million in cash for acquisition related expenses 
prior to the closing date of the vortek acquisition october   mattson provided loans to vortek aggregating million 
these loans still existed at december  and december  and were eliminated in consolidation 
as a result of the transaction  vortek became our wholly owned subsidiary 
of the shares of common stock issued by us in the vortek transaction   the escrow shares were held subject to an escrow agreement 
the escrow shares were subject to forfeiture in the event of valid indemnification claims within a period of months from october  no claims were presented and the escrow shares were released in october in connection with the vortek acquisition  we entered into a stock registration and restriction agreement  dated as of october   pursuant to which we agreed to register the shares issued in the vortek acquisition  other than the escrow shares  under the securities act of  for resale by the recipients subject to certain restrictions on the transfer of such shares 
this acquisition was consummated principally to expand and strengthen our rtp technology portfolio and support our long term growth strategy 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and  accordingly  the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition  based on management estimates and relative fair value assessments 
the results of operations of vortek have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date 
our allocation of the purchase price is summarized as follows purchase price allocation in thousands goodwill  existing technology estimated useful life of years  current assets  property  plant and equipment liabilities assumed  deferred tax liability on intangibles  total purchase price  in addition  we acquired cad million approximately million at december  of deferred tax assets in connection with the acquisition of vortek  which had a full valuation allowance at december  during the third quarter of  we adjusted the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the vortek transaction 
pursuant to the adjustment in the third quarter  we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets by approximately million 
this resulted in a reduction of goodwill of approximately million 
the resulting deferred tax asset has been offset against the recorded deferred tax liabilities of million in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
divesture of wet business on march   we sold the portion of our business that related to developing  manufacturing  selling  and servicing wet surface preparation products for the cleaning and preparation of semiconductor wafers the wet business to scp global technologies  inc scp 
we had originally acquired the wet business on january   as part of our merger with the semiconductor division of steag electronic systems ag steag and cfm technologies  inc cfm 
as part of this disposition  scp acquired certain subsidiaries and assets  and assumed certain contracts relating to the wet business  including the operating assets  customer contracts and inventory of cfm  all outstanding stock of mattson technology ip  inc mattson ip  a subsidiary that owned various patents relating to the wet business  and all equity ownership interest in mattson wet products gmbh  a subsidiary in germany that owned our principal wet business operations 
we retained rights to all the cash from the wet business entities  and all rights to payments under the settlement and license agreements with dainippon screen manufacturing co  ltd 
dns 
scp acquired the rights to any damages under pending patent litigation relating to patents owned by mattson ip 
scp assumed responsibility for the operations  sales  marketing and technical support services for our former wet product lines worldwide 
scp paid us the initial purchase price of million in cash 
that initial purchase price was subject to adjustment based on a number of criteria  including the net working capital of the wet business at closing  to be determined post closing based on a pro forma closing date balance sheet  and an earn out  up to an aggregate maximum of million  payable to the company based upon sales by scp of certain products to identified customers through december  in  we received earn out payments of approximately million from scp for sales of certain products to identified customers in we have recorded this payment as additional proceeds from the sale of the wet business 
the payment has been recorded as a reduction of operating expenses for in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
capital finance transactions on february   we sold approximately million newly issued shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering priced at per share 
this resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in the same offering  steag electronic systems ag steag  our largest shareholder at that date  sold approximately million outstanding shares 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified 
these reclassifications do not affect our net income or loss  cash flows or stockholders equity 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty obligations  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we account for equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for all sales of new products and  for the first quarter of and earlier periods  for all sales of wet surface preparation products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers who have purchased the same equipment with the same specifications and previously demonstrated acceptance provisions  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing existing products with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which we bifurcate a sale transaction into two separate elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
the two elements are the tool and installation of the tool 
under this approach  the portion of the invoice price that is due upon shipment  generally of the total invoice price  is recognized as revenue upon shipment and title transfer of the tool  and the remaining portion of the total invoice price  generally of the total invoice price  which is due once installation services have been accepted  is not recognized as revenue until final customer acceptance of the tool 
from time to time  however  we allow customers to evaluate systems  and since customers can return such systems at any time with limited or no penalty  we do not recognize revenue until these evaluation systems are accepted by the customers 
revenues associated with sales to customers in japan are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales of rtp products through our distributor in japan  where we recognize revenues upon title transfer to the distributor 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
we recognize service and maintenance contract revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on system sales generally ranges from months to months  depending on the product 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of revenue when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the equipment or parts 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts  generally at a customer s site  during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases  we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot be certain that we will continue to experience the same warranty costs that we have had in the past 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis  and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
when the terms of sale do not specify  we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and we also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with business acquisitions 
the value assigned to goodwill and intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
a severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not to be impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
there were no events or changes in circumstances during the first three quarters of which triggered an impairment review 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our first step annual impairment test based on management estimates and fair value assessments  which did not indicate any impairment  thus  the second step was not necessary 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
during the years ended december   and  we did not record any impairment charge 
income taxes 
in  we recognized a net deferred tax asset of million related to our german operations  as we expect it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit from the german net deferred tax asset as of december  for all other tax jurisdictions  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of adjustment

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending has been transacted in us dollars 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  nor hedge for these interest rate exposures 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of december  an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would not have a material adverse affect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates could harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio in the future 
by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments 
as of december  and all short term investments had a maturity of less than one year 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period  and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period
