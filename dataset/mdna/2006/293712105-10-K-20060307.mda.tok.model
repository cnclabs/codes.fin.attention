there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
executive summary this overview of management s discussion and analysis highlights selected information in this document and may not contain all of the information that is important to you 
for a more complete understanding of trends  events  commitments  uncertainties  liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting estimates  you should carefully read this entire document 
net income increased to million or per fully diluted share compared to million or per fully diluted share in our banking line of business posted strong loan and deposit growth 
average earning assets increased by million or 
portfolio loans grew by million  or and ended the year at billion 
the investment portfolio grew to million  a million or increase over deposits grew  or million and the bank was able to maintain an attractive deposit mix  with of the total held in interest free demand deposits 
asset quality remained strong 
non performing loans were just million or of portfolio loans and net charge offs represented only of average loans for the year 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of portfolio loans vs 
million also at the end of the increase in the allowance was the net result of million of provision for loan losses slightly offset by  of net loan charge offs in the year 
in  the provision for loan losses was million and net loan charge offs were million 
the decline in the provision for loan losses was due to lower non performing loan levels  continued strengthening of the st 
louis and kansas city economies and continued low delinquency rates 
the company s fully tax equivalent net interest rate margin increased from to  year to year 
the basis point improvement in net interest rate margin was primarily due to rising interest rates and the greater benefit of free balances demand deposits and shareholders equity 
in  the net interest spread improved basis points to as increases in earning asset yields were largely offset by increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
deposit service charges of million were essentially flat with those posted in a rising earnings credit rate throughout offset much of the benefit of the growth in numbers of accounts and services provided during the year 
total wealth management income increased by  or million  to million during the year driven by strong growth in the company s trust and wealth products groups 
this included  of commission income earned by millennium  which was acquired in october factoring out the benefit of the millennium acquisition  the company s wealth management business increased its income by million or for the year 
assets under administration increased almost million in as the result of a increase in the net number of trust client relationships 
this increase was offset by million of assets managed in a special common trust fund account which were distributed to clients as called for by contact in the fourth quarter of during the late third and throughout the fourth quarter of  the company elected to reposition a portion of its investment portfolio and recognized net losses of  increases in market rates for the two through four year maturity ranges and the company s overall interest rate sensitivity presented an opportunity to strengthen the expected total return on portfolio investments for and while the company s long range business model see form k filing dated july  calls for noninterest expenses to grow on average or less per year through  these expenses grew or million in over the million reported in excluding expenses incurred by millennium of  and  of amortization expenses related to that acquisition  noninterest expenses increased million or 
our three year compound annual growth rate ending in noninterest expenses was  still well under our goal  and expense management remains a priority for us 
the company s efficiency ratio improved from to in employee compensation and benefits represent the largest expense increase 
this was primarily due to increased payouts under the company s incentive bonus programs  including the k match program  which are tied to performance targets 
see noninterest expense below for more information 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate for the company was  an increase from the rate in during the company recognized a  reversal of the remaining deferred tax valuation allowance related to merchant banking losses in and the company recognized state income tax refunds of  related to amendments of prior state income tax returns 
see income taxes below for more information 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are considered most critical to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
because these estimates and judgments are based on current circumstances  they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate based on actual experiences 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of a materially different financial condition and or results of operations could reasonably be expected 
the impact and any associated risks related to our critical accounting policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses subject to the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments  management s evaluation process used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses combines several factors management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict  the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses  and therefore the adequacy of the allowance  could change significantly 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments the company employs derivative financial instruments to assist in its management of interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing  maturity and option characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this critical accounting policy are those affecting the estimation of fair value and hedge effectiveness 
fair value is based on quoted market prices 
factors that affect hedge effectiveness include the initial selection of the derivative that will be used as a hedge and how well changes in its cash flow or fair value has correlated and is expected to correlate with change in the cash flow or fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability 
past correlation is easy to demonstrate  but expected correlation depends upon projections and trends that may not always hold true with acceptable limits 
changes in assumptions and conditions could result in greater than expected inefficiencies that  if large enough  could reduce or eliminate the economic benefits anticipated when the hedges were established and or invalidate continuation of hedge accounting 
the consequence of greater inefficiency and discontinuation of hedge accounting results in increased volatility in reported earnings 
for cash flow hedges  this would result in more or all of the change in the fair value of the affected derivative being reported in income 
for fair value hedges  this would result in less or none of the change in the fair value of the derivative being offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability 
deferred tax assets the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that realization is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets are reduced if necessary  by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
in the event that management determines it would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  the company would need to adjust the recorded value of our deferred tax assets  which would result in a direct charge to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made 
likewise  the company would reverse the valuation allowance when realization of the deferred tax asset is expected 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january  under this accounting standard  amortization of goodwill ceased and instead the asset is periodically tested for impairment 
the company tests for impairment utilizing the methodology and guidelines established in sfas no 
on an annual basis 
this methodology involves assumptions including the valuation of the business segments that contain the acquired entities 
management believes that the assumptions utilized are reasonable 
however  the company may incur impairment charges related to goodwill in the future due to changes in business prospects or other matters that could affect our valuation assumptions 
intangible assets other than goodwill  such as trade name intangibles  which are determined to have finite lives are amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives of approximately five years 
we conducted our annual evaluation of our reporting units as of december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  for the period ending december  the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and goodwill impairment was not deemed to exist 
results of operations analysis net interest income comparison of vs 
net interest income is the primary source of the company s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings  used to fund interest earning and other assets 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates  which factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  and repricing frequencies 
net interest spread and net interest rate margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest rate margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest earning assets 
the net interest rate margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally demand deposits and shareholders equity  also support earning assets 
changes in the fed funds rate has a direct correlation on changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans issued by the bank 
throughout  slightly less than two thirds of the loan portfolio floated with the prime rate 
historically we have been asset sensitive  which means our assets generally re price faster than our liabilities 
therefore  the consecutive fed funds rate increases since late by the federal open markets committee fomc have had a positive influence on our net interest income and margin 
net interest income presented on a tax equivalent basis was million for  an increase of million or from the increase in net interest income was attributable to a higher level of interest earning assets combined with higher interest earning asset yields partially offset by higher volumes and rates of interest bearing liabilities 
average interest earning assets were billion in  an increase of million or from loans accounted for the majority of the growth  increasing by million or almost to million on average in for  interest income on loans increased million from growth and million due to the impact of the rate environment as noted above  for a net increase of million versus see rate volume below 
average interest bearing liabilities were million in  an increase of million or from the growth in interest bearing liabilities resulted from an million increase in interest bearing deposits  a million increase in subordinated debentures  and a million increase in borrowed funds including federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
the growth in earning assets was also supported by a million or increase in average noninterest bearing deposits a component of net free funds 
for  interest expense on interest bearing liabilities increased million due to this growth and the impact of rising rates increased interest expense on interest bearing liabilities by million versus the net interest rate margin for was  compared to in the yield on interest earning assets increased basis point bp from to 
the average loan yield increased bp to 
the yield on securities and short term investments combined was up bp to 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from in to 
the increase in cost of funds was primarily due to increases in money market and certificate of deposit rates given competitor pricing and the increasing interest rate environment 
comparison of vs 
net interest income presented on a tax equivalent basis was million for  an increase of million or from the net interest rate margin for was  compared to in the bp decrease in net interest rate margin is attributable to a bp decrease in interest rate spread the net of a bp lower yield on earning assets and no change in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  and a bp higher contribution from net free funds 
lower re pricing on fixed rate loan maturities  a less favorable earning asset mix  less interest income from cash flow hedges and price competition for new loans were the main factors responsible for the declining interest earning asset yield 
for  the cost of interest bearing liabilities remained level with at 
higher rates paid on interest bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts were offset by lower rates paid on certificates of deposit  subordinated debentures  and other borrowed funds 
the rates on interest bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts tend to track with treasury bill rates and national money market funds  both of which were rising in the company s certificate of deposit portfolio repriced to lower rates during the year as renewals reflected lower rates for these products in our local markets 
for  the yield on interest earning assets fell bp to  driven by a bp decline in the loan yield 
the average loan yield was 
competitive pricing pressures  refinancing to lower fixed rates and less interest income from cash flow hedges put downward pressure on loan yields in the yield on securities and short term investments combined was up bp to 
the interest earning asset rate changes reduced interest income by million  a combination of million lower interest on loans and million higher interest on securities and short term investments combined 
from a volume perspective  the growth and composition change of interest earning assets in contributed an additional million to net interest income  while the growth and composition of interest bearing liabilities cost an additional million  netting a million increase in net interest income 
average interest earning assets were million in  an increase of million or from loans accounted for the majority of the growth in interest earning assets  increasing by million or to million on average in and representing of average interest earning assets compared to in for  interest income on loans increased million from growth  but decreased million from the impact of the rate environment as noted above  for a net increase of million versus average interest bearing liabilities were million in  an increase of million or from the growth in earning assets was also supported by a million or increase in average noninterest bearing deposits a component of net free funds 
the growth in interest bearing liabilities came from a million increase in interest bearing deposits  a million increase in subordinated debentures  offset by a million decrease in borrowed funds includes federal home loan bank advances 
for  interest expense on interest bearing liabilities increased million due to this growth

wealth management income increased during the increase includes  of commission income earned by millennium since the acquisition in october 
excluding millennium  wealth management income increased million  or for the year 
the increase was the result of a growth rate in net trust client relationships as well as having a full year of revenue generated from the wealth products group wpg unit 
favorable market conditions and client mix also factored in this growth 
assets under administration increased almost million in  but were offset by million of assets managed in a special common trust fund account which were distributed to clients as called for by contact in the fourth quarter of during the second half of  we elected to reposition a portion of our investment portfolio by selling and reinvesting approximately million of investments

our efficiency ratio  which expresses non interest expense as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and other income  was for  improved from in the improved efficiency ratio was due to revenue growth and cost management across all lines of business 
noninterest expense for includes three months of millennium operations subsequent to the acquisition 
the following table summarizes noninterest expense for and december  in thousands change employee compensation and benefits occupancy furniture  equipment and data processing correspondent bank charges professional  legal and consulting other losses and settlement postage  courier and armored car meals  entertainment  and travel stationary and office supplies communications marketing and public relations director related expense noncompete expense fdic and other insurance amortization of debt issuance costs other total noninterest expense expense management remains a priority for the company 
our organic growth model calls for noninterest expenses to grow on average or less per year through these expenses grew or million in over excluding expenses incurred for millennium of  and  of amortization expenses related to the acquisition  noninterest expenses increased million  or 
our three year compound annual growth rate ending in noninterest expenses was  still well under our goal 
employee compensation and benefits 
our compensation programs reflect our philosophy that carefully selected associates who are properly trained  directed and motivated will dramatically impact our performance and represent a sustaining competitive advantage 
we compensate our associates in ways to attract and retain top performers  and to provide base salary  incentives and rewards that incent the behaviors consistent with a high performing company 
over the last three years  we have implemented a disciplined process for managing the performance of our associates against defined business goals and results 
the process includes frequent and candid performance feedback  measures individual contributions  differentiates individual performance and reinforces contribution with highly differentiated rewards 
two major components of our compensation program are the variable pay incentive bonus pool and the long term incentive plan ltip 
expenses under the company s incentive bonus programs  including the k match program  which is tied to performance targets  increased million over from million to million 
driving this increase were the company s eps growth in  asset quality statistics  and growth in deposits and wealth management revenue and referrals 
on january   the board of directors adopted a long term incentive plan 
under terms of the plan  the company will award restricted share units rsu s to selected personnel based on the company s three year rolling average increase in earnings per share in comparison to a peer group of approximately financial institutions 
rsu s will be expensed annually as they vest and will impact earnings per share accordingly in and beyond 
the amount expensed is easily determinable based on the number of rsu s times the stock price at award date 
this is in direct contrast to options where multiple levels of inputs and potentially multiple models would be necessary 
compensation expense related to the rsus was  in growth in wealth management revenues increased commissions by  salaries and benefits of new associates  annual merit increases  along with increases in medical and disability insurance costs contributed  to the increase 
recruiting fees increased  over actual expenses related to the acceleration of vesting on stock options were  the remaining increase was attributable to millennium 
all other expense categories 
excluding the increase in employee compensation and benefits and millennium  all other noninterest expenses increased million  or over occupancy expense increases were due to scheduled rent increases on various company facilities along with a full year of rent for additional space leased at the company s operation center and related leasehold improvements completed at the operations center 
the new st 
charles city banking location and the addition of millennium also contributed to the increase 
data processing expenses increased due to upgrades to our as computer system  licensing fee increases for our core banking system as a result of our increased asset size and increased maintenance fees for various company systems 
furniture equipment increases were due to the new st 
charles bank location  millennium and the expansion of the operations center 
the increase in professional  legal and consulting includes acquisition related activities  as well as  expenses for the further development of our business continuity plan  development of bank products  human resource consulting  investment management consulting and various legal issues 
meals and entertainment increases were due to the addition of millennium  various client related events and more employee travel between the st 
louis and kansas city banking locations 
in  director compensation was restructured to more competitive levels including restricted stock units granted to the directors 
mark to market adjustments for outstanding stock appreciation rights sars paid to the directors also increased over in and  the company recognized non compete expenses related to the former ceo  who resigned in in the first quarter of  our directors and officers liability coverage was renewed which resulted in increased insurance premiums 
during the renewal  based on our increased asset size and the current business environment  we increased the amount of insurance coverage 
the growth in bank deposits also increased fdic insurance expenses 
in  we expensed unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of million of trust preferred securities trups

employee compensation and benefits increased as the result of several items 
annual merit increases and higher compensation of new middle and senior management hired during and represent  of the increase 
payouts under the company s incentive bonus program and k match benefit  both of which are tied to performance targets increased  as a result of the higher compensation  payroll taxes increased  employee benefits increased  due to increased medical and disability insurance expenses and additional expenses related to life insurance and other benefits such as car allowances 
compensation expense increased  due to the accelerating of the vesting on the company s outstanding stock options 
these increases were partially offset by  in lower commission expenses related to our wealth management operations 
historically the company had used stock options as the long term incentive component of many officers total compensation 
these equity instruments helped align officer and shareholder interests and have proven to be an attractive tool for both recruiting and retaining talented officers 
beginning in late and during  the board and its compensation committee  like many others in public companies  became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of uncertainty and judgments required in valuing and expensing these options  since they are not publicly traded  and then having to record such uncertain amounts in future years 
in addition  the board and management were interested in tying long term incentives even more directly to the company s earning per share growth rates  while retaining the recruiting and retention power of equity based compensation 
based on the valuation and accounting uncertainties under proposed accounting treatment for stock options at the time  and the fact that no associates had been awarded any long term incentive for eighteen months in the midst of a very competitive environment for banking talent  the board of directors accelerated the vesting on the company s outstanding stock options during the fourth quarter of this action resulted in two financial reporting impacts 
first  the remaining fair value of all outstanding stock options was recognized in as part of the pro forma footnote disclosures 
secondly  the company recognized  of compensation expense in the fourth quarter of based on the product of the number of outstanding unvested options times the spread between their weighted average stock price and the company stock price on october  times the estimated option forfeiture rate of 
the forfeiture rate is based on the company s history over the past several years  but actual forfeiture effects in the future are measured and recognized in expense for any differences versus the estimate 
in summary  the acceleration of the options vesting assisted in the transition with officers to an even more closely aligned business metric  eliminated uncertain long term incentive plan expense impacts on future earnings  and rewarded officers for the performance of the past two years 
occupancy expense increased due to scheduled rent increases on various company facilities and additional space leased at the company s operation center 
the decrease in furniture  equipment and data processing is related to lower depreciation expense as some assets became fully depreciated 
the decrease in professional  legal and consulting expenses were related to non recurring expenses related to non performing loan legal issues and other special matters  as well as  legal issues and other special matters related to the sale of southeast kansas branches 
the decrease was offset by additional expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance and outside consulting for the company s compensation committee 
the remaining decrease was due to less work on special matters such as human resource consulting  tax consulting and various legal issues 
losses and settlements in both and include expenses for a legal settlement related to a loan dispute with another financial institution 
historically  we did not invest in marketing campaigns 
during  we began several initiatives to increase its presence in its two markets  including sponsoring a university for private business owners  soliciting customer surveys  and advertising in local business periodicals aimed at the company s target market 
these efforts continued in and expanded to include radio and television spots  which increased the cost of the campaign 
the decrease in director related expenses was related to director incentive and appreciation programs earned in including fewer outstanding stock appreciation rights sars  which require marking to market in versus prior to  sars were used as compensation for director time 
in  we recognized non compete expenses related to the former ceo  who resigned in in  the company recognized non compete expenses related to the former ceo and another former employee 
in  we wrote off  of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of million of trups 
the increase in other expenses is due to  of expenses related to a nonperforming loan and  write down on a foreclosed real estate property 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary on october   the company acquired a controlling interest in millennium 
the company records its non controlling interest in millennium  related to millennium s results of operations  in minority interest on the consolidated statement of income 
for the year ended december   we recorded  of minority interest 
income taxes in  the company recorded income tax expense of million on pre tax income of million  an effective tax rate of 
income tax expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were and for and  respectively 
in  a valuation allowance was established in the amount of million related to capital losses on certain merchant banking investments 
as of december   the company had determined it was more likely than not that certain of the deferred tax assets related to the capital losses would not be realized 
due to the availability of certain tax planning strategies in the fourth quarter of ie the sale of the branches which would generate significant capital gains  the company reversed  of the valuation allowance recorded in during  the company reversed the remaining  of the valuation allowance 
the nature and deductibility of these losses were finally determined when the company filed its income tax returns during also  during  the company recognized state income tax refunds of  related to amendments of prior state income tax returns 
exclusive of these non recurring items  the effective tax rate in would have been approximately 
financial condition comparison for the years ended december  and total assets at december  were billion  an increase of million  or  over total assets of billion at december  the increase in total assets was related to growth in loans and investment securities 
loans were billion  an increase of million  or  over total loans of million at december  while new loan originations were strong during the year the bank experienced a higher than normal level of refinance activity as clients took advantage of the relatively flat yield curve to refinance floating rate debt to the fixed rate permanent markets 
management does not currently believe that it is in the company s long term best interest to compete aggressively for longer term fixed rate loans at these pricing levels 
investment securities were million  an increase of million  or  from a comparable balance of million at december  at december   investment securities included million of short term discount agency securities  which matured in january compared to million in short term discount agency securities  which matured in january these investments were used as an alternative to overnight funds to obtain higher yield 
during  we sold million of investment securities and reinvested the proceeds to reposition the portfolio 
realized losses of  were recorded 
the realized losses were slightly offset by  of realized gains on the sale of equity securities 
goodwill and intangible assets were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in goodwill and intangible assets was related to the purchase of millennium 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the growth in loans was primarily funded by increases in deposits and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
total deposits at december  were billion  an increase of million  or  over total deposits of million at december  the deposit growth was recorded across all deposit categories  except savings  as a result of new client relationships and increased sales penetration of existing clients 
early in  to take advantage of lower rates  we executed million of brokered cd s to replace the same amount that was maturing later in the year 
as our asset growth continued  in mid year we entered into million of long term fhlb advances at a weighted average rate of with a weighted average term of years 
the fhlb advances were available at more attractive rates than the broker cd market 
at december   fhlb advances were million  an million increase over december  there were no short term fhlb advances outstanding at december  junior subordinated debentures increased by million due to a pooled trust offering that was issued on october  though a statutory trust established by the company 
in conjunction with the issuance of the trust preferred offering  the company issued million in junior subordinated debentures to the trust 
the issuance of the additional junior subordinated debentures was to partially fund the acquisition of millennium 
federal funds fed funds sold were million at december  compared to million of fed funds purchased at december  stronger deposit growth relative to loan growth during resulted in higher liquidity levels 
given our outlook for the first quarter  we expect to utilize most of this liquidity after our seasonal deposit runoff for loan volume 
th quarter discussion the company earned million in net income for the fourth quarter ended december   a million increase over net income of million the same period in the net interest rate margin was for the fourth quarter of as compared to for the same period in net interest income in the fourth quarter of increased million from the fourth quarter of this increase in net interest income was the result of a million increase in interest income offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the yield on average interest earning assets increased to during the fourth quarter of as compared to during the same period in the increase in asset yield was due to several prime rate increases during the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to for the fourth quarter of from for the same period in this increase is attributed mainly to an increase in money market interest rates and certificates of deposit due to the rate environment 
the provision for loan losses was  in the fourth quarter of versus  in the decrease of  was due to lower non performing loan levels  continued strengthening local economies and continued low delinquency rates 
noninterest income was million during the fourth quarter of  a  increase over million in noninterest income during the same period in the increase includes  of commission income earned by millennium since the acquisition in october of offset by  of net realized losses from the sale of securities 
the remaining increase is due to increased income from the trust division of the bank 
noninterest expense was million during the fourth quarter of versus million during the same period in this represents a million increase 
the increase includes  of expense incurred by millennium since the acquisition in october of including  of amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition 
the remaining increase was primarily due to additional compensation expense tied to the our incentive bonus programs  including the k match program  which is tied to performance targets such as eps growth  asset quality statistics  and growth in deposits and wealth management revenue and referrals 
income tax expense was million during the fourth quarter of versus million in the same period in the effective tax rates were and  respectively for the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
loans total loans  less unearned loan fees  increased million  or during the company s lending strategy emphasizes commercial  residential real estate  real estate construction and commercial real estate loans to small and medium sized businesses and their owners in the st 
louis and kansas city metropolitan markets 
consumer lending is minimal 
a common underwriting policy is employed throughout the company 
lending to these small and medium sized businesses are riskier from a credit perspective than lending to larger companies  but the risk tends to be offset with higher loan pricing and ancillary income from cash management activities 
the company has implemented a targeted hiring program designed to attract and retain experienced commercial middle market bankers in both the st 
louis and kansas city markets 
as a result of this strategy the company has targeted  and will continue to target larger and more sophisticated commercial and industrial and commercial real estate clients 
it is expected that the company s average relationship size will increase resulting in greater efficiencies as the same level of cost can originate and service larger average relationships and their related higher revenues 
in addition  it is anticipated that the characteristics of the credit requirements of these clients will require a heavier underwriting emphasis on cash flows as the primary credit granting criteria 
the following table sets forth the composition of the company s loan portfolio by type of loans at the dates indicated december  in thousands commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other less portfolio loans held for sale total loans december  commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other less portfolio loans held for sale total loans commercial and industrial loans include loans to a diverse range of industries that are made based on the borrowers character  experience  general credit strength  and ability to generate cash flows for repayment from income sources  even though such loans may also be secured by real estate or other assets 
the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations 
real estate loans are also based on the borrowers character  but more emphasis is placed on the estimated collateral values 
real estate commercial loans are mainly for owner occupied business and industrial properties  multifamily properties  and other commercial properties on which income from the property is the primary source of repayment 
credit risk on these loan types is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction loans by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in local markets  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
in many cases the company will take additional real estate collateral to further secure the overall lending relationship 
real estate construction loans  relating to residential and commercial properties  represent financing secured by real estate under construction for eventual sale 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the company  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the company to ensure that they are economically viable 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is confined to specific geographic areas  but is also influenced by general economic conditions 
the company controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in the company s primary markets to local developers with which the company has a strong relationship 
in addition  the company reviews the merits of each individual project and regularly monitors project progress and construction advances 
real estate residential loans include residential mortgages which consist of loans that  due to size  do not qualify for conventional home mortgages  that the company sells into the secondary market and second mortgages and home equity lines 
residential mortgage loans are usually limited to a maximum of of collateral value 
consumer and other represent loans to individuals secured by personal assets such as automobiles or investment securities 
credit risk is controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions on such loans 
portfolio loans held for sale relate to loans originated by the southeast kansas branches that were sold on april  factors that are critical to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   no significant concentrations existed in the company s portfolio in excess of of loans 
loans at december  mature or reprice as follows loans maturing or repricing in thousands in one year or less after one through five years after five years total fixed rate loans commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other total variable rate loans commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other total loans commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other total loan balances are shown net of unearned loan fees 
not adjusted for impact of interest rate swap agreements 
as indicated in the above maturity table  most of our lending is done on a variable rate basis based on prime 
in addition  most loan originations have one to three year maturities 
while the loan relationship has a much longer life  the shorter maturities allow the company to revisit the underwriting and pricing on each relationship periodically 
fixed rate loans comprise of the loan portfolio at december  versus at the end of this trend is consistent with the recent interest rate environment  especially with a flat yield curve 
management monitors this mix as part of its interest rate risk management 
see interest rate risk section 
allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  a thorough review of potential borrowers  and ongoing review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  further ensures appropriate management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other factors that could affect probable credit losses 
assessing these numerous factors involves significant judgment 
management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy see section critical accounting policies 
the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off and recoveries on loans previously charged off  by loan category  and additions to the allowance charged to expense 
at december  in thousands allowance at beginning of period loans charged off commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other total recoveries of loans net loans charged off provision for loan losses allowance at end of period average loans total loans nonperforming loans net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to loans loans charged off are subject to continuous review  and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal  accrued interest  and related expenses 
the company s credit management policies and procedures focus on identifying  measuring  and controlling credit exposure 
these procedures employ a lender initiated system of rating credits  which is ratified in the loan approval process and subsequently tested in internal loan reviews and regulatory bank examinations 
the system requires rating all loans at the time they are made  at each renewal date and as conditions warrant 
adversely rated credits  including loans requiring close monitoring  which would normally not be considered criticized credits by regulators  are included on a monthly loan watch list 
other loans are added whenever any adverse circumstances are detected which might affect the borrower s ability to meet the terms of the loan 
this could be initiated by any of the following delinquency of a scheduled loan payment  deterioration in the borrower s financial condition identified in a review of periodic financial statements  decrease in the value of collateral securing the loan or  change in the economic environment in which the borrower operates 
loans on the watch list require detailed loan status reports  including recommended corrective actions  prepared by the responsible loan officer every three months 
these reports are then discussed in formal meetings with the senior credit administration officer  chief credit officer and chief executive officer of the bank 
downgrades of loan risk ratings may be initiated by the responsible loan officer  internal loan review  or the credit analyst department at any time 
upgrades of certain risk ratings may only be made with the concurrence of the senior credit administration officer  chief credit officer and loan review officer 
in determining the allowance and the related provision for loan losses  three principal elements are considered specific allocations based upon probable losses identified during a monthly review of the loan portfolio  allocations based principally on the company s risk rating formulas  and an unallocated allowance based on subjective factors 
the first element reflects management s estimate of probable losses based upon a systematic review of specific loans considered to be impaired 
these estimates are based upon collateral exposure  if they are collateral dependent for collection 
otherwise  discounted cash flows are estimated and used to assign loss 
the second element reflects the application of our loan rating system 
this rating system is similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulators 
loans are rated and assigned a loss allocation factor for each category that is consistent with our historical losses  adjusted for environmental factors 
the higher the rating assigned to a loan  the greater the allocation percentage that is applied 
the unallocated allowance is based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly reflected in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they may not be identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the unallocated allowance include the following general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  competitive factors resulting in shifts in underwriting criteria  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  bank regulatory examination results  and findings of our internal loan review department 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussion with our entire lending staff 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such conditions may be reflected as a specific allowance  applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such condition is reflected in the unallocated allowance 
based on this quantitative and qualitative analysis  provisions are made to the allowance for loan losses 
such provisions are reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category is a result of the analysis above 
the allocation methodology applied by the company  designed to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  and historical losses on each portfolio category 
because each of the criteria used is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management continues to target and maintain the allowance for loan losses equal to the allocation methodology plus an unallocated portion  as determined by economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors affecting the company s borrowers  as described above 
the following table is a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december  december  in thousands allowance percent by category to total loans allowance percent by category to total loans allowance percent by category to total loans allowance percent by category to total loans allowance percent by category to total loans commercial and industrial real estate commercial construction residential consumer and other loans held for sale not allocated total allowance prior to  the methods of calculating the allowance requirements had not changed significantly over time 
the reallocations among different categories of loans that appear between periods were the result of the redistribution of the individual loans that comprise the aggregate portfolio due to the factors listed above 
however  the perception of risk with respect to particular loans within the portfolio will change over time as a result of the characteristics and performance of those loans  overall economic and market trends  and the actual and expected trends in nonperforming loans 
consequently  while there are no specific allocations of the allowance resulting from economic or market conditions or actual or expected trends in nonperforming loans  these factors are considered in the initial assignment of risk ratings to loans  subsequent changes to those risk ratings and to a lesser extent in the size of the unallocated allowance amount 
beginning in  as a part of an overall effort to further improve its risk assessment  the company refined its methodology with special attention to the unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is based on factors that cannot necessarily be associated with a specific loan or loan category 
in its assessment  management focused on the following factors and conditions there is a level of imprecision necessarily inherent in the estimates of expected loan losses  and the unallocated reserve gives reasonable assurance that this level of imprecision in our formula methodologies is adequately provided for 
with respect to the real estate sector  management considered the continued weakness in the commercial office market with vacancy rates continuing to remain high and rents continuing to remain soft 
pressures to maintain and grow the loan portfolio in a slower economic environment with increasing competition from de novo institutions and larger competitors have to some degree affected credit granting criteria adversely 
the company monitors the disposition of all credits  which have been approved through its executive loan committee in order to better understand competitive shifts in underwriting criteria 
while the bank s target client has not changed  the bank is focusing more of its calling efforts on larger middle market commercial and industrial companies 
this move up market results in larger average loans per client  and generally more complex credit structures 
while the company has no significant specific industry concentration risk  analysis showed that over of the loan portfolio was dependent on real estate collateral 
the company has policies  guidelines  and individual risk ratings in place to control this exposure at the transaction level 
however  the percentage of the portfolio secured by commercial real estate increased from at december  to at december  given the trend of rising rates inherent in the current economic cycle and the likely adverse impacts on borrowers debt service coverage ratios  management believed it was prudent to increase the unallocated allowance component 
additionally  the company continues to be committed to a strategy of acquiring relationships with larger commercial and industrial companies 
the percentage of the portfolio represented by these clients increased from at december  to at december  management believed it was prudent to increase the percentage of the unallocated allowance to cover the risks inherent in the higher average loan size of these relationships 
finally  management believed that the level of competition for credit relationships had increased substantially over the prior year in both of our primary markets 
during  the entry of national city bank into the st 
louis market along with six new banking charters are examples of the increased level of competition 
to the extent that substantially increased levels of competition for credit may inherently result in an increased level of credit risk  management believed it was prudent to increase the company s unallocated allowance component 
as a result of the above analysis  management increased the unallocated allowance by million from to the factors noted for are still applicable at december  the increase in the unallocated allowance from to is primarily due to the increase in loan balances and the continued increase in interest rate levels and their impact on borrower cash flows and real estate values 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans with payments past due days or more and still accruing interest  restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
the following table presents the categories of nonperforming assets and certain ratios as of the dates indicated at december  in thousands non accrual loans loans past due days or more and still accruing interest restructured loans total noperforming loans foreclosed property total non performing assets total assets total loans total loans plus foreclosed property nonperforming loans to loans nonperforming assets to loans plus foreclosed property nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to non performing loan nonperforming loans are defined as loans on nonaccrual status  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and are in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate 
nonperforming loans were million at december  the decrease in nonperforming loans from the prior year was due to successful efforts by relationship managers to encourage customers to either refinance the credit at another financial institution or liquidate collateral and reduce our exposure 
in some other cases  the nonperforming loans were charged off or the assets securing the loan were foreclosed and the recovery process begun 
at december   the nonperforming loans consisted of five accounts 
two of the accounts accounted for of the total nonperforming loans 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the nonperforming loans related to a printing company and the remainder consists of five and eight different borrowers  respectively 
at december  and  million of the restructured loans related to an auto dealership that had financial difficulties 
at december   million or of the nonaccrual totals related to the owner of a large distribution company that filed bankruptcy 
the remainder of the balances in and represent ten to twenty different borrowers 
the company s nonaccrual loans and restructured loans meet the definition of impaired loans under us gaap 
as of december   and  the company had   and impaired loans  respectively  all of which are considered potential problem loans as well 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
investment securities at december   the investment securities portfolio was million  or of total assets 
our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed pools  collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal bonds 
our equity investments primarily consist of equity investments in the fhlb des moines 
the size of the investment portfolio is generally of total assets and will vary within that range based on liquidity 
typically  management classifies securities as available for sale to maximize management flexibility  although securities may be purchased with the intention of holding to maturity 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with related unrealized net gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  recorded as an adjustment to equity capital 
the table below sets forth the carrying value of investment securities held by the company at the dates indicated december  in thousands amount percent of total securities amount percent of total securities amount percent of total securities us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies mortgage backed securities municipal bonds equity securities included in us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies were million of short term discount agency notes that matured in january these investments were used as an alternative to overnight funds to obtain higher yield given the excess liquidity

deposits the following table shows  for the periods indicated  the average annual amount and the average rate paid by type of deposit for the year ended december  in thousands average balance weighted average rate average balance weighted average rate average balance weighted average rate interest bearing transaction accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit noninterest bearing demand deposits we continued to experience rapid loan and deposit growth due to aggressive direct calling efforts of relationship officers 
management has pursued closely held businesses whose management desires a close working relationship with a locally managed  full service bank 
due to the relationships developed with these customers  management views large deposits from this source as a stable deposit base 
in  the company began using brokered certificates of deposit to help fund its growth 
in the future  the bank expects to continue to use certificates of deposit sold to retail customers of regional and national brokerage firms ie brokered certificates of deposit 
at december  and  the company had million in brokered certificates of deposit 
maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more are as follows in thousands total three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the company has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to meet its commitments as they become due 
funds are available from a number of sources  such as from the core deposit base and from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
additionally  liquidity is provided from sales of the securities portfolio  lines of credit with major banks  the federal reserve and the federal home loan bank  the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits and the ability to sell loan participations to other banks 
the company s liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements  such as the loan to deposit ratio  wholesale deposits as a percentage of total deposits  and various dependency ratios used by banking regulators 
the company s liquidity framework also incorporates contingency planning to assess the nature and volatility of funding sources and to determine alternatives to these sources 
strong capital ratios  credit quality and core earnings are essential to retaining cost effective access to the wholesale funding markets 
deterioration in any of these factors could have an impact on the company s ability to access these funding sources and  as a result  these factors are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity management process 
while core deposits and loan and investment repayments are principal sources of liquidity  funding diversification is another key element of liquidity management 
diversity is achieved by strategically varying depositor types  terms  funding markets  and instruments 
we manage the parent company s liquidity to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to shareholders  service debt  invest in the bank as necessary  and satisfy other operating requirements 
the parent company s primary funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements are dividends from subsidiaries  borrowings against its million line of credit with a major bank  and proceeds from the issuance of equity ie stock option exercises 
the bank is subject to regulations and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the company s shareholders or for other cash needs 
another source of funding for the parent company includes the issuance of subordinated debentures 
in october of  the company issued million of additional subordinated debentures as part of a trust preferred securities pool trups at a fixed rate of for five years 
following the five year period  the trups will pay a variable rate of three month libor plus bp that reprices quarterly 
these securities are classified as debt but count as regulatory capital and the related interest expense is tax deductible  which makes them very attractive 
investment securities are an important tool to the company s liquidity objective 
as of december   the entire investment portfolio was available for sale 
of the million investment portfolio available for sale  million was pledged as collateral for public deposits  treasury  tax and loan notes  and other requirements 
the remaining securities could be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity if necessary 
the bank has a variety of funding sources in addition to key liquidity sources  such as core deposits  loan repayments  loan participations sold  and investment portfolio sales available to increase financial flexibility 
at december   the bank had million available from the federal home loan bank of des moines under a blanket loan pledge  absent the bank being in default of its credit agreement  and million available from the federal reserve bank under a pledged loan agreement 
the bank also has access to over million in overnight federal funds lines purchased from various banking institutions 
finally  because the bank plans to remain a well capitalized institution  it has the ability to sell certificates of deposit through various national or regional brokerage firms  if needed 
over the normal course of business  the company enters into certain forms of off balance sheet transactions  including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
these transactions are managed through the company s various risk management processes 
management considers both on balance sheet and off balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of the company s liquidity 
the company has million in unused loan commitments as of december  while this commitment level would be very difficult to fund given the company s current liquidity resources  we know that the nature of these commitments are such that the likelihood of such a funding demand is very low 
for the year ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities was materially consistent 
net cash used in investing activities was million in versus million in the decrease of million was primarily due to a reduction in investment security activity 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in versus million in this increase consisted of greater deposit growth in  the issuance of subordinated debentures and additional long term federal home loan bank advances 
risk based capital guidelines were designed to relate regulatory capital requirements to the risk profile of the specific institution and to provide for uniform requirements among the various regulators 
currently  the risk based capital guidelines require the company to meet a minimum total capital ratio of of which at least must consist of tier capital 
tier capital consists of a common shareholders equity excluding the unrealized market value adjustments on the available for sale securities and cash flow hedges  b qualifying perpetual preferred stock and related additional paid in capital subject to certain limitations specified by the fdic  and c minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less d goodwill  e mortgage servicing rights within certain limits  and f any other intangible assets and investments in subsidiaries that the fdic determines should be deducted from tier capital 
the fdic also requires a minimum leverage ratio of  defined as the ratio of tier capital to average total assets for banking organizations deemed the strongest and most highly rated by banking regulators 
a higher minimum leverage ratio is required of less highly rated banking organizations 
total capital  a measure of capital adequacy  includes tier capital  allowance for loan losses  and subordinated debentures 
the following table summarizes the company s risk based capital and leverage ratios at the dates indicated at december  in thousands tier i capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio tier i capital to average assets tangible capital to tangible assets tier i capital total risk based capital risk management market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the company faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through transactions other than trading activities 
market risk from these activities  in the form of interest rate risk  is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the company uses financial modeling techniques to measure interest rate risk 
these techniques measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing interest rate environments 
guidelines established by the company s asset liability management committee and approved by the company s board of directors are used to monitor exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the company feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the company s exposure to a bp and bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the company uses a static gap analysis and earnings simulation model 
the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate interest bearing demand deposits  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition  mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds 
the following table represents the estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions calculated as of december  significant assumptions used for this table included loans will repay at historic repayment rates  interest bearing demand accounts and savings accounts are interest sensitive due to immediate repricing  and fixed maturity deposits will not be withdrawn prior to maturity 
a significant variance in actual results from one or more of these assumptions could materially affect the results reflected in the table 
in thousands year year year year year beyond years or no stated maturity total interest earning assets investments in debt and equity securities interest bearing deposits federal funds sold loans loans held for sale total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings  now and money market deposits certificates of deposit subordinated debentures other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap gap by period cumulative gap ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities periodic cumulative gap adjusted for the impact of the interest rate swaps 
at december   the company was asset sensitive on a cumulative basis for all periods based on contractual maturities 
asset sensitive means that assets will reprice faster than liabilities 
along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of short term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus and basis point parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net interest income for the next month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the company s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus basis points parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations for december   projected that net interest income would increase by approximately if rates rose by a basis point parallel rate shock  and projected that the net interest income would decrease by approximately if rates fell by a basis point parallel rate shock 
the company uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above 
they are used to modify the company s exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources 
at december   the company had million in notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk 
derivative financial instruments are also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities through the normal course of operations  the company has entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
such obligations relate to funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances  as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial services provider  the company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the company  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the company 
the required contractual obligations and other commitments at december  were as follows in thousands total less than year over year less than years over years operating leases certificates of deposit subordinated debentures federal home loan bank advances commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit the company also enters into derivative contracts under which the company is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of these contracts changes daily as market interest rates change 
derivative liabilities are not included as contractual cash obligations as their fair value does not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts 
effects of new accounting standards on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft for accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the proposed interpretation would clarify the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fas an enterprise would be required to recognize  in its financial statements  the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained on audit based solely on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether the probable recognition threshold has been met  this proposed interpretation would require the presumption that the tax position will be evaluated during an audit by taxing authorities 
the term probable is used in this proposed interpretation consistent with its use in fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  to mean the future event or events that are likely to occur 
individual tax positions that fail to meet the probable recognition threshold will generally result in either a a reduction in the deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or b an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or the reduction of an income tax refund receivable 
the impact may also include both a and b 
this proposed interpretation also would provide guidance on disclosure  accrual of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and transition 
if approved  the interpretation would be effective as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after december  the fasb comment period ended on september  we are waiting on the final decision related to this interpretation by fasb and are presently unable to determine its overall impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
on may   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no

and fasb statement no 
fas requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to do so 
fas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after december  early application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors during fiscal years beginning after june  we have evaluated the requirements of sfas no 
and expect the implementation will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in december  fasb issued fas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
fas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas no 
r requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the accounting provisions of fas r are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after june   therefore  we will be required to adopt fas r in the first quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts based on a fair value method similar to the methods required under fasr to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect the implementation of fas r will have less than effect on our earnings per share in in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on criteria to evaluate whether to record a loss and disclose additional information about unrealized losses relating to debt and equity securities under eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the consensus applies to investments in debt and marketable equity securities that are accounted under fas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
after many organizations  including banks  which could be impacted by this guidance  asked for clarification on the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  the fasb postponed the implementation 
in july  the fasb decided not to provide additional guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment  but instead issued fasb staff position fsp eitf a  implementation guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf issue no
