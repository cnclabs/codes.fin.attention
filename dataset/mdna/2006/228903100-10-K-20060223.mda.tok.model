preservation services cryolife markets its preservation services to tissue procurement agencies  implanting physicians  and prospective tissue recipients 
the company works with tissue banks and organ procurement agencies to ensure consistent and continued availability of donated human tissue for transplant and educates physicians and prospective tissue recipients with respect to the benefits of cryopreserved human tissues 
procurement of tissue 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ procurement agencies and tissue banks 
after procurement  the tissue is packed and shipped  together with certain information about the tissue and its donor  to the company in accordance with the company s protocols 
the tissue is transported to the company s laboratory facilities via commercial airlines pursuant to arrangements with qualified courier services 
timely receipt of procured tissue is important  as tissue that is not received promptly cannot be cryopreserved successfully 
the procurement agency is reimbursed by the company for the costs associated with these procurement services 
the procurement fee and related shipping costs  together with the charges for the preservation services of the company  are ultimately paid to the company by the hospital with which the implanting physician is associated 
the company has developed relationships with approximately tissue banks and organ procurement agencies throughout the us management believes these relationships are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides the company with a significant advantage over potential new entrants to this market 
the company employs approximately individuals in donor services to work with organ procurement agencies and tissue banks  five of which are stationed throughout the country 
the company s central office for procurement relations is staffed hours per day  days per year 
preservation of tissue 
upon receiving tissue  a company technician completes the documentation control for the tissue prepared by the procurement agency and gives it a control number 
the documentation identifies  among other things  donor age and cause of death 
a trained technician then removes the portion or portions of the delivered tissue that will be processed 
these procedures are conducted under aseptic conditions in clean rooms 
at the same time  samples are taken from the donated tissue and subjected to the company s quality assurance program 
this program  which includes review of the donor and tissue charts by cryolife s tissue quality assurance department and its medical directors  may identify characteristics  which would disqualify the tissue for preservation or implantation 
once the tissue is approved  it is moved from quarantine to an implantable status 
tissue that does not pass testing is appropriately discarded 
cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues are cryopreserved in a proprietary freezing process conducted according to company protocols 
after the preservation process  the tissues are transferred to liquid nitrogen freezers for long term storage at temperatures at or below degree c 
the entire preservation process is controlled by guidelines established by the company 
distribution of tissue to implanting physicians 
after the tissue has cleared quality control assurance and the tissue is moved to an implantable status  the tissue is stored by the company or is delivered directly to hospitals at the implanting physician s request 
cryopreserved tissue must be transported under stringent handling conditions and maintained within specific temperature tolerances at all times 
cryopreserved tissue is packaged for shipment using the company s proprietary processes 
at the hospital the tissue is held in a liquid nitrogen freezer according to company protocols pending implantation 
the company provides a detailed protocol for thawing the cryopreserved tissue 
the company also makes its technical personnel available by phone or in person to answer questions 
after the company transports the tissue to the hospital  the company invoices the institution for its services  the procurement fee  and transportation costs 
the company provides company owned liquid nitrogen freezers to certain client hospitals 
the company has currently installed approximately of these freezers 
participating hospitals generally pay the cost of liquid nitrogen and regular maintenance 
the availability of on site freezers makes it easier for a hospital s physicians to utilize the company s preservation services by making the cryopreserved tissue more readily available 
because fees for the company s preservation services become due upon the shipment of tissue to the hospital  the use of such on site freezers also reduces the company s working capital needs 
marketing  educational  and technical support 
the company has records of over  cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic surgeons who have implanted tissues cryopreserved by the company during the past twelve months 
the company works to maintain relationships with and market to surgeons within these medical specialties 
because the company markets its preservation services directly to physicians  an important aspect of increasing the distribution of the company s preservation services is educating physicians on the use of cryopreserved human tissue and on proper implantation techniques 
trained field support personnel provide support to implanting institutions and surgeons 
the company currently employs approximately persons as technical service representatives and four region managers who deal primarily with cardiovascular and vascular surgeons and provide field support 
these representatives receive a base salary with a performance bonus 
the company has approximately independent technical service representatives and sub representatives who are employed by distributor groups who deal primarily with orthopaedic surgeons and who are paid on a commission basis 
the company sponsors physician training seminars where physicians teach other physicians the proper technique for handling and implanting cryopreserved human tissue 
the company also produces educational videotapes for physicians and coordinates live surgery demonstrations at various medical schools 
in addition the company coordinates laboratory sessions that utilize animal tissue to demonstrate surgical techniques 
members of the company s medical advisory board often lead the surgery demonstrations and laboratory sessions 
management believes that these activities improve the medical community s acceptance of the cryopreserved human tissue processed by the company and help to differentiate the company from other allograft processors 
to assist procurement agencies and tissue banks  the company provides educational materials and training on procurement  dissection  packaging  and shipping techniques 
the company also produces educational videotapes and coordinates laboratory sessions on procurement techniques for procurement agency personnel 
to supplement its educational activities  the company employs in house technical specialists that provide technical information and assistance  and maintains a staff hours per day  days per year for customer support 
bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices the company markets and distributes the cryolife o brien stentless porcine heart valve and the synergraft model vascular graft in the emea region 
marketing efforts for the cryolife o brien heart valve are primarily directed toward cardiac surgeons 
marketing efforts for the synergraft model are primarily directed toward vascular surgeons 
european operations the company markets its products in the emea region through its european subsidiary  europa  based in guildford  england 
europa  with its team of approximately ten employees  provides customer service  logistics  marketing  and clinical support to cardiovascular  vascular  thoracic  and general surgeons throughout the emea region 
europa markets and distributes the company s complete range of products through its direct sales representatives in england and wales and a network of independent agents and distributors in the emea region 
backlog the limited supply of tissue that is donated and available for processing typically results in a backlog of orders in the company s human tissue business 
the amount of backlog fluctuates based on the tissues available for shipment and varies based on the surgical needs of specific cases 
the company s backlog is generally not considered firm and must be confirmed with the customer before shipment 
the company currently does not have a backlog of orders related to bioglue or cryolife o brien heart valves 
the company had a minor backlog of synergraft bovine vascular grafts due to a manufacturing slow down earlier in the year 
research and development the company uses its expertise in biochemistry and cell biology  and its understanding of the needs of the cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic surgery medical specialties  to expand its surgical adhesive and preservation businesses in the us and to develop or acquire implantable products and technologies for these specialties 
the company seeks to identify market areas that can benefit from preserved living tissues and other related technologies  to develop innovative techniques and products within these areas  to secure their commercial protection  to establish their efficacy  and then to market these techniques and products 
the company employs approximately people in its research and development department  including six phds with specialties in the fields of molecular biology  protein chemistry  organic chemistry  and biochemistry 
in order to expand the company s service and product offerings  the company is currently in the process of developing or investigating several technologies and products  including technologies related to human tissue preservation to further enhance its safety  its protein hydrogel technology used in bioglue and other bioglue derivatives  additional applications of its synergraft technology  and its activation control technology act 
biofoam  a derivative of the pht  is in preclinical development 
biofoam contains an expansion agent  which has the potential to rapidly fill and seal internal body cavities  such as aneurysm sacs  and may provide hemostatsis in penetrating wounds and severe trauma 
the and defense appropriations conference reports included  and million  respectively  for the development of biofoam 
cryolife is currently involved in the initial animal trial with the us army s institute for surgical research 
biodisc  a derivative of the pht  is in a pilot clinical trial to determine its clinical utility as a durable nucleus pulposus replacement in spinal disc repair 
the nucleus pulposus is surrounded by fibrous tissue annulus and is located in the center of the vertebral disc 
the nucleus pulposus is composed of a gelatinous like material that acts as a cushion or shock absorber to the spinal column 
if the nucleus pulposus herniates through the annulus  it may be removed in a procedure known as a discectomy 
biodisc is designed to fill the area where the nucleus pulposus was removed  and is intended to prevent reherniation and maintain disc height 
currently there are nine patients enrolled in the study 
biolastic  another derivative of the pht may have the potential to be used as a pericardial replacement device to serve as a protective membrane and physical barrier to limit post operative tissue attachment 
currently under final development is a tissue based surgical mesh product utilizing an adaptation of the synergraft technology applied to bovine pericardia 
the acellular sheet material will be supplied sterile in a ready to use format  and is designed to be used in the reinforcement of soft tissue repairs where weaknesses in the tissues exist  and more specifically in the repair of various orthopedic injuries such as rotator cuff and tendon ruptures 
derived from animal sourced materials  the tissue repair matrix is designated as a medical device  and will require a k premarketing notification to fda prior to launch 
in february the company formed aurazyme pharmaceuticals  inc aurazyme to foster the commercial development of its act 
the act is a reversible linker technology that might have possible uses in the areas of fibrinolysis blood clot dissolving  and other drug delivery applications 
since management has been seeking to advance the development of drug delivery therapies utilizing the act through grants  research and development partnerships  joint ventures  and equity investments thereby allowing the company to focus its resources on the commercial development of its bioglue  synergraft technology  and other products under development 
to the extent the company identifies additional applications for its products  the company may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development of such applications or seek funding from outside sources to continue the commercial development of such technologies 
the company may also attempt to license technologies from third parties  such as it did with clearant  inc in december under that arrangement  cryolife licensed a patented technology based on gamma irradiation designed to inactivate microorganisms  including bacteria  viruses  and fungi from tissue obtained from human donors  while maintaining tissue integrity 
the license allows cryolife to use the clearant technology on certain orthopaedic tissues and requires that cryolife pay a royalty on revenues from tissues distributed with this technology 
working with clearant representatives  cryolife has further developed this technology and began employing it in processing certain human orthopaedic tissue in early the company began shipping its first orthopaedic tissue processed with clearant technology during the second quarter of the company s research and development strategy is to allocate available resources among the company s core market areas of preservation services  implantable biomaterials  and bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices  based on the size of the potential market for any specific product candidate and the estimated development time and cost required to bring the product to market 
research on these and other projects is conducted in the company s research and development laboratory or at universities or clinics where the company sponsors research projects 
in   and the company spent approximately million  million  and million respectively  on research and development activities on new and existing products 
these amounts represented approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years   and  respectively 
the company s medical and scientific advisory board consults on various research and development programs 
the company s pre clinical studies are conducted at universities and other locations outside the company s facilities by third parties under contract with the company 
in addition to these efforts the company may pursue other research and development activities 
manufacturing and operations the company s corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities consist of approximately  square feet of leased manufacturing  administrative  laboratory  and warehouse space located on a acre setting in suburban atlanta  georgia with an additional  square feet of offsite warehouse space

two back up emergency generators assure continuity of company operations 
additionally  the company s corporate complex has a  square foot learning center which includes a seat auditorium and a  square foot training lab  both equipped with closed circuit and satellite television broadcast capability allowing live surgery broadcasts from and to anywhere in the world 
the learning center provides visiting cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic surgeons with a hands on training environment for surgical and implantation techniques for the company s technology platforms 
human tissue processing the human tissue processing laboratory is responsible for the processing and preservation of human cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue for transplant 
this laboratory contains approximately  square feet with a suite of eight clean rooms 
currently there are approximately technicians employed in this area  and the laboratory is staffed for hours per day  days per year 
in the laboratory packaged approximately  human allografts 
the current processing level is estimated to be at about of total capacity 
the volume of tissue processed is currently constrained by the availability of tissue 
to increase the current processing levels  the company could increase the number of employees  expand its third shift  and add equipment 
bioglue bioglue is presently manufactured at the company s headquarters facility 
the laboratory contains approximately  square feet  including a suite of six clean rooms 
currently  there are technicians employed in this area 
the laboratory has a potential annual capacity of approximately million cartridges or syringes of bioglue 
the current processing level is about of total capacity 
to produce at full capacity levels  the company would need to increase the number of employees  add work shifts  and install automated filling and pouching equipment 
bioprosthetic cardiovascular and vascular devices the bioprosthesis laboratory at the company s headquarters facility is responsible for the manufacturing of the cryolife o brien stentless porcine heart valve and the synergraft bovine vascular graft

records are maintained as to the consignees of products to track product performance and to facilitate product removals or corrections  if necessary 
each manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspection by the fda and lrqa to independently review the company s compliance with its systems and regulatory requirements 
preservation services the company also employs a comprehensive quality assurance program in all of its tissue processing activities 
the company is subject to donor eligibility and good tissue practice regulations  as well as other fda quality system regulations  and iso requirements 
the company s quality assurance program begins with the development and implementation of training courses for the employees of procurement agencies 
to assure uniformity of procurement practices among the tissue recovery teams  the company provides procurement protocols  transport packages  and tissue transport liquids to the procurement organizations 
the company also periodically audits procurement organizations to ensure and enhance best procurement practices 
upon receipt by the company  each tissue is assigned a unique control number that provides traceability of tissue from procurement through the processing and preservation processes  and ultimately to the tissue recipient 
samples from each tissue donor are subjected to a variety of serologic tests to screen for infectious diseases 
samples of some tissues are also provided for pathology testing 
following dissection of the tissue to be cryopreserved  dissected tissue is treated with proprietary antimicrobial solutions and aseptically packaged 
each tissue must be free of detectable microbial contaminants by two independent tests before being distributed 
the materials and solutions used by the company in processing tissue must meet the company s quality standards and be approved by quality assurance personnel for use in processing 
throughout tissue processing  detailed records of the tissues  materials  and processes are maintained and reviewed by quality assurance personnel 
the states of georgia  new york  florida  maryland  and california annually license the company s tissue processing facilities as facilities that process  store  and distribute human tissue for implantation 
the regulatory bodies of these states perform inspections as required of the facilities to ensure compliance with state law and regulations 
human tissue processed by the company must also comply with fda regulations for determining donor eligibility and for processing human cell and tissue products for implantation under current good tissue practices cgtps 
the fda periodically audits the company s processing facilities for compliance with those requirements 
see fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices other fda correspondence and notices above for a discussion of recent inspections 
patents  licenses  and other proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  confidentiality agreements and security procedures to protect its proprietary products  processing technology  trade secrets  and know how 
the company believes that its patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and technology licensing rights provide it with important competitive advantages 
the company owns or has licensed rights to us patents and foreign patents  including patents relating to its technology for human cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue preservation  tissue revitalization prior to freezing  tissue transport  bioglue  act  and packaging 
the company has approximately pending us patent applications and pending foreign applications that relate to areas including the company s cryopreservation  protein hydrogel technologies  and other areas 
there can be no assurance that any patents pending will result in issued patents 
the remaining duration of the company s issued patents ranges from to years 
the company has licensed from third parties certain technologies that call for the payment of both developmental milestones and royalties based on revenues  when and if such products or services are approved for marketing 
the loss of these licenses could adversely affect the company s ability to successfully develop certain technologies 
there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in any of the company s existing or future patents will provide competitive advantages for the company s products  processes  and technologies or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
to the extent that any of the company s products or services are not effectively patent protected  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
under current law  patent applications in the us and patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
the right to a patent in the us is attributable to the first to invent  not the first to file a patent application 
the company cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that its products do not infringe any patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company may incur substantial legal fees in defending against a patent infringement claim or in asserting claims against third parties 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from marketing certain of its products or could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of such patents or be required to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
the company s failure to obtain these licenses or to redesign its products or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in august the company settled litigation with colorado state university research foundation csurf over the ownership of the company s synergraft technology 
the settlement extinguished csurf s claims to the company s synergraft technology 
the settlement payment terms included a nonrefundable prepaid royalty of  to be applied to earned royalties as they accrue through march as of december  the remaining balance of the prepaid royalty was  the company does not expect to pay any additional royalties to csurf 
the company has entered into confidentiality agreements with its employees and several of its consultants and third party vendors to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the obligations of employees of the company and third parties with whom the company has entered into confidentiality agreements will effectively prevent disclosure of the company s confidential information or provide meaningful protection for the company s confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by the company s competitors 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce patents and trademarks of the company  or to protect trade secrets and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such litigation 
in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us competition implantable biomedical devices for use as surgical adhesives and sealants the company competes with many domestic and foreign medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies 
in the surgical adhesive and surgical sealant area  the company competes primarily with baxter healthcare s tisseel  floseal  and coseal products 
additionally  closure medical  a subsidiary of johnson johnson is under fda review for a surgical adhesive for approval in vascular sealing 
the company currently competes with these products based on the products features  such as strength and ease of use 
competitive products may also be under development by other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  research and development  regulatory and clinical  manufacturing  marketing and sales  and personnel resources than the company 
these competitors may also have greater experience in developing products  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing such products 
certain of these competitors may obtain patent protection  approval or clearance by the fda or foreign countries  or product commercialization earlier than the company  any of which could materially adversely affect the company 
furthermore  if the company commences significant commercial sales of its products  it will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities 
other recently developed technologies or procedures are  or may in the future be  the basis of competitive products 
there can be no assurance that the company s current competitors or other parties will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use  or more economical than those which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and non competitive in these fields 
in such event  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see part i  item a  risk factors risks related to cryolife and its industry rapid technological change could cause services and products to become obsolete 
cryopreserved human tissues and bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices the company faces competition from at least one for profit company and several non profit tissue banks that cryopreserve and distribute human tissue  as well as from companies that market mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  and synthetic vascular grafts for implantation 
many established companies  some with resources greater than those of the company  are engaged in manufacturing  marketing  and selling alternatives to cryopreserved human tissue 
management believes that it competes with other entities that cryopreserve human tissue on the basis of technology  customer service  and quality assurance 
following the fda order in  the company experienced a decrease in the procurement and processing of human tissue  a decrease in cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue shipments  and the lack of orthopaedic tissue shipments for a period of time 
the company s competitors have been favorably impacted and the company believes it has lost some market share since the fda order in the interruption in the company s services  and the changes made to the company s preservation services  which have had the effect of substantially increasing the tissue processing and release times and reducing the yield of implantable tissue per donor  have made it difficult for the company to regain a profitable level of revenues 
management believes that the human heart valves cryopreserved by the company  as compared to mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  compete on the factors set forth above  as well as by providing a tissue that is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions  such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction  valve replacements for women in their child bearing years  and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis 
generally  for each procedure that may utilize vascular or orthopaedic human tissue that the company cryopreserves  there are alternative treatments 
often  as in the case of veins and ligaments  these alternatives include the repair  partial removal  or complete removal of the damaged tissue and may utilize other tissues from the patients themselves or synthetic products 
the attending physician  in consultation with the patient  makes the selection of treatment choices 
any newly developed treatments will also compete with the use of tissue cryopreserved by the company 
human and stentless porcine heart valves 
alternatives to human heart valves cryopreserved by the company include mechanical valves  porcine valves  and valves constructed from bovine pericardium 
st 
jude medical  inc is the leading supplier of mechanical heart valves  and has a marketing and distribution arrangement with a non profit tissue bank for supplies of cryopreserved human heart valves 
medtronic  inc is the leading supplier of porcine heart valves 
edwards life sciences  inc is the leading supplier of bovine pericardium heart valves 
in addition management believes that at least three domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for human heart valves in competition with the company 
the company presently distributes its stentless porcine heart valve only outside the us this stentless porcine heart valve competes with mechanical valves  stented and stentless porcine valves  human heart valves  and processed bovine pericardium heart valves 
the company is aware of at least five other companies that offer porcine and bovine pericardium heart valves 
human vascular tissue 
there are a number of providers of synthetic alternatives to veins cryopreserved by the company and those alternatives are available primarily in medium and large diameters 
currently  management believes that there are at least three other providers  northwest tissue centers  regeneration technologies  inc  and lifenet  of cryopreserved human vascular tissue in competition with the company 
companies offering either synthetic or allograft products may enter this market in the future 
human orthopaedic tissue 
the company ceased processing orthopaedic tissue in august as a result of the fda order and began limited processing of orthopaedic tissue in late february the company began shipment of these orthopaedic tissues processed since february with the shipment of non boned orthopaedic tissues in may and boned orthopaedic tissues in august during september  in response to a reported infection  the company halted the shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues in order to conduct an additional review of the systems in place to process and release boned orthopaedic tissues 
in december the company resumed shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues after the completion of its review 
the company s historic competition in the area of orthopaedic tissue has varied according to the tissue involved 
when transplantation is indicated  the historic principal competition for tendons and meniscus cryopreserved by the company has been either freeze dried or twice frozen human connective tissues 
these alternative allografts are distributed by more than ten tissue banks 
government regulation us federal regulation of medical devices because bioglue and certain human heart valves are  and other company products may in the future be  regulated as medical devices  the company and these products are subject to the provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdca and implementing regulations 
pursuant to the fdca  the fda regulates the manufacture  distribution  labeling  and promotion of medical devices in the us also various foreign countries in which the company s products are  or may be  distributed impose additional regulatory requirements 
the fdca provides that  unless exempted by regulation  medical devices may not be distributed in the us unless they have been approved or cleared for marketing by the fda 
there are two review procedures by which medical devices can receive such approval or clearance 
some products may qualify for clearance to be marketed under a section k k procedure  in which the manufacturer provides a premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing the product  and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed k product ie  that it has the same intended use  it is as safe and effective as a legally marketed k device  and it does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device 
in some cases  the submission must include data from clinical studies 
marketing may commence when the fda issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence 
if the product does not qualify for the k procedure either because it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed k device or because it is a class iii device required by the fdca and implementing regulations to have an approved application for premarket approval pma the fda must approve a pma application before marketing can begin 
pma applications must demonstrate  among other matters  that the medical device is safe and effective 
a pma application is typically a complex submission  usually including the results of human clinical studies  and preparing an application is a detailed and time consuming process 
once a pma application has been submitted  the fda s review may be lengthy and may include requests for additional data 
by statute and regulation  the fda may take days to review a pma application although such time may be extended 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a pma application will be reviewed within days or that a pma application will be approved by the fda 
the fdca also provides for an investigational device exemption ide which authorizes distribution for clinical evaluation of devices that lack a pma or k clearance 
devices subject to an ide are subject to various restrictions imposed by the fda 
the number of patients that may be treated with the device is limited  as is the number of institutions at which the device may be used 
patients must give informed consent to be treated with an investigational device 
the device must be labeled that it is for investigational use and may not be advertised or otherwise promoted  and the price charged for the device may be limited 
unexpected adverse experiences must be reported to the fda 
under certain circumstances  the fda may grant a humanitarian device exemption hde 
hde s are granted by the fda in an attempt to encourage the development of medical devices for use in the treatment of rare conditions that affect small patient populations 
an approval by the fda exempts such devices from full compliance with clinical study requirements for pma 
the fdca requires all medical device manufacturers and distributors to register with the fda annually and to provide the fda with a list of those medical devices that they distribute commercially 
the fdca also requires manufacturers of medical devices to comply with labeling requirements and to manufacture devices in accordance with quality system regulations  which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain their documents in a prescribed manner with respect to good manufacturing practices  design  document production  process  labeling and packaging controls  process validation  and other quality control activities 
the fda s medical device reporting regulation requires that a device manufacturer provide information to the fda on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its products  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the fda s medical device tracking regulation requires the adoption of a method of device tracking by manufacturers of life sustaining or implantable products  the failure of which would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences  if the fda issues an order to do so 
the manufacturer must adopt methods to ensure that such devices can be traced from the manufacturing facility to the ultimate user  the patient 
the fda further requires that certain medical devices not cleared for marketing in the us follow certain procedures before they are exported 
the fda inspects medical device manufacturers and distributors and has authority to seize noncomplying medical devices  to enjoin and or to impose civil penalties on manufacturers and distributors marketing non complying medical devices  to criminally prosecute violators  and to order recalls in certain instances 
human heart valves 
the company s human heart valves became subject to regulation by the fda in june  when the fda published a notice stating that human heart valves were class iii medical devices under the fdca 
the june notice provided that distribution of human heart valves for transplantation would violate the fdca unless they were the subject of an approved pma or ide on or before august  on october  the fda announced in the federal register that neither an approved application for pma nor an ide is required for processors and distributors who had marketed heart valve allografts before june  this action by the fda resulted in the allograft heart valves being classified as class ii medical devices and has removed them from clinical trial status 
it also allowed the company to distribute such valves to cardiovascular surgeons throughout the us on may   with the promulgation of the final rule for cgtps  the fda reclassified human heart valves  processed on or after may   as human tissue subject to that rule 
as discussed in fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices  the company has filed a k premarket notification with the fda for the cryovalve sg and has received three letters from the fda requesting that additional information be provided to support the k submission 
cryolife has responded to some of the requests  anticipates responding to some of the additional requests  and has initiated an appeal of others through administrative procedures 
porcine heart valves 
porcine heart valves are class iii medical devices  and fda approval of a pma is required prior to commercial distribution of such valves in the us the porcine heart valves currently marketed by the company have not been approved by the fda for commercial distribution in the us but may be manufactured in the us and exported to foreign countries if the valves meet the specifications of the foreign purchaser  do not conflict with the laws of and are approved by the country to which they will be exported  and the fda determines that their exportation is not contrary to the public health and safety 
bioglue 
the fda regulates bioglue as a class iii medical device 
in december the company received fda approval for bioglue as an adjunct to sutures and staples for use in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels 
prior to this approval  the company received an hde in december for bioglue for use as an adjunct in repair of acute thoracic aortic dissections 
us federal regulation of human tissue the company s non valved conduits  vascular grafts  and orthopaedic tissues are not currently subject to regulation under the fdca as medical devices 
see fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices other fda correspondence and notices regarding correspondence from the fda about cardiovascular and vascular tissues processed with the synergraft technology 
historically  heart valves were one of a small number of processed human tissues over which the fda asserted medical device jurisdiction 
concerns with the transmission of hiv and hepatitis b led the fda to issue an interim rule in december as an emergency measure to protect the public from any human tissue that had incomplete or no documentation ascertaining its freedom from communicable diseases 
the fda modified the regulation and reissued it as a new rule  effective january  which focused on donor screening and testing to prevent the introduction  transmission  and spread of hiv and and hepatitis b and c 
the final rule set minimal requirements to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases from human tissue used for transplantation 
the rule defines human tissue as any tissue derived from a human body which is i intended for administration to another human for the diagnosis  cure  mitigation  treatment  or prevention of any condition or disease and ii recovered  processed  stored  or distributed by methods not intended to change tissue function or characteristics 
the fda definition excludes  among other things  tissue that currently is regulated as a human drug  biological product  or medical device and excludes kidney  liver  heart  lung  pancreas  or any other vascularized human organ 
the current regulations applicable to human tissues include requirements for donor suitability discussed above  processing standards  establishment registration  and product listing 
in may the fda published a new final rule governing the eligibility of donors of human cell and tissue products 
this rule expands previous requirements for testing and screening for risks of communicable diseases that could be spread by the use of these tissues 
in november the fda published a new final rule governing the procedures and processes related to the manufacture of human cell and tissue products under the cgtps 
both the new donor eligibility rule and the cgtp rule became effective on may  and designate human heart valves  processed on or after may   as human tissue rather than medical devices 
it is likely that the fda s regulation of processed human tissue will continue to evolve in the future 
complying with fda regulatory requirements or obtaining required fda approvals or clearances may entail significant time delays and expenses or may not be possible  any of which may have a material adverse effect on the company as discussed in fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices  the company filed an administrative appeal on an rfd submitted in october regarding synergraft processed cardiovascular tissue  including the cryovein sg 
on october  cryolife was informed that the fda had denied the appeal and that cryolife will be unable to distribute cryovein tissues with the synergraft technology until further submissions and fda clearances are granted 
the company is evaluating whether it will file and seek a premarket approval for cryovein sg or discontinue the cryovein sg 
possible other fda regulation other products and processes under development by the company are likely to be subject to regulation by the fda 
some may be classified as medical devices or human cells and tissue products  while others may be classified as drugs or biological products or subject to a regulatory scheme that the fda may adopt in the future 
regulation of drugs and biological products is substantially similar to regulation of class iii medical devices 
obtaining fda approval to market these products is likely to be a time consuming and expensive process  and there can be no assurance that any of these products will ever receive fda approval  if required  to be marketed 
nota regulation the company s activities in processing and transporting human hearts and certain other organs are also subject to federal regulation under the national organ transplant act nota  which makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire  receive  or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce 
nota excludes from the definition of valuable consideration reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of a human organ 
the purpose of this statutory provision is to allow for compensation for legitimate services 
the company believes that to the extent its activities are subject to nota  it meets this statutory provision relating to the reasonableness of its charges 
there can be no assurance  however  that restrictive interpretations of nota will not be adopted in the future that would call into question one or more aspects of the company s methods of charging for its preservation services 
state licensing requirements some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the processing  transportation  and storage of human organs and tissue 
the activities engaged in by the company require it to be licensed as a clinical laboratory and tissue bank under georgia  new york  california  maryland  and florida law 
the company has such licenses  and the company believes it is in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations relating to clinical laboratories and tissue banks that store  process  and distribute human tissue designed to be used for medical purposes in human beings 
there can be no assurance  however  that more restrictive state laws or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could adversely affect the company s operations 
certain employees of the company have obtained other required licenses 
foreign approval requirements sales of medical devices and biological products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to commercial distribution of the product in those countries 
the time required to obtain foreign approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the eea recognizes a single approval  called a ce mark  which allows for distribution of an approved product throughout the eea member state countries  european union eu countries  and european free trade association efta countries without additional general applications in each country 
however  individual eea members reserve the right to require additional labeling or information to address particular patient safety issues prior to allowing marketing 
third parties called notified bodies award the ce mark 
these notified bodies are approved and subject to review by the competent authorities of their respective countries 
a number of countries outside of the eea accept the ce mark in lieu of marketing submissions as an addendum to that country s application process 
the company has been issued ce marks for its cryolife o brien porcine heart valve  bioglue  and synergraft model vascular grafts 
the company s porcine heart valves and synergraft model vascular graft may be exported to more than countries outside the us environmental matters the company s tissue processing activities generate some biomedical wastes consisting primarily of human and animal pathological and biological wastes  including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures 
the biomedical wastes generated by the company are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes generated by the company 
the company contracts with third parties for transport  treatment  and disposal of biomedical waste 
although the company believes it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the us environmental protection agency and the georgia department of natural resources  environmental protection division  the failure by the company to comply fully with any such regulations could result in an imposition of penalties  fines  or sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
employees as of january  the company had approximately employees 
these employees included seven persons with phd degrees  one with an phd degree  and one with a do degree 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage or interruption due to labor disputes

item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to the company s business overview cryolife has faced extraordinary challenges since it received  on august   the fda order calling for the retention  recall  and or destruction of all non valved cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue processed by cryolife since october  the recall resulted in the destruction of much of cryolife s tissue  required that it adjust revenue for tissue recall returns  curtailed its processing activities  subjected it to intense fda scrutiny and additional regulatory requirements that increased costs while cryolife suffered decreased revenues due to lack of processing ability  and decreased market demand for its services 
during the same year cryolife was the subject of intense adverse media attention in connection with allegations that tissue processed by cryolife had infected a man in minnesota and caused his death 
cryolife also became the subject of shareholders class action and derivative shareholder suits  which were not resolved until the last half of product liability cases and claims increased to unprecedented numbers for cryolife  using all of its related insurance policy year insurance coverage and taxing its other resources 
while many cases and claims have been settled  several remain unresolved 
the sec has initiated and continues to pursue a formal investigation 
these challenges have affected company revenues  increased its costs to process tissues and its operating expenses  and strained management resources 
although cryolife resumed processing and distribution of the types of tissues subject to the fda recall and resolved many of the product liability suits pending against it  the foregoing factors will continue to challenge cryolife in its efforts to increase revenues and return to profitability 
no assurances can be made that cryolife will succeed in those efforts in a timely fashion 
the company has experienced operating losses and negative cash flow 
the company must address the underlying causes 
due principally to factors mentioned above the company has suffered net losses and generated negative operating cash flow each year in the three year period ended december  and anticipates net losses and negative cash flow from operations for the full year of the company expects that the following factors will continue to have an adverse effect on earnings and cash flows during o the anticipated lower preservation service revenues as compared to preservation service revenues prior to the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events  o the high cost of human tissue preservation services as a percent of revenue  as compared to the period prior to the fda order  as a result of lower tissue processing volumes and changes in processing methods  which increased the cost of processing human tissue and decreased yields of implantable tissue per donor  o an expected use of cash related to the defense and resolution of lawsuits and claims  and o the legal and professional costs related to ongoing fda compliance 
the company s long term earnings  liquidity  and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including o the success of bioglue and other products using related technology  o the company s ability to increase the level of tissue procurement and demand for its tissue preservation services  o the company s ability to reestablish sufficient margins on its tissue preservation services in the face of increased processing costs by improving yields and increasing prices  o the company s spending levels on its research and development activities  including research studies  to develop and support its service and product pipeline  o the timing and cost of resolving the remaining outstanding product liability lawsuits and other claims  o to a lesser degree  the company s success at resolving the issues with the fda regarding processing of human tissue using the synergraft technology 
if the company is unable to address the causes of its operating losses and negative cash flows  it will need to raise additional capital which may not be available or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if the company is unable to address these issues and continues to experience negative cash flows  the company anticipates that it will require additional financing or seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings  or other sources of capital to meet liquidity and capital requirements 
additional funds may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
issuance of equity capital may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
the company s review of potential strategies may not be productive and the outcome of this process is uncertain 
cryolife recently retained piper jaffray co 
to assist the company s management and board of directors in identifying and evaluating potential strategies to enhance shareholder value 
the company is uncertain as to what impact any particular strategy may have on its operating results or stock price  if accomplished  or whether any material changes or transactions will even occur as a result of this review 
other uncertainties and risks relating to the review of potential strategies include o the review of potential strategies may disrupt the company s operations and divert management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial position  or results of operations  o the perceived uncertainties as to the company s future direction may result in the loss of  or failure to attract  customers  employees or business partners  o the process of reviewing potential strategies may be more time consuming and expensive than currently anticipated  and o cryolife may not be able to identify new potential strategies  or variations of existing strategies  that are worth pursuing  and even if strategies are identified that are believed to be worth pursuing  the company may not successfully execute any strategy or strategies undertaken 
even if cryolife is successful  the effort may not enhance shareholder value 
the company s revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on its ability to borrow  which could make it more difficult to borrow needed funds 
the credit agreement places limitations on the amount that the company may borrow  and includes various affirmative and negative covenants 
among these financial covenants is a requirement that cryolife maintain quarterly either o minimum aggregate borrowing capacity plus cash and cash equivalents in excess of million the cash test or o achieve an increasing level of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  as defined in the credit agreement ebitda  a bioglue gross margin greater than for the preceding twelve months as calculated quarterly  and cash and cash equivalents defined as cash and low risk marketable securities that are held in an account in which the lender has a perfected security interest and borrowing capacity defined below in excess of million the ebitda test  borrowing capacity is defined as the following o the lesser of o million or o of the appraised value of the business of cryolife reduced by the lender s reserves for credit exposure associated with other bank products provided by the lender to cryolife  o minus all outstanding obligations under the credit agreement including outstanding letters of credit  o minus the aggregate amount of any trade payables of the company aged in excess of their historical levels and all book overdrafts of the company in excess of their historical practices 
current forecasts of company ebitda  coupled with the uncertainties inherent in the company s operating cash flows  make compliance with the ebitda test uncertain 
accordingly  the company anticipates that compliance with this financial covenant will be dependent on its ability to satisfy the cash test 
judgments and settlements arising out of product liability or other claims  negative operating cash flow  and other factors  which adversely affect available cash resources may adversely affect compliance with the cash test 
failure to meet this and other covenants may result in breach of the credit agreement  acceleration of payment of outstanding borrowings  and loss of borrowing capacity under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes conditions on incurring new indebtedness and limitations on cash dividends 
these restrictions and conditions could make it more difficult or more expensive to borrow money 
the company is significantly dependent on its revenues from bioglue and is subject to a variety of risks affecting this product 
bioglue has become a significant source of the company s revenues 
should the product be the subject of adverse developments with regard to its safety or efficacy  reimbursement practices  or if a competitor s product obtains greater acceptance  or the company s rights to manufacture and market this are challenged  the result could be a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
furthermore  the company has only two suppliers of bovine serum albumen  which is necessary for the manufacture of bioglue 
the company presently has only one supplier for its new syringe 
the loss of one or more of these suppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to manufacture and sell bioglue 
there can be no assurance that cryolife would be able to replace any such loss on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda order and subsequent fda activity continue to adversely impact cryolife s business  including reducing demand for its services and increasing processing costs 
on august  cryolife received an order from the fda calling for the retention  recall  and or destruction of all non valved cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue processed by cryolife at its headquarters since october  based upon allegations that cryolife violated fda regulations in its handling of such tissue and alleged contamination through cryolife s processing of such tissue that resulted in post transplant infections including one death 
a significant portion of cryolife s current revenues is derived from the preservation of human tissues 
revenues from human tissue preservation services for the six months ended june   the last period ending prior to the issuance of the fda order  were of cryolife s revenues  or approximately million 
during these revenues were approximately million or of revenues 
the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and resulting adverse publicity had a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
cryolife has experienced decreases in revenues and incurred losses and cryolife may not generate sufficient cash from operations  to fund its capital requirements over the long term 
cryolife has continued to experience a reduced demand for its tissues due to the adverse publicity generated from the recall and from decisions by implanting physicians or risk managers at implanting institutions to use human tissue services provided by cryolife s competitors 
in addition  as a result of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and changes in cryolife s processing  the costs of such processing have increased and are likely to remain high as compared to cost levels prior to the fda order 
these high costs have had a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  results of operations and financial position and will continue to do so 
the success of cryolife s tissue preservation services depends upon  among other factors  the availability of sufficient quantities of tissue from human donors 
any material reduction in the supply of donated human tissue would restrict cryolife s growth and adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial conditions 
cryolife relies primarily upon the efforts of third party procurement agencies and tissue banks most of which are not for profit and others to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue 
because of the adverse publicity associated with the fda order and subsequent fda activity and uncertainty regarding future tissue processing  some procurement agencies stopped sending tissue to cryolife for processing 
as a result  the company s processing has been constrained in part due to availability of tissue 
if cryolife is unable to obtain tissues from procurement agencies that have ceased sending tissue to cryolife for processing  to develop new sources  or to increase the tissues shipped from its current suppliers  cryolife may be unable to obtain adequate supplies of donated tissues to operate profitably 
revenue from orthopaedic tissue preservation services may not return to acceptable levels 
cryolife has received much lower revenues from the preservation of orthopaedic tissue since august  for the year ended december   human tissue preservation service revenues for orthopaedic tissue were million  which represented of cryolife s revenues 
for the six months ended june   the last period ending prior to the fda order revenues for preservation services for orthopaedic tissue were million  which represented of cryolife s revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues from preservation services for orthopaedic tissue were million  which represented of cryolife s revenues 
the demand for orthopaedic tissue from cryolife may not reach acceptable levels  even though cryolife has resumed processing after altering the company s procedures  has introduced a process for sterilizing such tissue  and has begun offering osteochondral tissue 
as a result  this portion of cryolife s business may only continue at substantially reduced levels or may be discontinued 
either of these results could result in a continued significant decrease in cryolife s preservation service revenues and have an adverse impact on its ability to return to profitability 
physicians have been and may continue to be reluctant to implant cryolife s preserved tissues 
some physicians or implanting institutions have been reluctant to choose cryolife s preserved tissues for use in implantation  due to a perception that they may not be safe or to a belief that the implanting physician or hospital may be subject to a heightened liability risk if cryolife s tissues are used 
in addition  for similar reasons  some hospital risk managers have not allowed implanting surgeons to utilize cryolife s tissues where alternatives are available 
several risk managers and physicians have refused to use the company s products due to these concerns 
these conditions have materially and adversely affected demand for cryolife s processed human tissues 
if these conditions persist cryolife s results of operations and cash flow will continue to be adversely affected 
if additional implanting hospitals or physicians representing significant revenues refuse to use tissues preserved by the company  and the company is unable to replace the revenues lost  preservation service revenues and profits would be materially adversely affected 
cryolife s products and the tissues it processes allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients using its products or tissues and the company has been and may be exposed to product liability claims and additional regulatory scrutiny as a result 
the processing  preservation and distribution of human allograft tissue  bovine tissue products  porcine tissue products and the manufacture and sale of medical devices entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and have resulted and may result in product liability claims against the company 
plaintiffs have asserted that the company s tissue or medical devices have caused a variety of injuries including death 
when patients are injured  die or have adverse results following procedures using the company s tissue or medical devices  the company has been and may be sued and its insurance coverage has been and may be inadequate 
adverse judgments and settlements in excess of the company s available insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of medical complications that are alleged to have been caused by or occur in connection with medical procedures involving the company s tissue or medical devices  the company has been and may be subject to additional fda and other regulatory scrutiny and inspections 
for example  shortly after the fda order the fda posted a notice  now archived  on its website stating its concerns regarding cryolife s heart valve preservation services 
as a result  some surgeons and hospitals decided not to use cryolife s heart valves 
cautionary statements from the fda or other regulators regarding the company s tissue services or products  or negative reviews from the fda or regulators of the company s processing and manufacturing facilities has and may decrease demand for the company s tissue services or products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial position 
in addition to the recall resulting from the fda order  the company has and in the future may have to suspend the distribution of particular types of tissues as a result of reported adverse events in connection with its tissues 
for example  during september  in response to a reported infection  the company halted the shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues in order to conduct an additional review of the systems in place to process and release boned orthopaedic tissues 
suspension of the distribution of  or recall of  the company s tissue services or medical products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profits 
adverse publicity may reduce demand for products and services not affected by the fda recall 
even though cryolife s heart valve tissues  bioglue and bioprosthetic devices were not included in the fda order  there is a possibility that surgeons or risk managers at institutions that use such products may be reluctant to use such products because of the adverse publicity associated with the fda order 
decreased demand for such products  particularly bioglue  could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  results of operations and financial position 
cryolife may be unable to address the concerns raised by the fda in its form notices of observations 
the fda issued form notices of observations in february and october  in february  and in august among the issues raised in the most recent were the process validations associated with the cryovalve sg  complaint handling and reporting  and root cause analysis of certain microbial testing results 
if cryolife s responses to the fda s observations contained in these notices  or any future notices  are deemed unsatisfactory  the fda could take further action  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
further action by the fda could include additional recalls of products  requiring the company to do additional testing  beginning to require prescriptions for products where they are not currently required  halting the shipping or processing of products  or requiring additional approvals for marketing the company s products or services 
the fda has notified cryolife of its belief that marketing of cryovalve sg and cryovein sg require additional regulatory submissions and or approvals 
during the fda notified cryolife that the application of the synergraft technology to allograft heart valves cryovalve sg was considered to be a major manufacturing change requiring a k submission 
cryolife submitted a k for cryovalve sg and has received three requests for additional information from fda 
while most of the requested information has been provided  cryolife is seeking to resolve certain other requests  involving bench testing  animal testing  and additional clinical trials  through administrative procedures at the fda 
resolution of this matter could be time consuming and expensive  depending in large part on the success of the company s efforts through the fda s administrative processes 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with cryolife or that the cryovalve sg k will be cleared in the foreseeable future  if at all 
if the company is unable to resolve this issue  it may not be able to offer the services 
the fda has also determined that non valved cardiovascular cryovein tissues processed using cryolife s synergraft technology should be regulated as medical devices and will require additional premarket approval authorization for continued distribution of these tissues 
cryolife s appeal of this the designation was denied 
there can be no assurance that the designation of synergraft cardiovascular tissue will be resolved favorably 
if cryolife is unable to resolve this matter  it may not be able to offer these services 
regulatory action outside of the us has affected cryolife s business in the past and may also affect cryolife s business in the future 
after the issuance of the fda order  health canada also issued a recall on the same types of tissue 
in addition other countries have inquired as to the tissues exported by the company  although these inquiries are now  to cryolife s knowledge  complete 
in the event other countries raise additional regulatory concerns  cryolife may be unable to export tissues to those countries 
revenue from international human tissue preservation services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cryolife also offers bioglue and other products for use in other countries 
violation of government regulations could result in loss of revenues and customers and additional expense to attain compliance 
the facilities and processes used by the company are subject to regulation by the fda and some states 
cryolife s facilities are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda and state regulatory authorities to ensure their compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to sanctions  such as written observations of deficiencies made following inspections  warning letters  product recalls  fines  product seizures and consent decrees  which would be made available to the public 
such actions and publicity could affect the company s ability to sell its products and services 
in the past  cryolife has received notifications and warning letters from the fda relating to deficiencies in its compliance with fda requirements 
the company was required to take measures to respond 
cryolife also was subject to the fda order  which had a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the fda or state regulatory authorities will not request that it take additional steps to correct deficiencies in compliance raised by the fda or state regulatory authorities in the future 
correction of any such deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business 
cryolife is the subject of an ongoing sec investigation 
as previously disclosed  there is an ongoing sec investigation 
the sec notified the company in july that the inquiry became a formal investigation in june cryolife has cooperated with this investigation both before and after issuance of the formal order of investigation in june  and intends to continue doing so 
cryolife voluntarily reported the names of six employees and former employees to the sec in december after discovering they had apparently sold cryolife shares on august   before trading was halted pending cryolife s press release reporting the fda order 
these individuals were not and are not executive officers of cryolife 
the formal order of investigation indicates that the sec s scope includes whether  during  among other things  cryolife or others may have traded while in possession of material nonpublic information  made or caused to be made false or misleading statements or omissions in press releases and sec filings  and failed to maintain accurate records and adequate controls 
the investigation could also encompass matters not specifically identified in the formal order 
on september   the sec announced that it had commenced proceedings against several of the former and current employees cryolife had reported and certain of their spouses for alleged illegal insider trading arising out of their august  trading activities 
certain of those proceedings resulted in settlements with the sec  while other proceedings remain pending 
other than receiving a report of that activity  the sec has had no discussions with cryolife representatives as to whether or against whom it will seek additional relief  or the nature of any relief that may be sought 
at present  cryolife is unable to predict the ultimate focus or outcome of the investigation  or when it will be completed 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s reputation  business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
cryolife s insurance coverage has been and may be either unavailable or insufficient 
the company s products and the tissues it processes allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients using the company s products or tissues and the company has been and may be exposed to product liability claims 
following the fda order  product liability lawsuits increased to unprecedented numbers for cryolife 
these claims involved assertions that infections and related morbidity  including death  were the result of inadequacies in cryolife s procedures 
cryolife maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
as of february  the company had two outstanding product liability lawsuits against the company that are covered by the insurance policy 
the company believes its insurance policy to be adequate to defend against the covered lawsuits in this time period 
additionally  the company has four outstanding product liability lawsuits against the company that are not covered by insurance policies as the claims were asserted against the company in periods after the coverage in the related incident year had lapsed 
additional uninsured claims may be filed in the future 
other product liability claims have been asserted against the company that have not resulted in lawsuits 
the company is monitoring these claims 
cryolife s december  consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability in the amount of approximately million for the estimated cost of resolving these claims 
the amounts recorded were estimates  and do not reflect actual settlement arrangements or final judgments  the latter of which could include punitive damages  nor do they represent cash set aside for the purpose of making payments 
cryolife s december  consolidated balance sheet also reflects a million liability  included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million on the consolidated balance sheet  for the estimated cost of resolving unreported product liability claims 
cryolife s product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies product liability claims for a description of the company s accounting treatment for product liability claims 
several putative class action lawsuits were filed in july through september against the company and certain officers of the company  alleging violations of sections b of the securities exchange act of based on a series of purportedly materially false and misleading statements to the market 
on july  the company reached an agreement in principle to settle the securities class action lawsuit and the settlement became final later in the year 
in august and january purported shareholder derivative actions were filed 
these lawsuits  which named the company as a nominal defendant  alleged that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the company by causing or allowing the company to engage in certain inappropriate practices that caused the company to suffer damages 
a settlement was also reached in those cases and became final in the company s insurance proceeds were insufficient to fund the costs of defending and settling the securities class action and derivative lawsuits 
if cryolife is unsuccessful in arranging acceptable settlements of product liability claims  securities class action  or derivative claims  there may not be sufficient insurance coverage and liquid assets to meet these obligations 
additionally  if one or more claims in which cryolife is a defendant  whether now pending or hereafter arising  should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  such verdict s could exceed cryolife s available insurance coverage and liquid assets 
if cryolife is unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve the outstanding or any future claims  it will have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of cryolife 
further  if the costs of pending or unreported but incurred product liability claims exceed cryolife s current estimates  its business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
satisfactory levels of insurance coverage may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the future and if obtained  it could be very expensive 
due in part to the current litigation  the fda order and subsequent fda activity  cryolife may be unable to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage in the future  causing cryolife to be subject to additional future exposure from product liability claims 
additionally  if insurance coverage is obtained  the insurance rates may be significantly higher than in the past  and may provide less coverage  which may adversely impact cryolife s profitability 
for example  cryolife paid a higher fee for its policy year product liability insurance coverage  which also had a higher retention level and a lower overall limit 
unlike the prior year s policy  the policy did not cover any claims  which arose prior to the insurance policy year 
the policy was a two year claims made policy  covering claims arising since the commencement of the policy year 
the company s current insurance policy is a three year claims made policy covering claims since the commencement of the policy year and expires in march the company is currently evaluating with prospective insurers available coverage and cost 
the company presently expects that there could be increases in both cost and retention  although it also expects coverage to be a four year claims made policy 
there is no assurance the company will be successful in obtaining satisfactory coverage upon expiration of its current coverage 
intense competition affects cryolife s ability to recover from the fda order 
cryolife faces competition from other companies that process human tissue  as well as companies that market mechanical valves and synthetic and animal tissue for implantation and companies that market surgical adhesives and surgical sealants 
management believes that at least three domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for allograft heart valves and many companies offer processed porcine heart valves and mechanical heart valves 
a few companies dominate portions of the mechanical  porcine and bovine heart valve markets  including st 
jude medical  inc  medtronic  inc  and edwards life sciences 
cryolife s bioglue product competes with other surgical adhesives and surgical sealants  including baxter healthcare s tisseel  floseal  and coseal products 
cryolife is also aware that a few companies have surgical adhesive products under development 
for example  closure medical is in clinical trials for a surgical adhesive for approval in vascular sealing that could compete with bioglue in certain applications 
other competitive products may also be under development by other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies 
many of cryolife s competitors have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  and marketing resources than cryolife and are well established in their markets 
cryolife increased fees and prices on a number of its services and products effective january  the increase may provide an opportunity for cryolife s competitors to gain market share 
if the company is unable to increase prices as planned and retain or improve its market share  its revenue and return to profitability may be adversely affected 
the company s cryopreserved tissues compete with other entities that cryopreserve human tissue on the basis of technology  customer service  and quality assurance 
as a result of the decrease in cryolife s procurement and processing yields of human tissue since the fda order in  the decrease in cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue shipments  and the lack of orthopaedic tissue shipments for a period of time  cryolife competitors have been favorably impacted and cryolife believes it has lost some market share 
cryolife believes that the human heart valves cryopreserved by cryolife  as compared to mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  compete on the factors set forth above  as well as by providing a tissue that is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions  such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction  valve replacements for women in their child bearing years  and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis 
the company s bioglue product competes on the basis of its high tensile strength and ease of use 
there can be no assurance that cryolife s products and services will be able to compete successfully 
any products developed by cryolife that gain regulatory clearance or approval then have to compete for market acceptance and market share 
failure of cryolife to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the fda order  related adverse publicity  and subsequent fda activity had and may continue to have an adverse effect on cryolife s competitive position 
cryolife s competitors may gain competitive advantages that may be difficult to overcome 
cryolife may not be successful in obtaining necessary clinical results and regulatory approvals for products and services in development  and such products and services may not achieve market acceptance 
cryolife s growth and profitability will depend  in part  upon its ability to complete development of and successfully introduce new products and services  including new applications of its bioglue and related technology and applications applying its synergraft technology 
developing new products and services to a commercially acceptable form is uncertain  and obtaining required regulatory approval is time consuming and costly 
for example  if the company is unable to resolve the issues it is addressing with the fda with regard to tissues processed using synergraft  it may incur significant costs over a lengthy period of time to meet the fda s requirements  and it may not be successful in meeting them or in offering a commercially successful product 
although cryolife has conducted pre clinical studies on certain products under development which indicate that such products may be effective in a particular application  there can be no assurance that the results obtained from expanded clinical studies will be consistent with earlier trial results or be sufficient for cryolife to obtain any required regulatory approvals or clearances 
there can be no assurance that cryolife will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products  that regulatory clearance or approval of these or any new products will be granted on a timely basis  if ever  or that the new products will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance 
the completion of the development of any of cryolife s products is subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies  including unanticipated technical or other problems  manufacturing difficulties  and the possible insufficiency of the funds allocated for the completion of such development 
consequently  cryolife s products under development may not be successfully developed or manufactured or  if developed and manufactured  such products may not meet price or performance objectives  be developed on a timely basis  or prove to be as effective as competing products 
the inability to successfully complete the development of a product  application or service  or a determination by cryolife  for financial  technical or other reasons  not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval of any product  application or service  particularly in instances in which cryolife has made significant capital expenditures  could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive and there can be no assurance that these efforts will lead to commercially successful products or services 
even the successful commercialization of a new service or product in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing  under utilized production capacity and continuing research and development and education costs 
the introduction of new products or services  which could include new products based on the company s protein hydrogel technology such as biofoam  biolastic and biodisc  may require significant physician training and years of clinical evidence derived from follow up studies on human implant recipients in order to gain acceptance in the medical community 
investments in new technologies or distribution rights may not be successful 
cryolife may invest in new technology licenses or distribution rights that may not succeed in the marketplace 
for example  in february cryolife entered into an arrangement with curasan ag for the distribution of its cerasorb ortho  a resorbable bone graft substitute 
that arrangement was terminated 
in such cases  cryolife may be unable to recover its initial investment  which investment could include acquisition of license or distribution rights or the purchase of initial inventory  all of which may adversely impact cryolife s profitability 
funding for the act technology may not be available 
the act is a reversible linker technology that has potential uses in the areas of fibrinolysis blood clot dissolving and other drug delivery applications 
in february cryolife formed aurazyme  a wholly owned subsidiary  in order to seek a corporate collaboration or to complete a potential private placement of equity or equity oriented securities to fund the commercial development of the act 
cryolife has been seeking such funding since to allow cryolife to continue development of this technology without incurring additional research and development expenditures  other than through aurazyme 
there can be no guarantee that such funding can be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if such financing is obtained  there is no guarantee that the act will in fact prove to be effective in the above applications 
in addition any new financing may cause dilution to the ownership interests of current cryolife shareholders  or may include restrictive covenants that could adversely affect cryolife or its business 
synergraft processed tissues may not demonstrate expected benefits 
cryolife processes bovine tissues with the synergraft technology and markets these services outside the us the process involves antigen reduction  which is the depopulation of the cells of the tissue to be implanted  leaving a matrix of protein fibers that has the potential to be repopulated with the recipient s cells 
if successful  cryolife believes that such repopulation may increase graft longevity and improve the biocompatibility and functionality of such tissue  resulting in the implanted tissue behaving more like the recipient s own tissue 
in animal studies  explanted synergraft processed heart valves have been shown to repopulate with the recipient s cells 
however  should such tissues implanted in humans not consistently and adequately repopulate with the human host cells  the higher priced synergraft processed tissues may not demonstrate benefits over other alternatives 
this could have a material adverse effect on future expansion plans and could limit future growth 
if cryolife is not successful in expanding its business activities in international markets  it will not be able to pursue one of its strategies for increasing its revenues 
cryolife s international operations are subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks it faces in the us  including o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  o difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  including foreign distributor relationships  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries  o adverse economic or political changes  o more limited protection for intellectual property in some countries  o changes in the company s international distribution network and direct sales force  o changes in currency exchange rates  o potential trade restrictions  exchange controls and import and export licensing requirements  and o potentially adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures 
cryolife is dependent on its key personnel 
cryolife s business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of its key technical personnel and senior management  many of who would be difficult to replace 
cryolife s business and future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management  processing  technical  marketing  sales  and support personnel for its operations 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that cryolife will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
cryolife s key employees include its management team  consisting of steven g 
anderson  president  chief executive officer  and chairman  d 
ashley lee  cpa  executive vice president  chief operating officer and chief financial officer  albert e 
heacox  phd  senior vice president  research and development  gerald b 
seery  senior vice president sales and marketing  and david m 
fronk  vice president  regulatory affairs and quality assurance 
other than a million life insurance policy on mr 
anderson  cryolife does not have key life insurance on these individuals 
the loss of key employees  the failure of any key employee to perform adequately  or cryolife s inability to attract and retain skilled employees as needed could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to cryolife and its industry extensive government regulation may adversely affect the ability to develop and sell products and services 
government regulation in the us  the eea  and other jurisdictions can determine the success of cryolife s efforts to market and develop its services and products and those of its competitors 
allograft tissues processed and distributed by cryolife are currently regulated as human tissue under rules promulgated by the fda pursuant to the public health services act 
these rules establish requirements for donor testing and screening of human tissue and record keeping relating to these activities and impose certain registration and product listing requirements on establishments that process or distribute human tissue or cellular based products 
the fda has finalized and implemented good tissue practice regulations akin to good manufacturing practices  followed by tissue banks and processors of human tissue 
these good tissue practice regulations will increase regulatory oversight of cryolife and other processors of human tissue 
although cryolife and its competitors are endeavoring to satisfy the new regulations when they go into effect  there can be no assurance of success 
bioglue is regulated as a class iii medical device and cryolife believes that its act may be regulated as a biologic or drug by the fda 
the act has not been approved for commercial distribution in the us or elsewhere 
fixed porcine heart valve products are classified as class iii medical devices 
cryolife may not obtain the fda approval required to distribute its porcine heart valve products in the us distribution of these products within the eea is dependent upon cryolife maintaining the ce mark for this product and its iso certifications  of which there can be no assurance 
most of cryolife s products and services in development and those of cryolife s competitors  if successfully developed  will require regulatory approvals from the fda and perhaps other regulatory authorities before they may be commercially distributed 
the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the fda normally involves clinical trials as well as an extensive premarket approval pma application and often takes many years 
the process is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity  and novelty of the product 
there can be no assurance that any products developed by cryolife or its competitors  independently or in collaboration with others  will receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing 
delays in obtaining us or foreign approvals could result in substantial additional cost and adversely affect a company s competitive position 
the fda may also place conditions on product approvals that could restrict commercial applications of such products 
product marketing approvals or clearances may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays imposed by the governmental clearance process may materially reduce the period during which a company such as cryolife has the exclusive right to commercialize patented products 
delays or rejections may also be encountered during any stage of the regulatory approval process based upon the failure of the clinical or other data to satisfactorily demonstrate compliance with  or upon the failure of the product to meet  the regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy and quality  and those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in applicable law  regulatory agency policy  or the adoption of new regulations 
clinical trials may also be delayed due to unanticipated side effects  inability to locate  recruit  and qualify sufficient numbers of patients  lack of funding  the inability to locate or recruit clinical investigators  the redesign of clinical trial programs  the inability to manufacture or acquire sufficient quantities of the particular product or any other components required for clinical trials  changes in development focus  and disclosure of trial results by competitors 
even if regulatory approval is obtained for any products or services offered by cryolife or one of its competitors  the scope of the approval may significantly limit the indicated usage for which such products or services may be marketed 
the unapproved use of the company s products or tissues preserved by cryolife could adversely affect the reputation of such products or services 
products or services marketed pursuant to fda or foreign oversight or approvals are subject to continuing regulation 
in the us  devices and biologics must be manufactured in registered establishments and  in the case of biologics  licensed establishments and must be produced in accordance with quality system regulations 
manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic fda inspection 
labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the export of devices and biologics is also subject to regulation and may require fda approval 
from time to time  the fda may modify such regulations  imposing additional or different requirements 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements  which may be ambiguous  could result in civil and criminal enforcement actions  warnings  citations  product recalls or detentions and other penalties and could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as noted above  the fda order and subsequent fda activity had  and may continue to have  such an effect 
in addition the national organ transplant act nota prohibits the acquisition or transfer of human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of human organs 
there can be no assurance that restrictive interpretations of nota will not be adopted in the future that will challenge one or more aspects of industry methods of charging for preservation services 
laboratory operations of cryolife and its competitors are subject to the us department of labor  occupational safety and health administration and environmental protection agency requirements for prevention of occupational exposure to infectious agents and hazardous chemicals and protection of the environment 
some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the processing  transportation and storage of human organs and tissue 
more restrictive laws or regulations may be adopted in the future and they could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
uncertainties related to patents and protection of proprietary technology may adversely affect the value of intellectual property 
cryolife owns several patents  patent applications  and licenses relating to its technologies  which it believes provide important competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that cryolife s pending patent applications will issue as patents or that challenges will not be instituted concerning the validity or enforceability of any patent owned by cryolife  or  if instituted  that such challenges will not be successful 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent could be substantial 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate cryolife s technologies or design around the patented aspects of such technologies 
there can be no assurance that cryolife s proposed technologies will not infringe patents or other rights owned by others 
in addition under certain of cryolife s license agreements  if cryolife fails to meet certain contractual obligations  including the payment of minimum royalty amounts  such licenses may become nonexclusive or terminable by the licensor  which could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
cryolife protects its proprietary technologies and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with its collaborative partners  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that cryolife will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that cryolife s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
future health care reimbursement methods and policies may affect the availability  amount and timing of revenues 
even though cryolife does not receive payments directly from third party health care payors  their reimbursement methods and policies impact demand for cryolife s cryopreserved tissue and other services and products 
cryolife s preservation services with respect to its cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues may be particularly susceptible to third party cost containment measures 
for example  the initial cost of a cryopreserved allograft heart valve generally exceeds the cost of a mechanical  synthetic  or animal derived valve 
cryolife is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods and policies utilized by third party health care payors or their effect on cryolife 
changes in the reimbursement methods and policies utilized by third party health care payors  including medicare  with respect to cryopreserved tissues provided for implant by cryolife and other company services and products  could have a material adverse effect on cryolife 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products and services and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available for cryolife to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on its investment in developing new products 
government  hospitals  and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products approved for marketing by the fda and by refusing in some cases to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and other third party payors for uses of cryolife s new products and services  market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
rapid technological change could cause services and products to become obsolete 
the technologies underlying products and services offered by cryolife and its competitors are subject to rapid and profound technological change 
competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop products or processes with significant advantages over the products and processes that cryolife or a competitor offers or is seeking to develop 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows of cryolife 
risks related to cryolife s capital stock securities prices for cryolife shares have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
the trading price of cryolife s common and preferred stock has been subject to wide fluctuations and may continue to be volatile in the future 
trading price fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors  including variations in operating results  regulatory actions such as the adverse fda activity  product liability claims  announcement of technological innovations or new products by cryolife or its competitors  governmental regulatory acts  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the medical device or service industries  actions taken by government regulators  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond cryolife s control 
if cryolife s revenues or operating results in future quarters fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of cryolife s common and preferred stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
changes in the trading price of cryolife s common and preferred stock may bear no relation to cryolife s actual operational or financial results 
if cryolife s share prices do not meet the requirements of the new york stock exchange  cryolife s shares may be delisted 
cryolife s closing common stock price in the period january  to february  has ranged from a high of to a low of 
cryolife s closing preferred stock price in the period march  date of first preferred stock issuance to february  has ranged from a high of to a low of 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation 
moreover  market prices for stocks of biotechnology related and technology companies frequently reach levels that bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
these market prices generally are not sustainable and are highly volatile 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against the company could result in substantial costs  divert the company s management s attention and resources and harm its financial condition and results of operations 
anti takeover provisions may discourage or make more difficult an attempt to obtain control of cryolife 
cryolife s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or make more difficult any attempt by a person or group to obtain control of cryolife  including provisions authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  restricting the persons who may call a special meeting of the shareholders  and prohibiting shareholders from taking action by written consent 
in addition cryolife is subject to certain provisions of florida law that may discourage or make more difficult takeover attempts or acquisitions of substantial amounts of cryolife s common stock 
further  pursuant to the terms of a shareholder rights plan adopted in and amended in  each outstanding share of common stock has one attached right 
the rights will cause substantial dilution of the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire cryolife on terms not approved by the board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
these provisions could potentially deprive the company s stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of the company s stock at above market prices 
common stock dividends are not likely to be paid in the foreseeable future 
cryolife has not paid  and does not presently intend to pay  cash dividends on its common stock 
cryolife may not be able to pay cash dividends on its capital stock due to legal and contractual restrictions and lack of liquidity 
under florida law and under the restrictions set forth in the company s credit agreement  the company may not be able to pay cash dividends on the company s capital stock 
under florida law  no distributions may be paid on capital stock  if after giving it effect a the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or b the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise the amount that would be needed  if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
under the company s new credit agreement  cash dividends on its common stock are prohibited  and cash dividends on its preferred stock may be paid only so long as the company maintains at least million  in the aggregate  of borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  cash and cash equivalents  each as more fully described above under risks factors risks related to the company s business the company s revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on its ability to borrow  which could make it more difficult to borrow needed funds 
increased borrowings under the credit agreement and judgments or settlements arising out of product liability or other claims  negative operating cash flow and other factors  which adversely affect available cash resources  will also adversely affect the company s ability to make cash dividend payments both generally and under the credit agreement 
in addition the terms of any future financing arrangements entered into by the company may also restrict its ability to pay dividends

item legal proceedings 
product liability claims in the normal course of business as a medical device and services company  the company has product liability complaints filed against it 
following the fda order  a greater number of lawsuits was filed 
as of february  the company was aware of six pending product liability lawsuits 
the lawsuits are currently in the pre discovery or discovery stages 
of these lawsuits  two allege product liability claims arising out of the company s orthopaedic tissue services  three allege product liability claims arising out of the company s allograft heart valve tissue services  and one alleges a product liability claim arising from bioglue 
as of february  there were two outstanding product liability lawsuits against the company that are covered by the insurance policy 
the company believes its insurance policy to be adequate to defend against the covered lawsuits in this time period 
additionally  there are four outstanding product liability lawsuits against the company that are not covered by insurance policies  as either the company has used all of its insurance coverage related to that policy year  or the claims were asserted against the company in periods after the coverage in the related incident year had lapsed 
additional uninsured claims may be filed in the future 
other product liability claims have been asserted against the company  which have not resulted in lawsuits 
the company is monitoring these claims 
the company performed an analysis as of december  of the settled but unpaid claims and the pending product liability claims based on settlement negotiations to date and advice from counsel 
as of december  the company had accrued a total of approximately million for settled but unpaid claims and pending product liability claims and recorded  representing amounts to be recovered from the company s insurance carriers 
the million accrual is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
this amount represents the company s estimate of the probable losses related to one settled but unpaid claim and three of the six pending product liability claims 
the company has not recorded an accrual for the remaining three product liability claims because management has concluded that either a loss is remote or that  although a loss is reasonably possible or probable  a reasonable estimate of that loss or the range of losses cannot be made at this time 
as of december  the company had accrued a total of approximately million for settled but unpaid claims and pending product liability claims and recorded million representing amounts to be recovered from the company s insurance carriers 
the million accrual is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the company s product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages  which may be assessed at trial 
the company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the maximum amount of the possible loss related to these claims  as most of the claims do not specify the damages sought and the company does not have a reasonable method for estimating the amount of compensatory or punitive damages that could be assessed by a trial jury 
additionally  if the company is unable to settle the outstanding claims for amounts within its ability to pay or one or more of the product liability claims in which the company is a defendant should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  there can be no assurance that such verdict s would not exceed the company s available insurance coverage and liquid assets 
failure by the company to meet required future cash payments to resolve the outstanding product liability claims would have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
on april  the company bound coverage for the insurance policy year 
this policy is a three year claims made insurance policy  ie claims incurred during the period april  through march  and reported during the period april  through march  are covered by this policy 
claims incurred prior to april  that have not been reported are uninsured 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to unreported product liability claims and records accruals as necessary for the estimated cost of unreported claims related to services performed and products used 
in january the company retained an independent actuarial firm to perform revised estimates of the unreported claims as of december  the independent firm estimated the unreported product loss liability using a frequency severity approach  whereby projected losses were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims were calculated based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim was calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the independent actuarial firm used a number of assumptions in order to estimate the unreported product loss liability including o a ceiling of million was selected for actuarial purposes in determining the liability per claim given the uncertainty in projecting claim losses in excess of million  o the future claim reporting lag time would be a blend of the company s experiences and industry data  o the frequency of unreported claims for accident years through would be lower than the company s experience in the policy year  but higher than the company s historical claim frequency prior to the policy year  o the average cost per claim would be lower than the company s experience since the policy year  but higher than the company s historical cost per claim prior to the policy year  o the average cost per bioglue claim would be consistent with the company s overall historical exposures until adequate historical data is available on this product line  and o the number of bioglue claims per million dollars of bioglue revenue would be lower than non bioglue claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on bioglue claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary 
the company believes that these assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the calculation of the unreported product liability loss  but actual developments could differ materially from the assumptions above

these individuals were not and are not executive officers of cryolife 
the formal order of investigation indicates that the sec s scope includes whether  during  among other things  cryolife or others may have traded while in possession of material nonpublic information  made or caused to be made false or misleading statements or omissions in press releases and sec filings  and failed to maintain accurate records and adequate controls
