overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states as of december  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which focuses on the expansion of ancillary businesses  such as in theatre advertising and complementary business lines that leverage the operating personnel  asset and customer bases of its theatrical exhibition partners  which includes us  amc and cinemark 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs and electronic video games located adjacent to the lobbies of certain of our theatres 
in addition  national cinemedia provides us with revenues from its sale of on screen advertising  rental of theatres for business meetings and concerts and other events 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors including the prospects of a film  the popularity of a film and the length of time since the film s release and generally decline as a percentage of admission revenues the longer a film is in exhibition 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs

results of operations the fiscal year was a challenging year for the industry and the company 
based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues were estimated to have declined five to six percent for the calendar year of in comparison to the calendar year of while we believe that the national box office revenues benefited from increased average ticket prices per patron and the solid performance of a few select films  which largely contributed to an increase in average concession revenues per patron  these factors could not offset the overall decline in the national attendance and box office revenues 
we believe the lack of commercially appealing films in general resulted in the decline in attendance and lackluster box office results 
our total revenue for the year ended december  fiscal period was  million  a increase over total revenue of  million for the year ended december  fiscal period 
our fiscal period box office results were favorably impacted by a increase in average ticket prices  largely offset by a decline in attendance 
the decline in the fiscal period attendance was partially mitigated by the inclusion of the results of operations of the signature theatres locations acquired on september   the seven theatres acquired from r c theatres on april  and the theatres acquired from eastern federal corporation on july  since the r c and eastern federal acquisitions occurred subsequent to the fiscal period  the results of operations of such theatres were not included in the fiscal period results 
in addition  the fiscal period results include the results of operations of the acquired signature theatres for a full twelve months  whereas the results of operations of signature theatres were excluded from the first nine months of the fiscal period because the acquisition did not occur until september  excluding the impact of the incremental attendance from these theatres  the company s fiscal period total attendance declined by approximately 
the increase in average ticket prices was not enough to offset the company s fiscal period attendance per average screen decline of  resulting in a decline in the average screen box office revenues of 
based on certain industry sources  on a same screen basis  the percentage by which the company s fiscal period calendar box office revenue declined from the prior year comparative period approximated the percentage by which industry box office revenue declined for the same time period 
during the fiscal period  we experienced growth in average concession revenues per patron and other operating revenues 
the growth in average concession revenues per patron was attributable to changes in our product mix including certain pricing and size changes and the increased breadth of family oriented and concession friendly film product exhibited during the fiscal period 
increases in advertising revenues and revenues from our vendor marketing programs contributed to the increase in other operating revenues for the fiscal period 
income from operations decreased to million for the fiscal period compared to million in the fiscal period 
net income increased to million in the fiscal period compared to net income of million in the fiscal period 
earnings per diluted share increased to for the fiscal period compared to during the fiscal period 
ebitda was million for the fiscal period  an increase of from million in the fiscal period and represented an ebitda margin of 
the decline in income from operations is primarily attributable to the decline in attendance during the fiscal period coupled with increases in certain operating expenses incurred during the fiscal period  partially offset by incremental admission  concession and other operating revenues as described more fully below 
the increase in net income  earnings per diluted share and ebitda and ebitda margin during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to a loss on extinguishment of debt of million recorded in the fiscal period  partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the refinancing transactions consummated in connection with the extraordinary dividend transaction described further in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
a tabular reconciliation of net income to ebitda and net cash provided by operating activities is provided below under results of operations ebitda 
during the fiscal period  we made significant progress with our strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period totaled approximately million 
in spite of the downturn in the fiscal period attendance  we continued to generate significant cash flows from operations and ended the year with approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
our cash position supports our commitment to returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends 
in connection with our share repurchase program  which provides for the authorization to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock  during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its outstanding class a common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company made no other repurchases of its outstanding class a common stock during fiscal on march   regal and amc announced the combination of the operations of rcm and amc s subsidiary  ncn  into a new joint venture company known as national cinemedia 
on july   cinemark  inc  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired a interest in national cinemedia 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of this joint venture arrangement 
our investment in national cinemedia contributed incremental revenue and ebitda for the fiscal period 
on april   the company acquired from r c theatres seven theatres and screens in maryland  florida  pennsylvania and virginia for a cash purchase price of million  subject to post closing adjustments 
on july   the company acquired from eastern federal corporation theatres and screens in florida  north carolina and south carolina for a purchase price of million  subject to post closing adjustments 
during the fiscal period  these acquisitions contributed approximately million attendees or to our total attendance 
these acquisitions are consistent with our commitment to consummate accretive acquisitions that enhance our asset base and improve our consolidated operating results 
in addition to the fiscal acquisitions  we opened new theatres with screens  added screens through expansion of our existing facilities and closed theaters with screens  ending the fiscal period with theaters and  screens 
we are optimistic regarding the film slate and share the view of a number of film studio executives and analysts who believe the industry is poised to benefit from a year of solid box office performance 
evidenced by the film studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as ice age  x men  over the hedge  the poseidon adventure  mission impossible  the da vinci code  cars  pirates of the caribbean  superman returns and charlotte s web 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  due in part to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect theatre capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we are expecting a modest rebound in attendance as a result of the upcoming high profile film releases described above and increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron 
in addition  we expect fiscal admission and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and incremental growth from our fiscal acquisitions and our investment in national cinemedia 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  efficient operations  selective upgrades and providing incremental returns to our stockholders

fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions total admissions revenues decreased million  or  to  million for the fiscal period  from  million for the fiscal period 
the fiscal period results were favorably impacted by the timing of the fiscal period calendar  which consisted of fifty three weeks compared to the fifty two weeks during the fiscal period 
the additional week of operations was significant in that it accounted for approximately of the fiscal period total attendance 
offsetting the impact of the timing of the fiscal period  the fiscal period results benefited from the results of operations of the acquired hoyts cinemas theatres for all periods  whereas the results of operations of the acquired hoyts cinemas theatres were excluded from the first three months of the fiscal period because the hoyts cinemas acquisition did not occur until march  in addition  the fiscal period includes results of operations of operating theatres acquired during the second and third quarters of see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for additional information regarding these acquisitions

the decrease in ebitda for the fiscal period was attributable to a loss on extinguishment of debt of million recorded as a result of the second fiscal quarter refinancing transactions 
we believe ebitda provides a useful measure of liquidity and financial performance for our investors because ebitda is an industry comparative measure of liquidity and financial performance prior to the payment of interest and taxes and because it is a primary financial measure used by management to assess our performance and liquidity 
ebitda is not a measurement of liquidity or financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for net income or other operations data or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity 
in addition  not all funds depicted by ebitda are available for management s discretionary use 
for example  a substantial portion of such funds are subject to contractual restrictions and functional requirements for debt service  fund necessary capital expenditures and to meet other commitments from time to time as described in more detail in this form k 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period in millions net income interest expense  net provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda interest expense  net provision for income taxes deferred income taxes changes in operating assets and liabilities loss on debt extinguishment other items  net net cash provided by operating activities cash flows the following table summarizes certain cash flow data for the fiscal period  fiscal and fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents fiscal period compared to fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period  which remained relatively consistent compared to million in the fiscal period 
fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were impacted by several factors including a decrease in income from operations during the fiscal period related to increases in certain operating expense items  partially offset by incremental admission  concession and other operating revenues and the inclusion of the results of operations of theatres purchased from signature theatres  r c theatres and eastern federal corporation 
an approximate million reduction in adjustments primarily loss on extinguishment of debt  partially offset by incremental depreciation and amortization expense and a loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by a million increase in net income and a million increase in the changes in operating assets and liabilities further contributed to the million net decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net increase in the changes in operating assets and liabilities  and other working capital items was primarily related to the timing of certain vendor payments and income tax payments  increases in deferred revenues and trade and other receivables  partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
contributing to the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was a decline in cash used for acquisitions  partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures during the fiscal period  which was primarily attributable to the timing of certain capital projects during the fiscal period 
in addition  we had greater proceeds from the disposition of assets during the fiscal period as compared the fiscal period 
cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to increases in the fiscal period quarterly dividend payments compared to the per share fiscal period dividend payments and the fiscal period million aggregate purchase of treasury shares 
fiscal period compared to fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to approximately million for the fiscal period 
the million net decrease was attributable to a million decrease in net income offset by a net increase of million in adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities 
such adjustments primarily included a million loss on the extinguishment of debt and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  which was primarily attributable to increases in depreciation expense related to regal cinemedia  the inclusion of the fiscal period acquisitions and the inclusion of hoyts during the entire fiscal period as compared to only nine months during the fiscal period 
in addition  a net decrease of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of certain vendor payments and income tax payments and an increase in deferred revenues 
the changes in certain other working capital items were primarily related to the change in the company s calendar for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal period compared to million for the fiscal period 
this decrease was primarily due to fewer capital expenditures associated with regal cinemedia and the timing of certain capital projects during the fiscal period 
during the fiscal period  the company consummated three acquisitions for a net aggregate purchase price of million 
also during the fiscal period  regal cinemas entered into a sale and leaseback transaction involving one of its owned theatres for total sale proceeds of approximately million 
cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the june  extraordinary dividend payment  redemption of a portion of the senior subordinated notes  repayment of the third amended and restated regal cinemas senior credit facility and increases in our fiscal period dividend payments  offset by borrowings under the new  million regal cinemas senior credit facility entered into on may  the senior credit facility 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further description of such financing transactions 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service  share repurchases and the company s quarterly dividend payments 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and the revolving facility provided for under the senior credit facility 
under the terms of the senior credit facility  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than its subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal s ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses or redeem its convertible senior notes 
our revenues are generally collected in cash through admissions and concessions revenues 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within twelve months and  as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet is likely to reflect a working capital deficit 
we fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  adding new screens to existing theatres  upgrading the company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company s internal rate of return targets 
we currently expect capital expenditures for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal  exclusive of acquisitions 
such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions conducted during the normal course of our business

interest rate swaps on july   regal cinemas entered into four hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with final maturity terms ranging from three to five years each 
on september   regal cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with a maturity term of four years 
these interest rate swaps were assigned to hedge approximately  million of variable rate liabilities under the senior credit facility 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and will receive interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps prospectively qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on approximately  million of the aforementioned credit facility 
the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the five interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes  and represents an estimate of the amounts regal cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors  including current interest rates 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined to be approximately million  which has been recorded as a component of other non current assets with a corresponding amount of million  net of tax  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the interest rate swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness for the years ended december  and december  sale leaseback transactions for information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included part ii  item of this form k 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
these accounting principles require that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities  including the related deferred tax assets and liabilities related to such amounts 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets in sfas specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
such adjustments have been historically insignificant 
actual film costs and film costs payable could differ materially from those estimates 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and january   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life to us of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than forty years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties were appraised as part of the bankruptcy process described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and january   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on their probable tax treatment 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
with the exception of valuation allowances recorded relative to pre acquisition periods  decreases in the valuation allowance generally result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes 
should we ultimately realize a benefit from tax assets in excess of the amount recorded that relates to pre acquisition periods  goodwill would be reduced to the extent of such excess or recorded goodwill  as appropriate 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us and may be challenged by the tax authorities 
accordingly  although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we establish accruals relative to tax uncertainties that we deem to be probable of loss and that can be reasonably estimated 
such accruals are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
with the exception of certain changes in pre acquisition tax uncertainties  any change in the balance of an accrual established relative to a tax uncertainty impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that the adjustment is made to the accrual 
for the fiscal year ended december   our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
seasonality the company s revenues are usually seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday seasons 
the unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other quarter 
the seasonality of motion picture exhibition  however  has become less pronounced as studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year
