item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will receive the funds we anticipate or that we may not have to repay the million debt sooner than would otherwise be the case  either of which will have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our continuing operations during and beyond 
we have a small sales force and may be unable to penetrate targeted market segments 
we have a small sales force and may be unable to penetrate targeted market segments 
our sales force consists of a vice president of customer relations who is focused on specifically targeted market segments 
our small sales force may not have sufficient resources to adequately penetrate one or more of the targeted market segments 
further  if the sales force is successful in penetrating one or more of the targeted market segments  we are unable to assure that our products will be accepted in those segments or that product acceptance will result in product revenues which  together with revenues from corporate licensing and supply agreements  will be sufficient for us to operate profitably 
we have limited manufacturing experience  and may be unable to produce our products at the unit costs necessary for the products to be competitive in the market  which could cause our financial condition to suffer 
we have limited experience manufacturing our products in commercially viable quantities 
we have increased our production capacity for the biojector system and the vitajet product line through automation of  and changes in  production methods  in order to achieve savings through higher volumes of production 
if we are unable to achieve these savings  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
the current cost per injection of the biojector system and vitajet product line is substantially higher than that of traditional needle syringes  our principal competition 
in order to reduce costs  a key element of our business strategy has been to reduce the overall manufacturing cost through automating production and packaging 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve sales and manufacturing volumes necessary to realize cost savings from volume production at levels necessary to result in significant unit manufacturing cost reductions 
failure to do so will continue to make competing with needle syringes on the basis of cost very difficult and will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to successfully manufacture devices at a unit cost that will allow the product to be sold profitably 
failure to do so would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and must continue to comply with these regulations or our business could suffer 
our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive government regulation in both the us and abroad 
if we cannot comply with these regulations  we may be unable to distribute our products  which could cause our business to suffer or fail 
in the us  the development  manufacture  marketing and promotion of medical devices are regulated by the food and drug administration fda under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca 
in  we received clearance from the fda under section k of the ffdca to market a hand held co powered needle free injection system 
the ffdca provides that new pre market notifications under section k of the ffdca are required to be filed when  among other things  there is a major change or modification in the intended use of a device or a change or modification to a legally marketed device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness 
a device manufacturer is expected to make the initial determination as to whether the change to its device or its intended use is of a kind that would necessitate the filing of a new k notification 
although the biojector system incorporates changes from the system with respect to which our k marketing clearance was received and expands its intended use  we made the determination that these were not major changes or modifications in intended use or changes in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device 
accordingly  we further concluded that the k clearance permitted us to market the biojector system in the us in june  we received clearance from the fda under k to market a version of our biojector system in a configuration targeted at high volume injection applications 
in october  we received k clearance for a needle free disposable vial adapter device 
in march  we received additional k clearance for certain enhancements to our biojector system 
in june  we received k clearance for the cool 
click  a modified vitajet 
in march  we received k clearance for the serojet  also a modified vitajet 
in april  we received k clearance to market a reconstitution kit and vial adapter 
in july  we received k clearance to market the q cap needle free reconstitution mm vial adapter 
the fda may not concur with our determination that our current and future products can be qualified by means of a k submission 
future changes to manufacturing procedures could require that we file a new k notification 
also  future products  product enhancements or changes  or changes in product use may require clearance under section k  or they may require fda pre market approval pma or other regulatory clearances 
pmas and regulatory clearances other than k clearance generally involve more extensive prefiling testing than a k clearance and a longer fda review process 
it is current fda policy that such pre filled syringes are evaluated by the fda by submitting a request for designation rfd to the office of combination products ocp 
the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company with which we partner is responsible for the submission to the ocp 
a pre filled syringe meets the fda s definition of a combination product  or a product comprised of two or more regulated components  ie drug device 
the ocp will assign a center with primary jurisdiction for a combination product cder  cdrh to ensure the timely and effective pre market review of the product 
depending on the circumstances  drug and combination drug device regulation can be much more extensive and time consuming than device regulation 
fda regulatory processes are time consuming and expensive 
product applications submitted by us may not be cleared or approved by the fda 
in addition  our products must be manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practices  as specified in regulations under the ffdca 
the fda has broad discretion in enforcing the ffdca  and noncompliance with the ffdca could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from product detentions  device alerts or field corrections  to mandatory recalls  seizures  injunctive actions and civil or criminal penalties 
sales of our iject pre filled syringe product are dependent on regulatory approval being obtained for the product s use with a given drug to treat a specific condition 
it is the responsibility of the strategic partner producing the drug to obtain this approval 
the failure of a partner to obtain regulatory approval or to comply with government regulations after approval has been received could harm our business 
in order for a strategic partner to sell our iject pre filled device for delivery of its drug to treat a specific condition  the partner must first obtain government approval 
this process is subject to extensive government regulation both in the us and abroad 
as a result  sales of the iject product to any strategic partner are dependent on that partner s ability to obtain regulatory approval 
accordingly  failure of a partner to obtain that approval could cause our financial results to suffer 
in addition  if a partner fails to comply with governmental regulations after initial regulatory approval has been obtained  sales of iject product to that partner may cease  which could cause our financial results to suffer 
the iject is still in development and has not yet been sold commercially 
if we cannot meet international product standards  we will be unable to distribute our products outside of the united states  which could cause our business to suffer 
distribution of our products in countries other than the us may be subject to regulation in those countries 
failure to satisfy these regulations would impact our ability to sell our products in these countries and could cause our business to suffer 
bioject has received the following certifications from underwriters laboratories or t 
gbaijpg 
v product services that products and quality system meet the applicable requirements which allows us to label our products with the ce mark and sell them in the european community and non european countries 
certificate dated iso and cmdcas underwriters laboratories february annex v of the directive eec on medical devices tuv october re certification audit february annex ii  section of the directive eec on medical devices tuv october re certification audit february we may be unable to continue to meet the standards of iso or ce mark certification  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause our financial results to suffer 
if the healthcare industry limits coverage or reimbursement levels  the acceptance of our products could suffer 
the price of our products exceeds the price of needle syringes and  if coverage or reimbursement levels are reduced  market acceptance of our products could be harmed 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of healthcare facilities 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increased government regulation of reimbursement rates and capital expenditures 
among other things  third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain or reduce healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and levels of reimbursement for healthcare products and procedures 
because the price of the biojector system and vitajet product line exceeds the price of a needle syringe  cost control policies of third party payers  including government agencies  may adversely affect acceptance and use of the biojector system and vitajet product line 
we depend on outside suppliers for manufacturing 
our current manufacturing processes for the biojector jet injector and disposable syringes as well as manufacturing processes to produce the vitajet consist primarily of assembling component parts supplied by outside suppliers 
some of these components are currently obtained from single sources  with some components requiring significant production lead times 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the delivery of certain components 
to date  such delays have not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may experience delays in the future  and these delays could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our results of operations could suffer 
if our products achieve market acceptance or if we are successful in entering into product supply agreements with major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  we expect to experience rapid growth 
such growth would require expanded customer service and support  increased personnel  expanded operational and financial systems  and implementing new and expanded control procedures 
we may be unable to attract sufficient qualified personnel or successfully manage expanded operations 
as we expand  we may periodically experience constraints that would adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to compete in the medical equipment field  which could cause our business to fail 
the medical equipment market is highly competitive and competition is likely to intensify 
if we cannot compete  our business will fail 
our products compete primarily with traditional needle syringes  safety syringes and also with other alternative drug delivery systems 
in addition  manufacturers of needle syringes  as well as other companies  may develop new products that compete directly or indirectly with our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this market 
a variety of new technologies for example  transdermal patches are being developed as alternatives to injection for drug delivery 
while we do not believe such technologies have significantly affected the use of injection for drug delivery to date  there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories as well as substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and customer support resources 
we are dependent on a single technology  and if it cannot compete or find market acceptance  our business will suffer 
our strategy has been to focus our development and marketing efforts on our needle free injection technology 
focus on this single technology leaves us vulnerable to competing products and alternative drug delivery systems 
if our technology cannot find market acceptance or cannot compete against other technologies  business will suffer 
we perceive that healthcare providers desire to minimize the use of the traditional needle syringe has stimulated development of a variety of alternative drug delivery systems such as safety syringes  jet injection systems  nasal delivery systems and transdermal diffusion patches 
in addition  pharmaceutical companies frequently attempt to develop drugs for oral delivery instead of injection 
while we believe that for the foreseeable future there will continue to be a significant need for injections  alternative drug delivery methods may be developed which are preferable to injection 
we rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and procedures and patents to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been granted a number of patents in the us and several patents in other countries covering certain technology embodied in our current jet injection system and certain manufacturing processes 
additional patent applications are pending in the us and certain foreign countries 
the claims contained in any patent application may not be allowed  or any patent or our patents collectively may not provide adequate protection for our products and technology 
in the absence of patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to this technology to the same extent as the laws of the us we believe we have independently developed our technology and attempt to ensure that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of others 
we know of no such infringement claims 
however  any claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if our products fail or cause harm  we could be subject to substantial product liability  which could cause our business to suffer 
producers of medical devices may face substantial liability for damages in the event of product failure or if it is alleged the product caused harm 
we currently maintain product liability insurance and  to date  have experienced only one product liability claim 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be subject to a number of such claims  that our product liability insurance would cover such claims  or that adequate insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms in the future 
our business could be adversely affected by product liability claims or by the cost of insuring against such claims 
we must retain qualified personnel in a competitive marketplace  or we may not be able to grow our business 
our success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management 
we may be unable to retain our key employees  namely our management team  or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees 
john gandolfo  our chief financial officer and vice president of finance  will be departing bioject in may as part of the restructuring we announced in march although we have implemented workforce reductions  there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees 
our key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time 
if we fail to attract and retain key employees  our business could be harmed 
there are a large number of shares eligible for sale into the public market in the near future  which may reduce the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market  or the perception that such sales could occur 
we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
 shares of our common stock currently outstanding are eligible for sale without registration pursuant to rule under the securities act  subject to certain conditions of rule the holder of these shares also has certain demand and piggyback registration rights enabling it to register its shares under the securities act for sale 
we have registered approximately million shares for resale on form s registration statements  including approximately million shares issuable upon exercise of warrants 
in addition  we have  shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plan 
as of december   options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock were outstanding and will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time subject to vesting 
in march  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
at that time  we also agreed to sell approximately million shares of series e preferred stock  subject to shareholder approval 
each share of series e preferred stock will be convertible into one share of our common stock  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
also in march  we entered into a million convertible note financing 
subject to shareholder approval  the principal amount of this note  plus accrued interest  will be convertible into common stock at per share 
if we prepay this debt  we have agreed to issue the lender a warrant to purchase an equivalent number of shares to what it would receive on conversion 
we have agreed to register for resale the shares of common stock underlying the warrants  the series e preferred stock and the convertible note 
our stock price may be highly volatile  which increases the risk of securities litigation 
the market for our common stock and for the securities of other early stage  small market capitalization companies has been highly volatile in recent years 
this increases the risk of securities litigation relating to such volatility 
we believe that factors such as quarter to quarter fluctuations in financial results  new product introductions by us or our competition  public announcements  changing regulatory environments  sales of common stock by certain existing shareholders  substantial product orders and announcement of licensing or product supply agreements with major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies could contribute to the volatility of the price of our common stock  causing it to fluctuate dramatically 
general economic trends such as recessionary cycles and changing interest rates may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring activities  and our restructuring activities may not result in the expected benefits  which would negatively impact our future results of operations 
in march  we restructured our operations  which included reducing the size of our workforce 
despite our restructuring efforts  we cannot assure you that we will achieve all of the operating expense reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows currently anticipated from these restructuring activities in the periods contemplated  or at all 
our inability to realize these benefits  and our failure to appropriately structure our business to meet market conditions  could negatively impact our results of operations 
as part of our recent restructuring activities  we have reduced the workforce in certain portions of our business 
this reduction in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future opportunities due to resource limitations  which could negatively affect our long term revenues 
in addition  these workforce reductions could result in a lack of focus and reduced productivity by remaining employees due to changes in responsibilities or concern about future prospects  which in turn may negatively affect our future revenues 
further  we believe our future success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
our restructuring activities could negatively affect our ability to attract such personnel as a result of perceived risk of future workforce reductions 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be successful 
concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control or otherwise influence or control most matters submitted to our shareholders 
certain funds affiliated with life sciences opportunities fund ii institutional  lp and its affiliates collectively  the lof funds currently own shares of series d preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock representing in aggregate approximately of our outstanding voting power assuming exercise of the warrants 
at our annual meeting  shareholders will be asked to approve a proposed preferred stock financing with the lof funds and their affiliates 
if this transaction is approved  the lof funds and their affiliates could own shares of preferred stock and warrants representing as much as approximately one third of our outstanding voting power assuming exercise of all of the warrants held by the lof funds and their affiliates 
as a result  the lof funds and their affiliates potentially could control matters submitted to a vote of shareholders  including a change of control transaction  which could prevent or delay such a transaction

overview we develop needle free injection systems that improve the way patients receive medications and vaccines 
our long term goal is to become the leading supplier of needle free injection systems to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in  we will continue to focus our business development efforts on new and existing licensing and supply agreements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
by bundling customized needle free delivery systems with partners injectable medications and vaccines  we can enhance demand for these products in the healthcare provider and end user markets 
in  our clinical research efforts will continue to be aimed primarily at collaborations in the areas of vaccines and drug delivery 
currently  we are involved in collaborations with approximately institutions 
in  our research and development efforts will focus on the iject single use disposable product 
in addition  we will continue to work on product improvements to existing devices and development of products for our strategic partners 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
various factors may affect quarterly and yearly operating results including i the length of time to close product sales  ii customer budget cycles  iii the implementation of cost reduction measures  iv uncertainties and changes in product sales due to third party payer policies and proposals relating to healthcare cost containment  v the timing and amount of payments under licensing and technology development agreements  and vi the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
we do not expect to report net income in cash requirements for the next twelve months anticipated requirements for cash for the next twelve months from december  are estimated to total approximately million as follows estimated cash required for operations short term note payable proceeds from sale of headquarters building portion of long term debt to be repaid with proceeds from sale of headquarters building remaining current portion of long term debt current portion of capital leases estimated cash capital expenditures cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  in addition to our current cash resources  we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party to sell our new jersey headquarters building for million  net of anticipated selling costs 
this sale is expected to close on or before april  as indicated above  the proceeds from this sale must be used to pay down the long term portion of our term loan 
on march   we entered into an agreement with respect to million of convertible debt financing the agreement with life sciences opportunities fund ii institutional  lp lof and several of its affiliates 
under the terms of the agreement  we received million of debt financing on march  interest on debt outstanding under the agreement is per annum 
the maturity date of the debt issued pursuant to the agreement is the earliest of i april   ii the time of closing of our offering and sale of at least million of our series e preferred stock  and iii the occurrence of an event of default  as defined in the agreement 
in connection with the agreement  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at per share to the lenders 
the warrants expire in september also on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement the securities purchase agreement with lof and its affiliates collectively the lof affiliates 
under the securities purchase agreement  upon receiving shareholder approval at our annual meeting  which is expected to be held in may  and subject to customary closing and other conditions  the lof affiliates will purchase approximately million of our series e preferred stock at per share including the conversion of the million of convertible debt financing and related accrued interest 
in addition  on march   we entered into a term loan agreement with partners for growth  lp pfg for a million convertible debt financing the debt financing 
we have two other loans outstanding with pfg with a combined total of approximately million outstanding as of december  under the terms of the debt financing  we received million 
this loan will be due in march the loan bears interest at the prime rate and will be convertible  subject to shareholder approval  at any time  by pfg into our common stock at per share 
in addition  if our common stock trades at a price of per share or higher for consecutive trading days  we can force pfg to convert the debt to common stock  subject to certain limitations on trading volume 
shareholders will also be asked to approve the conversion feature of this transaction at our annual meeting  which is expected to be held in may if shareholders do not approve the conversion feature of this transaction at the earlier of the annual meeting or july   the loan will be payable upon demand by pfg 
if we prepay this loan  we will issue pfg a warrant to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to what it would have received upon conversion 
on march   our board of directors approved a plan of restructuring  which includes reorganizing our corporate organization  closing our new jersey administrative office and reducing operations headcount and research and development costs at our portland  oregon facility 
in addition  jim o shea  our president and chief executive officer  will be based out of our portland  oregon location 
also  john gandolfo  our chief financial officer  will depart bioject on may  during the first quarter of  we anticipate recognizing a charge of approximately  associated with severance costs for terminated employees as part of the restructuring 
such costs will be paid out over a month period 
in addition  there will be a non cash charge in connection with the acceleration of non vested stock awards  which we are currently evaluating 
the restructuring activities are expected to be completed by the second quarter of going forward  we anticipate annual cost savings in excess of million in and million in in connection with the expense reductions 
with our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities of million at december   and with the addition of the committed funds of million of convertible debt financing with lof and several of its affiliates and the committed funds of million of convertible debt financing from pfg  we believe that we will have the financial resources to fund our operations and anticipated cash expenditures through at least may  by that time  subject to shareholder approval and customary and other closing conditions  we anticipate that we will receive an additional million of equity financing in the form of series e convertible preferred stock from the lof affiliates  which we believe will allow us to fund our operations and anticipated cash capital expenditures through at least march  if we do not receive the required shareholder approval in connection with the proposed equity and debt financings  we might not be able to fund our continuing operations 
in addition  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in closing the series e convertible preferred stock financing  even if shareholder approval is obtained 
in either such case  we will be forced to explore alternative plans  which could include a further curtailment of operations and alternative financing from other sources 
results of operations the consolidated financial data for the years ended december   and are presented in the following table year ended december  revenue net sales of products licensing and technology fees operating expenses manufacturing research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense net loss allocable to common shareholders basic and diluted net loss per common share shares used in per share calculations revenue the million  or  increase in product sales in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the following million of sales to merial in compared to million in  a million increase in in sales of our spring powered products to serono compared to  a million increase in in sales of our vial adapter product to ferring compared to  million of sales of our b products to chronimed in compared to none in  and a  increase in in sales of our b products to customers other than chronimed compared to product sales in included  of sales of our b device which had been written off in prior years 
the increase in product sales in compared to was partially offset by a million decrease in sales of our vial adapter product to amgen 
sales of vial adapters to amgen were lower in compared to due to inventory build up by amgen prior to our move to a larger facility in april the million  or  increase in product sales in compared to was primarily due to an increase of  in sales of our vial adapter product to amgen   of sales of our vial adapter product to ferring in compared to none in  and and an increase of million in sales of our spring powered products to serono 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in sales of our vial adapter product to berlex 
the increases in product sales in both compared to and compared to were due primarily to increases in units sold 
we did not have any significant sales price increases for our products in either comparable period 
we expect a combined decrease in product sales to merial and serono of approximately million in compared to their purchases 
both merial and serono built up inventory in  which will affect their purchases 
license and technology fees decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease was primarily due to the conclusion of agreements with several customers by the end of in  we recognized million pursuant to the terms of our production and companion animal license and supply agreement with merial  compared to million in partially offsetting these decreases were  of royalty revenues in  primarily related to sales of our vetjet product to merial  compared to  in the million  or  increase in license and technology fees in compared to was primarily due to the recognition of an additional  in compared to  pursuant to the terms of the production and companion animal license and supply agreements we have with merial  and the recognition of a  non refundable development fee and a  wind down fee from a potential licensing partner 
we currently have active licensing and or development agreements  which often include commercial product supply provisions  with serono  merial  an undisclosed japanese pharmaceutical firm and an undisclosed european biotechnology company 
we currently have active product supply agreements with amgen  ferring and chronimed 
manufacturing expense manufacturing expense is made up of the cost of products sold and manufacturing overhead expense related to excess manufacturing capacity 
the million  or  increase in manufacturing expense in compared to was due primarily to the increased product sales mentioned above  and an increase of  for increasing our provision for future warranty costs 
partially offsetting these increases was  of severance charges in compared to none in the million  or  increase in manufacturing expense in compared to was due primarily to the increases in product sales discussed above 
manufacturing expense in also includes  of severance charges related to the terminations compared to none in research and development research and development costs include labor  materials and costs associated with clinical studies incurred in the research and development of new products and modifications to existing products 
the million  or  decrease in research and development expense in compared to was primarily due to an  decrease in iject project expenses  no severance charges in compared to  in and a  decrease related to our companion animal project  which was completed and moved to the commercial phase early in the first quarter of we also had a  decrease in clinical and regulatory labor costs due to fewer employees and a  decrease related to the winding down of certain other projects in compared to  partially offset by new projects started in we continue to work on moving our ml iject from the clinical phase to the production phase including establishing the automated sterile fill capabilities 
in addition  we are working on merial s production animal device and our clinical supply of iject for our japanese pharmaceutical partner 
the million  or  increase in research and development expense in compared to was primarily due to million of costs incurred in in relation to moving our ml iject including expenses related to the automated sterile fill capabilities from the clinical phase to the production phase compared to million of such charges in in addition   was incurred in for moving the merial companion animal project to production  offset in part by approximately  related to product updates completed in that were not incurred in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative costs include labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
the million  or  decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to was due to a  decrease in salaries and related expenses  a  decrease in severance related costs and a  decrease in legal  consulting fees and other expenses 
the reductions in salaries and related expenses and travel costs were due to reduced headcount in compared to the decrease in compared to was partially offset by a  loss recorded in the second quarter of related to the write down of assets held for sale to their estimated fair market value

new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues  inventory valuation  and long lived asset impairment 
revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  product development revenue is recognized  to the extent of cash received  on a percentage of completion basis as qualifying expenditures are incurred 
licensing revenues  if separable  are recognized over the term of the license agreement 
the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf finalized eitf accounting for multiple element arrangements in november eitf requires arrangements with multiple elements to be broken out as separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only if the amount due can be reliably measured and the earnings process is substantially complete 
any units that can not be separated must be accounted for as a combined unit 
our accounting policy is consistent with eitf should agreements be terminated prior to completion  or our estimates of percentage of completion be incorrect  we could have unanticipated fluctuations in our revenue on a quarterly basis 
amounts received prior to meeting recognition criteria are recorded on our balance sheet as deferred revenues and are recognized according to the terms of the associated agreements

all inventories are reviewed quarterly to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices and if certain components have become obsolete 
we record valuation adjustments for inventory based on the above factors 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate our long lived assets and certain identified intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and on our fixed and variable interest rate debt 
we mitigate the risk in our investment portfolio by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy

these debt obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in rates 
at december   we had million outstanding under our term loan at an interest rate of and  outstanding under the line of credit agreement at an interest rate of
