cautionary statement under the private securities litigation reform act of executive overview the company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products 
the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented  both geographically and along product lines  there are few publicly traded companies in the industry  certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs  and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited 
analysts generally estimate the global market to be billion of which iff represents  the company s nearest sized competitor is of similar size 
the five largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately of the global market 
fragrance compounds are used in perfumes  cosmetics  toiletries  hair care products  deodorants  soaps  detergents and softeners as well as air care products 
major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry  including perfume and toiletries manufacturers  and the household products industry  including manufacturers of soaps  detergents  household cleaners and air fresheners 
flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods  beverages  dairy  food and confectionery products 
the company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in making fragrances 
approximately of the company s ingredient production is consumed internally  the balance is sold to third party customers 
changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income and dual earner households  leisure time  health concerns  urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances 
these developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality  as well as the market for colognes and toiletries 
such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods  soft drinks and low fat food products that must conform to expected tastes 
these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products 
flavors and fragrances are generally

a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer  and

a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product 
flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational characteristics  including research and development  the nature of the creative and production processes  the manner in which products are distributed and the type of customer  many of the company s customers purchase both flavors and fragrances 
a breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below 
sales by category 
html piechartjpg 
the company s five largest customers comprise of consolidated sales and its top thirty customers  these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years 
no customer accounts for or more of sales 
a key factor for success is inclusion on major customers core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business 
the company is currently on the majority of core supplier lists of its major customers  participation in such lists is key to the company s strategy for growth 
the flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions 
in addition  pricing pressure placed on the company s customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to the company and its competitors 
leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates  to an extent  the impact of pricing pressure 
success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a cost efficient and effective manner  and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery 
the company produces more than  unique compounds  of which approximately are flavors and fragrances 
the company continually creates new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of its customers end products 
no single compound represents more than of net sales 
development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists  and application and research chemists 
an important contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the development of new ingredients 
the company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy 
the company is not materially dependent on any patents  trademarks or licenses 
the company s recent strategic focus has been

the company has exited certain non core businesses  the last of which was sold in the quality and depth of the company s research and development efforts have improved significantly 
in the period  the company patented numerous new  commercially viable ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances  fifteen were patented in  nine in and fifteen in a number of these newly developed ingredients have been used in flavor and fragrance compounds  and in new ingredients and technologies are expected to play an important role in meeting the company s growth objectives 
moving forward  the company is committed to

research and development efforts in those aspects of flavors and fragrances and associated delivery mechanisms which the company has identified as most likely to drive profitable future growth 
the company anticipates that much of this research will be conducted internally  but such efforts may be augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of technology 
an essential aspect of the overall research efforts is the company s continued leadership in sensory science and consumer insight  enabling the creation of consumer preferred flavors and fragrances

market risk the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity price fluctuations 
the company evaluates and manages volatility relating to these exposures on a global basis to take advantage  where applicable  of netting opportunities that may exist 
identified net exposures are managed employing a number of techniques including  but not limited to  borrowings in local currencies and the use of certain derivative instruments 
the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of its products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union  mexico  brazil  china  indonesia  australia and japan  although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar 
the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which it operates  and employs a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  including foreign currency hedging activities 
the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables  and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations

the company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at december  critical accounting policies and use of estimates preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures 
these estimates are based on management s best judgment of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future 
actual results may ultimately differ from estimates  although management does not believe such changes will materially affect the financial statements in any individual year 
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the company s financial reporting involve the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
the company currently has net intangible assets  including goodwill  of goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually 
in assessing its intangible assets  management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available  current market based assumptions and independent valuation experts 
a two step approach is employed 
the first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the second step  if necessary  is to measure the value of the impairment loss  if any 
management s most subjective assumptions relate to the estimated projected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast 
the analysis and evaluation of collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company sells to large global and regional firms 
the majority of sales are either made to order or products that the company also employs in its own manufacturing process as a raw material 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivable balances  including assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers  and in evaluating varying circumstances that may impact the financial stability of a customer 
allowances for loss on collection are established based on currently available relevant facts  and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
the company s historical experience indicates the allowance recorded has been sufficient to cover any reasonably expected potential loss 
the analysis and evaluation of income taxes 
the company accounts for taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for income taxes 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  based on tax laws as currently enacted 
the provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions 
the company may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by the company may not be sustained 
the company regularly updates these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities  where changing circumstances  rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs 
the company is subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters  as well as environmental related matters 
significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 
the company regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information  in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters  and other relevant independent experts 
to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated  the company recognizes a corresponding liability  if the reasonably estimated liability is a range  the company recognizes that amount considered most likely  or in the absence of such a determination  the minimum reasonably expected liability 
to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies  the company separately evaluates the likelihood of recovery and accounts for any related insurance receivable 
management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred  the reasonably estimated amount of that liability  and any potential insurance recovery 
the company regularly evaluates its potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and with respect to the viability of other potentially responsible parties prp s associated with its exposure 
recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available 
critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp s to share such costs 
determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations 
amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled  rates of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
with respect to the us plans  the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation  real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate 
the benchmark asset allocation was in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield  employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield  and in equity investments with a long term expected yield of 
the inflation rate assumed in the model was 
the plan has achieved a compound annual rate of return of over the previous years 
the expected annual rate of return for the non us plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments  inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements 
the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency 
additionally  for the us plan  the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody s aa rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan 
the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 
management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions  including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances 
changes in pension and other post employment benefits  and associated expenses  may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the impact that a 
decrease in the discount rate or a change in the medical cost trend rate would have on the company s pension and other post employment benefit expense  as applicable  is discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory  given the large number of natural ingredients employed  the quality of which may be diminished over time 
the company maintains between and of its inventory as raw materials  providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use 
materials are evaluated based on shelf life  known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product sales mix 
management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 
management believes that it has considered relevant circumstances that the company may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the company for the years presented 
management has discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors
