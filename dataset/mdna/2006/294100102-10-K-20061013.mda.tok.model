item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
see forward looking and cautionary statements 
because of the foregoing factors  you should not rely on past financial results as an indication of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results to date are not necessarily meaningful and expect that our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period in the future 
the company is a life sciences and biotechnology company focused on harnessing genetic processes to develop research tools and therapeutics and the provision of diagnostic services to the medical community 
since its founding in  enzo s strategic focus has been on the development  for commercial purposes  of enabling technologies in the life sciences field 
enzo s pioneering work in genomic analysis coupled with its extensive patent estate and enabling platforms have strategically positioned enzo to play a crucially important role in the rapidly growing life sciences and molecular medicine marketplaces the company is comprised of three interconnected operating companies that have evolved out of enzo s core competence the use of nucleic acids as informational molecules and the use of compounds for immune modulation 
these wholly owned operating companies conduct their operations through three segments 
below are brief descriptions of each of the three operating segments see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements enzo life sciences is a company that manufacturers  develops and markets biomedical research products and tools to research and pharmaceutical customers around the world and has amassed a large patent and technology portfolio 
the pioneering platforms developed by enzo life sciences enable the development of a wide range of products in the research products marketplace 
enzo therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company that has developed multiple novel approaches in the areas of gastrointestinal  infectious  ophthalmic and metabolic diseases  many of which are derived from the pioneering work of enzo life sciences 
the company has focused its efforts on developing treatment regimens for diseases and conditions in which current treatment options are ineffective  costly  and or cause unwanted side effects 
this focus has generated a clinical and preclinical pipeline  as well as more than patents and patent applications 
enzo clinical labs is a regional clinical laboratory to the greater new york and new jersey medical community 
the company believes having this capability allows us to capitalize firsthand on our extensive advanced molecular and cytogenetic capabilities and the broader trends in predictive diagnostics 
we offer a menu of routine and esoteric clinical laboratory tests or procedures used in general patient care by physicians to establish or support a diagnosis  monitor treatment or medication  or search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition 
we operate a full service clinical laboratory in farmingdale  new york  a network of patient service centers  a stand alone stat or rapid response laboratory in new york city  and a full service phlebotomy department 
the company s sources of revenue from the life sciences segment have been from the direct sales of products consisting of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets  as well as through non exclusive distribution agreements with other companies and royalty income 
another source of revenue has been from the clinical laboratory service market 
payments for clinical laboratory testing services are made by the medicare program  healthcare insurers and patients 
fees billed to patients  medicare  and third party payers are billed on the laboratory s standard gross fee schedule  subject to any limitations on fees negotiated with the third party payers or with the ordering physicians on behalf of their patients 
the company incurs additional costs as a result of our participation in the medicare programs  as billing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing is subject to considerable and complex federal regulations 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations  as well as internal compliance policies and procedures  adds further complexity and costs to our operations 
government payers such as medicare  as well as healthcare insurers have taken steps and may continue to take steps to control the costs  utilizations and delivery of healthcare services  including clinical laboratory services 
principally as a result of reimbursement reductions and measures adopted by the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  which establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes in the reimbursement process to control utilization 
despite the added cost and complexity of participating in the medicare program  we continue to participate because we believe that our other business may depend  in part  on continued participation in medicare since certain ordering physicians may want a single laboratory capable of performing all of their clinical laboratory testing services  regardless of who pays for such services 
information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of the clinical laboratory operations  including testing  billing  customer service  logistics  and management of medical data 
our success depends  in part  on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 
through maintenance  staffing  and investments in our information technology system  we expect to limit the risk associated with our heavy reliance on these systems 
the clinical laboratory is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash flows 
typically  testing volume declines during the summer months  year end holiday periods and other major holidays  reducing net revenues and operating cash flows 
testing volume is also subject to declines in winter months due to inclement weather  which varies in severity from year to year

contractual obligations the company has entered into various real estate and equipment operating leases and has employment agreements with certain executive officers 
the real estate lease for the company s farmingdale headquarters is with a related party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these various leases 
the following is a summary of future payments under the company s contractual obligations as of july  payments due by period less than in s total year years years over years real estate and equipment leases      employment agreements   total contractual cash obligations      management is not aware of any material claims  disputes or settled matters concerning third party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements 
the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon enzo biochem  inc consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contractual adjustments  allowance for uncollectible accounts  inventory  intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when the products are shipped  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company has certain non exclusive distribution agreements  which provide for consideration to be paid to the distributors for the manufacture of certain products 
the company records such consideration provided to distributors under these non exclusive distribution agreements as a reduction to research product revenues 
the company did not recognize any revenue from these distributors during the year ended july  during the fiscal years ended july   and  the manufacturing and processing cost of these products sold was million  and million  respectively 
the revenue from these non exclusive distribution agreements are recognized when shipments are made to their respective customers and reported to the company 
royalties royalty revenues are recorded in the period earned 
royalties received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenues 
revenues clinical laboratory services revenues from the clinical laboratory are recognized upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reported to the ordering physician 
these revenues and the associated accounts receivable are based on gross amounts billed or billable for services rendered  net of a contractual adjustment  which is the difference between amounts billed to payers and the expected approved reimbursable settlements from such payers 
the following are tables of the clinical laboratory segment s net revenues and percentages by revenue category for the years ended july  and net revenues year ended year ended july  july  revenue category in s in in s in medicare   third party carriers   patient self pay   hmo s   total   the company provides services to certain patients covered by various third party payers  including the federal medicare program 
revenue  net of contractual adjustments  from direct billings under the federal medicare program during the years ended july   and were approximately  and  respectively  of the clinical lab segment s revenue 
laws and regulations governing medicare are complex and subject to interpretation for which action for noncompliance includes fines  penalties and exclusion from the medicare programs 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing 
contractual adjustments the company s estimate of contractual adjustments is based on significant assumptions and judgments  such as its interpretation of the applicable payer s reimbursement policies  and bears the risk of change 
the estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers  versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers 
the contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue  based on gross billing rates  to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed 
the company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate periodically  based on its evaluation of historical settlement experience with payers  industry reimbursement trends  and other relevant factors 
during the years ended july   and  the contractual adjustment percentages  determined using average historical reimbursement statistics  were  and and  respectively  of gross billings 
the company estimates by using a sensitivity analysis that each point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could have resulted in a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately  for the year ended july   and could have resulted result in a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately  as of july  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at realizable value  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue 
for the clinical laboratory segment  the allowance for doubtful accounts represents amounts that the company does not expect to collect after the company has exhausted its collection procedures 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts in the period the related services are billed and adjusts the estimate in future accounting periods as necessary 
it bases the estimate for the allowance on the evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of accounts receivable  the historical doubtful account write off percentages  payer mix  and other relevant factors 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes the balances  after receipt of the approved settlements from third party payers for the insufficient diagnosis information received from the ordering physician  which result in denials of payment  and the uncollectible portion of receivables from self payers  including deductibles and copayments  which are subject to credit risk and patients ability to pay 
during the years ended july  and  the company determined an allowance for doubtful accounts less than days and wrote off of accounts receivable for all payers over days  as it assumed those accounts are uncollectible 
the company adjusts the historical collection analysis for recoveries  if any  on an ongoing basis 
the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the allowance estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectibility of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
should circumstances change eg shift in payer mix  decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables  our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
the following is a table of the company s net accounts receivable by segment 
the clinical laboratory segment s net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables at july  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s net accounts receivable relates to its clinical laboratory business  which operates in the new york and new jersey metropolitan area

under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is not more likely than not the benefits will be realized in the foreseeable future 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under the liability method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
work in process and finished goods inventories consist of material  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimate of sales forecasts based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimate of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
at july  and  our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was  and  respectively
