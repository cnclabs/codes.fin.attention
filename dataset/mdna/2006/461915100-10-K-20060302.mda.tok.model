item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
see certain factors that may affect future results herein 
overview we provide asset administration services for the financial services industry through our wholly owned subsidiary  investors bank trust company 
we provide core services and value added services to a variety of financial asset managers  including mutual fund complexes  investment advisors  family offices  banks and insurance companies 
core services include middle office outsourcing  global custody  multicurrency accounting and fund administration 
value added services include securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency  investment advisory services  lines of credit and brokerage and transition management services 
we have offices located in the united states  ireland  canada  the cayman islands and the united kingdom with a vast global subcustodian network established to accommodate the international needs of our clients 
at december   we provided services for approximately trillion in net assets  including approximately trillion in foreign net assets 
we grow our business by selling our services to new clients and by further penetrating our existing clients 
we believe that we service approximately of the assets managed by our existing clients  and we have traditionally achieved significant success in growing client relationships 
our ability to service new clients and expand our relationships with existing clients depends on our provision of superior client service 
our growth is also affected by conditions in the global securities markets  the interest rate environment  the regulatory environment for us and our clients and the success of our clients in marketing their products 
we derive our asset servicing revenue from providing core and value added services 
we derive our net interest income by investing the cash balances our clients leave on deposit with us 
since we price our service offerings on a bundled basis  our share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total compensation that our clients pay us for servicing their assets 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  we analyze all expected revenue and expenses 
we believe net operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income and net income are the most meaningful measures of our financial results 
as an asset administration services company  the amount of net operating revenue that we generate is impacted by overall market conditions  client activity and the prevailing interest rate environment 
a significant portion of our core services revenue is based upon the amount of assets we process 
as market values of underlying assets fluctuate  so will our revenue 
we have managed this volatility by offering a tiered pricing structure for our asset based fees 
as asset values increase  the basis point fee is reduced for the incremental assets 
when asset values decrease  revenue is only impacted at the then marginal rate 
many of our value added services are transactional based  and we receive a fee for each transaction processed 
we have continued to experience net interest margin compression during due to a relatively flat yield curve  lower reinvestment spreads and the liability sensitive nature of our balance sheet 
because we are a liability sensitive institution  as overnight interest rates rise  most of our liabilities reprice but our assets take longer to reprice due to the nature of their reset provisions ie  monthly  quarterly and annually 
the lower interest rate spreads we experienced in were also due to the narrowing of market spreads on reinvestment and purchase opportunities for fixed and floating rate investment assets 
in  we expect to see short term rates continue to rise and a continued very flat yield curve 
we remain focused on our sales efforts  prudent expense management and increasing our operating efficiency 
these goals are complicated by the need to build infrastructure to support our growth  the need to maintain state of the art systems and the need to retain and motivate our workforce 
in  we settled a tax assessment with the commonwealth of massachusetts 
in march  a retroactive change in the commonwealth of massachusetts tax law disallowed a dividends received deduction taken by the bank on dividends it had received since from a wholly owned real estate investment trust 
during the second quarter of  we settled this disputed tax assessment with the massachusetts department of revenue  agreeing to pay approximately of the liability 
as a result of this change in tax law  we recorded an additional state tax expense of approximately million  net of federal income tax benefit  in in our and earnings releases  we reported non gaap operating income and non gaap operating earnings per share information that exclude the effect of the state tax assessment settlement discussed above 
we believe that non gaap operating earnings provide a more meaningful presentation of our results of operations because they do not include the one time tax charge which was unrelated to our core operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation between net income and earnings per share presented on the face of our statements of income and the non gaap measure of net operating income referenced in our earnings releases dollars in thousands  except per share data gaap earnings for the year ended december  income before taxes provision for income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted non gaap operating earnings for the year ended december  income before taxes provision for income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted provision for income taxes for the year ended december  excludes a million charge  net of federal income tax benefit  that resulted from a retroactive change in the commonwealth of massachusetts tax law enacted in the first quarter of and the company s subsequent settlement of the resulting tax assessment with the massachusetts department of revenue 
the effect of the exclusions is an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following accounting policies that  as a result of the complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in significant changes to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
senior management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
derivative financial instruments cash flow hedge accounting requires that we measure the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges as compared to changes in expected cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions for each reporting period 
this process involves the estimation of the expected future cash flows of hedged transactions 
interest rate swaps are valued using a nationally recognized swap valuation model 
the libor london interbank offered rate curve in this model serves as the basis for computing the market value of the swap portfolio 
if short term interest rates increase  as they did during  we would expect the swaps to gain in value 
conversely  if short term interest rates decrease  we would expect there to be a corresponding decline in the market value of the swap portfolio 
the measurement of fair value of our derivatives portfolio is based upon market interest rate curve and spreads 
defined benefit pension assumptions each fiscal year  we must assess and select the discount rate  compensation increase percentage and average return on plan assets assumptions in order to determine our net periodic pension cost and to project our benefit obligations under our defined benefit plans 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average yield on high quality fixed income investments that are expected to match the plan s projected cash flows 
the compensation increase percentage is based upon management s current and expected salary increases 
the average return on plan assets is based on the expected return on the plan s current investment portfolio  which can reflect the historical returns of the various asset classes 
for the fiscal year ended december   the discount rate  compensation increase percentage and average return on plan assets used to determine net periodic pension cost for our qualified defined benefit pension plan were  and  respectively 
the discount rate was lower than the rate at december  due to a retraction of the projected yield curve during the year 
the compensation increase assumption at december  was slightly higher by than at december  and the rate of return on plan assets of has remained consistent with the prior year 
net periodic pension expense for the pension plan for  excluding the effect of curtailment  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  we expect the net periodic pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal year at december   the discount rate assumption used to project the benefit obligation for our nonqualified  unfunded  supplemental retirement plan  which covers certain employees  was 
the compensation increase percentage assumption ranged from to at december   which was consistent with the prior year 
the net periodic pension expense for for the supplemental retirement plan  using a discount rate and compensation increase  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the net periodic pension expense is expected to be approximately million in fiscal year new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  with measurement based upon the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation cost related to our share based transactions 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction of sfas r and certain sec regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in april  the sec issued release  which delayed the effective date for sfas r to reporting periods in the first fiscal year beginning after june  accordingly  we adopted sfas r on january   effective for financial periods in there was no impact to our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the accounting and reporting requirements for a change in accounting principle 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in an accounting principle  as well as to changes required by a new accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  and requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for most voluntary changes in an accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
we do not anticipate any material impact to our financial condition or results of operations as a result of the adoption of sfas in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
sfas allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas eliminates the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host  as previously required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedge accounting sfas 
sfas also amends sfas by establishing a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to determine whether they are free standing derivatives or whether they contain embedded derivatives that require bifurcation 
sfas is effective for all hybrid financial instruments acquired or issued by the company on or after january  the company does not anticipate any material impact to its financial condition or results of operations as a result of the adoption of sfas certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees  or information included in our filings with the sec including this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which are made under section e of the securities exchange act of and which involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and are identified by words such as may  could  should  expect  plan  intend  seek  anticipate  believe  estimate  potential  or continue or other comparable terms or the negative of those terms

our actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed in item a of this form k 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in our filings with the sec 
statements of income comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  up from million for the same period in the principal factors contributing to our net income growth were growth in asset servicing fees of and increased gain on sale of investments 
net income growth was partially offset by a increase in operating expenses largely due to new business wins  additional headcount and technology requirements and a decrease in net interest income 
fees and other revenue the components of fees and other revenue are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change total asset servicing fees gain on sale of investments other operating income total fees and other revenue percentage is not considered meaningful 
the largest components of asset servicing fees are custody  multicurrency accounting and fund administration  which increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in custody  multicurrency accounting and fund administration fees are based in part on the value of assets processed 
assets processed is the total dollar value of financial assets on the reported date for which we provide one or more of the following services middle office outsourcing  global custody  multicurrency accounting  fund administration  securities lending  foreign exchange  cash management  performance measurement  institutional transfer agency  investment advisory services  lines of credit and brokerage and transition management services 
the change in net assets processed includes the following components dollars in billions for the year ended for the three months ended december  december  net assets processed  beginning of period change in net assets processed sales to new clients further penetration of existing clients lost clients fund flows and market gain total change in net assets processed net assets processed  end of period the majority of the increase in assets processed was due to sales to new and existing clients  the ability of our clients to develop and sell product  which generates fund flows that have a direct  positive impact on our business  and slightly higher asset values compared to a year ago 
as indicated in the overview section  our core services fees are generated by charging a fee based upon the value of assets processed 
as market values or clients asset levels fluctuate  so will our revenue 
our tiered pricing structure  coupled with minimum and flat fees  allow us to manage this volatility to a certain extent 
as asset values increase  the basis point fee typically lowers 
when asset values decrease  revenue is only impacted by the asset decline at the then marginal rate 
if the value of equity or fixed income assets held by our clients were to increase or decrease by for a sustained period of time  we estimate currently that this market movement  by itself  would cause a corresponding change of less than in our earnings per share 
earnings per share do not track precisely to the value of the equity and fixed income markets because conditions present in a market increase or decrease may generate offsetting increases or decreases in other revenue and expense items that are influenced by the value of the assets we administer 
for example  increased market volatility often results in higher transaction fee revenue 
also  market value declines may result in increased interest income and sweep fee income as clients move larger amounts of assets into the cash management vehicles that we offer 
in addition  our tiered pricing structure reduces the impact of volatility in asset values to a certain extent 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these offsetting revenue and expense movements will occur during any future upturn or downturn in the equity or fixed income markets  or that our tiered pricing structure will reduce the impact on us of a sustained change in asset values 
transaction driven income includes our value added services  such as foreign exchange  cash management  securities lending and investment advisory services 
foreign exchange fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase in foreign exchange fees is attributable to new business  increased volume of client activity and volatility in currency markets 
future foreign exchange income is dependent on the volume of new and existing client activity and overall volatility in the currencies traded 
cash management fees  which consist of sweep fees  were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase is primarily due to higher balances placed by our clients in the cash management products we offer 
cash management revenue will continue to depend on the level of client balances maintained in the cash management products we offer 
if our clients investment products continue to maintain higher cash balances than they did in comparable periods  we expect our cash management revenue to be positively impacted 
securities lending fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in  primarily due to new business  higher volumes and improved market conditions 
securities lending transaction volume is positively affected by the market value of the securities on loan  merger and acquisition activity  increased ipo activity and a steeper short end of the yield curve 
if the capital markets continue to experience the aforementioned characteristics  it is likely that our securities lending revenue will continue to be positively impacted 
if we experience a reduction in our securities lending portfolio  lower market values or compression of the spreads earned on our securities lending activity  our securities lending revenue will likely be negatively impacted 
investment advisory fees were million for the year ended december   down from the same period in the decrease in investment advisory fees is attributable to lower asset values in our proprietary merrimac money market funds combined with advisory fee waivers on certain of the funds 
future investment advisory fee income is dependent upon the asset levels within the merrimac money market funds  which are driven by overall market conditions  client activity and transaction volumes 
we discontinued advisory fee waivers in the second quarter of other service fees for the year ended december  were million  up from the same period in other service fees include income earned on compliance advisory  brokerage and transition management services 
the increase in was due to an increase in compliance and brokerage services 
other operating income for the year ended december  was million  up from the same period in the increase is primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate on our holding of fhlbb stock 
during the year ended december  we sold municipal securities and us treasury securities held in our available for sale portfolio  resulting in the recognition of million in gains 
we sold these securities as part of a strategy to improve the after tax yield of our municipal securities portfolio by replacing the sold municipal securities with those that offer a more attractive after tax yield  as well as to capitalize on strong market conditions 
net interest income the following table presents the components of net interest income dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change interest income interest expense total net interest income net interest income is affected by the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and the movement and level of interest rates 
the decrease in our net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rate spreads  which was partially offset by growth in our investment portfolio 
lower interest rate spreads were due to increasing short term interest rates without a concurrent increase in longer term rates  which resulted in a relatively flat yield curve 
consequently  our interest bearing liabilities  of which the majority is priced based on overnight floating rates  have repriced at higher rates faster than our interest earning assets have repriced  resulting in a lower net interest margin 
in addition  reinvestment and purchase spreads on fixed and floating rate assets were lower than expected due to higher market demand  especially for shorter term and floating rate fixed income investments 
average investment security balances were up approximately billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category dollars in thousands for the year ended december  vs 
december  change due to volume change due to rate net interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements investment securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities change in net interest income amortization and accretion of debt securities purchased at a premium or discount are amortized or accreted into income using a method which approximates the constant effective yield method 
we apply statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases sfas for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
in calculating the effective yield for securities that represent holdings of large numbers of similar loans for which prepayments are probable and the timing and amount of prepayments can be reasonably estimated  prepayments are anticipated using our actual three month prepayment experience 
the amount of amortization or accretion to recognize in income is driven by the calculation of the constant effective yield 
when calculating this yield  we assume that prepayments will continue from the analysis date to the date of the security s expected maturity at our most recent three month prepayment rate 
the prepayment rate is updated monthly based on our previous three month actual prepayment experience 
we utilize three month prepayment rates to anticipate prepayments because such rates are based on our own actual prepayment experience and because we believe three month rates are a better estimate of future experience than either one month or six month or longer rates 
in the opinion of management  a one month rate does not capture enough experience to predict future prepayment behavior and may create undue volatility in interest income due to one time fluctuations in prepayment activity 
conversely  in the opinion of management  a six month or longer rate would not capture enough volatility to predict future prepayment behavior 
if a difference arises between our estimated prepayments and our actual prepayments received  the constant effective yield is recalculated based on our actual payments to date and anticipated future payments 
this monthly recalculation results in the carrying value of the security being adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the purchase date  and a corresponding charge or credit is recognized to interest income 
for securities that do not represent holdings of large numbers of similar loans for which prepayments are probable and the timing and amount of prepayments can be reasonably estimated  the associated premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over their contractual term using the constant effective yield 
actual prepayment experience for such securities is reviewed monthly and a proportionate amount of premium or discount is recognized in income at that time such that the effective yield on the remaining portion of the securities continues unchanged 
as of and for the years ended december    and  we anticipated prepayments on our mortgage backed securities 
all other securities  including federal agency securities  state and political subdivisions  corporate debt  us treasury securities  and foreign government securities do not meet the sfas criteria for anticipating prepayments 
accordingly  no prepayments were anticipated for these securities 
in addition to investing in both variable and fixed rate securities  we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
see the market risk section for more detailed information 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million in  up from the increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits  technology and telecommunications  transaction processing services  travel and sales promotion  loss and loss adjustment expenses and other operating expenses  as detailed below 
the components of operating expenses were as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change compensation and benefits technology and telecommunications transaction processing services depreciation and amortization occupancy professional fees travel and sales promotion loss and loss adjustment expenses insurance other operating expenses total operating expenses percentage is not considered meaningful compensation and benefits increased from due to higher headcount and annual salary increases 
further increases in compensation expense in will be primarily dependant upon sales to new and existing clients  the full year impact of staff additions made in related to the overall growth of our business  annual salary increases and the full year effect of the adoption of sfas r 
technology and telecommunications expense increased from as a result of increased infrastructure investments in the increase is also due to our outsourcing agreement with ibm  which we entered into in july of a portion of the increase is offset by lower compensation costs due to employees transferring to ibm 
also  increases in our processing volumes drove higher technology and telecommunications expense 
generally  we expect technology reinvestment to equal approximately of net operating revenue each year  including related compensation costs 
transaction processing services expense increased from as a result of higher global asset values and transactions with our subcustodians 
future transaction processing servicing expense will be dependent on asset levels and the volume of client transaction activity 
professional fees expense decreased from  primarily due to lower subadvisory expense associated with our merrimac money market funds  resulting from lower average fund balances 
future professional fees are dependent upon changes in the value of the merrimac portfolios and upon other business needs for outside professional services 
travel and sales promotion expense increased from travel and sales promotion expense consists of expenses incurred by the sales force  client management staff and other employees in connection with sales calls on potential clients  as well as traveling to existing client sites and our foreign offices 
the increases resulted from a higher level of travel to client sites  a higher level of sales calls to potential clients  attendance at industry conferences  and travel related to the establishment of our new european offices 
travel and sales expense may increase in  dependent upon new business leads and other client and business needs 
the increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses from to is due to a processing error identified during the fourth quarter of other operating expense increased from primarily as a result of higher recruiting and staffing expense 
we expect other operating expense to increase in due to staffing and recruiting costs as a result of the growth of our business 
income taxes income taxes were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase in income taxes and the effective tax rate excluding the effect of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas apb is primarily attributable to increased pretax earnings as well as a decrease in the percentage of tax exempt income to pretax income 
the increase in income taxes was partially offset by the reversal of a deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of our irish subsidiaries 
during the second quarter of  we recognized the indefinite reversal provision of apb  which specifies that us income taxes should not be recorded on the undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary if those undistributed earnings have been or will be invested indefinitely in that subsidiary 
we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our irish subsidiaries will be permanently invested in our irish operations to support continued growth 
in  we expect that our effective tax rate will approximate of pretax income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  up from million for the same period in the principal factors contributing to our net income growth were growth in asset servicing fees of in addition to a increase in net interest income 
net income growth was partially offset by a increase in operating expenses  largely due to new business  additional headcount and technology requirements 
our income statement for the year ended december  reflects the net effect of the first quarter tax accrual and its later partial reversal resulting from our settlement with the massachusetts department of revenue 
absent the effects of this tax matter  net income for the year ended december  increased from net operating income for the same period in we provide a full reconciliation of this non gaap measure in the overview of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fees and other revenue the components of fees and other revenue are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change total asset servicing fees other operating income gain on sale of investment total fees and other revenue percentage is not considered meaningful the largest components of asset servicing fees are custody  multicurrency accounting and fund administration  which increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the change in net assets processed includes the following components dollars in billions for the year ended december  net assets processed  beginning of period change in net assets processed sales to new clients further penetration of existing clients lost clients fund flows and market gain total change in net assets processed net assets processed  end of period the majority of the increase in assets processed was due to sales to new and existing clients  the ability of our clients to develop and sell product  which generates fund flows that have a direct  positive impact on our business  and higher asset values compared to a year ago 
foreign exchange fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase in foreign exchange fees is attributable to new business  increased volume of client activity and volatility in currency markets 
cash management fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase is primarily due to higher balances placed by our clients in the cash management products we offer 
investment advisory fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in the increase in investment advisory fees is attributable to increased average asset values of the merrimac money market funds  an investment company for which we act as advisor  and where a portion of excess client cash balances are invested 
securities lending fees were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in  primarily due to improved spreads and volumes 
net interest income the following table presents the components of net interest income dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change interest income interest expense total net interest income the improvement in our net interest income was primarily due to balance sheet growth  driven by healthy client funding  partially offset by lower investment spreads 
during we employed a strategy of prepaying high rate borrowings and replacing them with lower cost term funding in order to maintain our net interest margin 
prepayment fees incurred during were million  compared to million during this strategy combined with a rising interest rate environment during the second half of resulted in a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category dollars in thousands for the year ended december  vs 
december  change due to volume change due to rate net interest earning assets fed funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements investment securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities change in net interest income operating expenses total operating expenses were million in  up from the growth in our cost structure was largely driven by the new business that we won during  which required us to invest in headcount and technology 
the components of operating expenses were as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change compensation and benefits technology and telecommunications transaction processing services depreciation and amortization occupancy professional fees travel and sales promotion loss and loss adjustment expenses insurance other operating expenses total operating expenses compensation and benefits increased million  or  from salaries increased due to higher headcount and annual merit raises 
these increases were partially offset by employee costs that shifted to technology and telecommunications expense as part of our outsourcing arrangement with ibm that we initiated in the summer of technology and telecommunications expense increased million  or  from as a result of increased infrastructure investments in as mentioned previously  we entered into an agreement with ibm in the summer of to outsource certain technical infrastructure services 
service expense under this agreement was million during  which included initial start up costs 
the costs of these services were partially offset by decreases in other technology and telecommunications expenses  as the services were previously performed internally or by other service providers 
transaction processing services expense increased from as a result of higher global asset values and transactions with our subcustodians 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from this increase resulted from the completion of capitalized software projects in late and early and their placement into service 
this increase was partially offset by fully depreciated equipment from our assumption of bgi s north american asset administration unit 
professional fees expense increased from  primarily due to increased fees associated with the merrimac money market funds 
the merrimac fees are asset based and grew along with the assets of the portfolios during also in  we incurred additional technical consulting fees as we hired external consultants to assist with technology initiatives 
travel and sales promotion expense increased from insurance expense was up from in may  our five year fixed rate insurance policy expired  resulting in increased premiums 
other operating expense increased from the primary contributors to the increase included higher regulatory assessments due to higher deposit liabilities  higher recruiting expense due to increased staffing needs  increased advertising expense and increased miscellaneous office expense due to the overall growth of our business 
income taxes income taxes were million for the year ended december   up from the same period in this increase is attributable to a increase in pretax earnings for the year ended december  from the same period in the following tables present average balances  interest income and expense  and yields earned or paid on the major categories of assets and liabilities for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  average balance interest average yield cost average balance interest average yield cost average balance interest average yield cost interest earning assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements investment securities mortgage backed securities federal agency securities state and political securities other securities total investment securities loans total interest earning assets allowance for loan losses noninterest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits demand savings time securities sold under repurchase agreements junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits savings noninterest bearing time deposits other liabilities total liabilities equity total liabilities and equity net interest income net interest margin average interest rate spread ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities average yield cost on available for sale securities is based on amortized cost 
average yield cost on demand loans includes only performing loan balances 
during the years ended december   and there were no non performing loan balances 
interest expense includes penalties of million in for prepayment of two term repurchase agreements 
effective october   the company adopted the provisions of fin revised december  which resulted in the deconsolidation of investors capital trust i  the trust that holds the trust preferred securities 
interest expense includes contractual prepayment penalties of million and million in and  respectively  for prepayment of certain fhlbb borrowings 
net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
yield on interest earning assets less rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
financial condition at december   our total assets were billion  up from december  average interest earning assets increased billion  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
our asset growth was primarily funded by increases in average external borrowings  including repurchase agreements  of approximately billion for the year ended december  investment portfolio the income we derive from our investment portfolio is generated primarily by investing client cash balances and is a component of our asset processing business 
in addition  we use the investment portfolio to secure open positions at securities clearing institutions in connection with our custody services 
the following table summarizes our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities federal agency securities state and political subdivisions total securities held to maturity securities available for sale mortgage backed securities state and political subdivisions corporate debt us treasury securities federal agency securities foreign government securities total securities available for sale the billion  or  increase in our held to maturity securities portfolio from december  to december  is primarily due to investment security purchases allowing us to utilize our capital  while maintaining an acceptable risk profile 
our investment security purchases primarily consisted of floating interest rate mortgage backed securities which offer an attractive yield and reprice as interest rates increase 
our held to maturity portfolio securities are purchased with the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are not viewed as our primary source of funds to satisfy liquidity needs 
our available for sale securities portfolio decreased billion  or from december  to december  the decrease was mainly due to sales of us treasuries and municipal securities during and investment security maturities and prepayments  partially offset by purchases of investment securities 
our investment security purchases primarily included mortgage backed securities and municipal securities 
we believe that purchasing these securities allows us to take advantage of attractive yields and cash flows which aligns with our asset and liability strategy 
refer to the gap analysis under the market risk section for additional details regarding the matching of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the average balance of our investment securities for the year ended december  was billion  with an average yield of  compared to an average balance of billion with an average yield of during the same period in the increase in yield is primarily due to our variable rate securities repricing at higher interest rates 
anticipating prepayments in calculating the constant effective yield for mortgage backed securities may result in more monthly earnings volatility due to the impact of changing interest rates and the resulting adjustments to the amount of amortization 
a rising rate environment will generally decrease the rate of prepayments  which may have the effect of lengthening the expected maturity of mortgage backed securities 
accordingly  the amount of amortization recognized each period will decline  but the same total net premium will be spread over a longer time horizon  thereby increasing net income in the then current period 
in a decreasing rate environment  the rate of prepayments generally increases  which may have the effect of shortening the expected maturity of the mortgage backed securities and therefore increasing the amount of amortization  thereby decreasing net income in the then current period 
we do not expect changes to our amount of amortization resulting from anticipating prepayments to have a material effect on our future reported financial results or financial condition 
prepayment cash flow levels on our federal agency securities increased in  which we believe were attributable to the expiration of borrower prepayment penalties  increased refinancing and loan payoff activity 
mortgaged backed security prepayment cash flow levels also increased for most of  primarily attributable to increased refinancing opportunities 
we invest in mortgage backed securities and federal agency securities to increase the total return of the investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities and federal agency bonds generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty  such as the federal agency issuing the securities  is unable to meet the terms of the contract 
credit risk related to mortgage backed securities and federal agency bonds is substantially reduced by payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
prepayment risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates and other economic factors will result in investment securities being paid off earlier than the scheduled maturity date 
refer to the market risk section for additional details regarding our net interest income simulation model  which includes the impact of changes in interest rates  and therefore prepayment risk  on our net interest income 
we invest in aaa rated  insured municipal securities to generate stable  tax advantaged income 
municipal securities generally have lower stated yields than federal agency and us treasury securities  but their after tax yields are comparable 
municipal securities are subject to call risk 
call risk is similar to prepayment risk and results from the possibility that fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in the exercise of the call option by the issuing municipality prior to the maturity date of the bond

loan portfolio our loan portfolio increased million  or  from to primarily due to an increase in loans to mutual funds 
the following table summarizes our loan portfolio for the dates indicated dollars in thousands december  loans to mutual funds loans to individuals loans to others less allowance for loan losses net loans floating rate fixed rate gross loans we make loans to individually managed account customers and to mutual funds and other pooled product clients 
we offer overdraft protection and lines of credit to our clients for the purpose of funding redemptions  covering overnight cash shortfalls  leveraging portfolios and meeting other client borrowing needs 
the majority of loans to individually managed account customers are written on a demand basis  bear variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or the federal funds rate and are fully secured by liquid collateral  primarily freely tradable securities held in custody by us for the borrower 
we monitor the value of collateral daily to ensure the amount of collateral held by us exceeds the loan balance by a certain threshold 
loans to mutual funds and other pooled product clients include unsecured lines of credit that may  in the event of default  be collateralized at our option by securities held in custody by us for those clients 
loans to individually managed account customers  mutual funds and other pooled product clients also include advances that we make to certain clients pursuant to the terms of our custody agreements with those clients to facilitate securities transactions and redemptions 
at december   our only lending concentrations that exceeded of total loan balances were the lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
we periodically issue lines of credit and advances to our mutual fund clients to help those clients with security transactions 
the president of one of our clients is a related party to james m 
oates  a member of our board of directors 
at december   we had total contractual agreements for million of committed lines of credit with two mutual funds within the related party complex the mutual funds 
the primary source of repayment of the loans is the proceeds from the sale of investments in the normal course of the mutual funds business 
as part of the agreement  the mutual funds are required to segregate and maintain specific collateral for us equal to of the lines of credit 
at december   loans due from the mutual funds totaled million 
there were no loans outstanding from any related party mutual fund complex at december  in january  we entered into a million committed line of credit agreement with a series of trusts the trusts 
edward f 
hines  a member of our board of directors  is a trustee of the trusts and is a partner in the firm that manages the assets held in the trusts 
the line of credit is secured by assets of the trusts  which assets are held by investors bank as custodian 
the primary source of repayment of the loans is the proceeds from the sale of investments in the normal course of the trusts business 
the terms and conditions of our contractual agreements with the mutual funds and trusts discussed above  including collateral requirements  lending limits and fees  are consistent with other lending clients that have similar composition  size and overall business relationships with us 
also  mr 
oates and mr 
hines abstain from voting on any board matter involving the proposed transactions with the mutual funds and trusts  respectively  discussed above 
our loan portfolio credit performance has been excellent 
there have been no loan charge offs in the history of our company 
it is our policy to place a loan on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no loans on nonaccrual status  no loans greater than days past due  and no troubled debt restructurings 
although virtually all of our loans are fully collateralized with freely tradable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has an allowance for loan losses of million at december   a level which has remained consistent for the past five years 
this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
deposits total deposits were billion at december   down from december  the decrease in our deposit balances is a result of our clients being more fully invested in the equity and fixed income markets 
time deposits with balances greater than  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
all time deposits had a maturity of less than three months at december  and repurchase agreements and short term and other borrowings asset growth was funded in part by increased securities sold under repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements increased billion  or  from december  to december  the majority of our repurchase agreements are with clients who prefer a more collateralized form of deposit 
repurchase agreements provide for the sale of securities for cash coupled with the obligation to repurchase those securities on a set date or on demand 
we use repurchase agreements  including client repurchase agreements  because they provide a lower cost source of funding than other short term borrowings and allow our clients the extra benefit of collateralization of their deposits 
the average balance of securities sold under repurchase agreements for the year ended december  was billion with an average cost of approximately  compared to an average balance of billion and an average cost of approximately for the same period in the increase in the average cost of repurchase agreements was due to higher short term interest rates in compared to the average cost of securities sold under repurchase agreements for the year ended december  included penalties of million for the prepayment of two term repurchase agreements 
these penalties were incurred to employ an asset and liability strategy in which we replaced high rate borrowings with lower cost term funding 
there were no prepayment penalties for the year ended december  the following table represents information regarding our securities sold under repurchase agreements dollars in thousands december  december  december  outstanding at end of period maximum outstanding at any month end average balance for the year weighted average rate at end of period weighted average rate for the period short term and other borrowings increased billion  or  from december  to december  we use short term and other borrowings to offset the variability of deposit flow 
the average balance of short term and other borrowings for the year ended december  was billion with an average cost of approximately  compared to an average balance of billion and an average cost of approximately for the same period in the increase in the average cost of short term and other borrowings was due to an increase in short term rates during compared to the average cost of borrowings for the year ended december  included penalties of million for the prepayment of certain fhlbb borrowings 
as discussed above  these penalties were incurred to employ an asset and liability strategy in which we replaced high rate borrowings with lower cost term funding 
there were no prepayment penalties for the year ended december  the following table represents information regarding our federal funds purchased dollars in thousands december  december  december  outstanding at end of period maximum outstanding at any month end average balance for the year weighted average rate at end of period weighted average rate for the period market risk our clients  in the course of their financial asset management  maintain cash balances  which they can deposit with us on a short term basis in interest bearing accounts or client repurchase agreements 
we either directly invest these cash balances to earn interest income  or place these deposits in third party vehicles and remit a portion of the earnings on these investments to our clients after deducting a fee as our compensation for investing clients funds in these investment vehicles 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in market prices and interest rates 
the level of risk we assume is a function of our overall strategic objectives and liquidity needs  client requirements and market volatility 
the active management of market risk is integral to our operations 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest income under various economic conditions 
our balance sheet is primarily subject to interest rate risk  which is the risk of loss due to movements in interest rates 
prepayment risk  which is the risk that changes in interest rates and other economic factors will result in investment securities being paid off earlier than the scheduled maturity date  is inherent in our investment securities  mainly our mortgage backed securities and federal agency bond portfolios 
prepayment levels for mortgage backed securities are primarily driven by changes in interest rates 
prepayment levels for federal agency securities are driven by a number of factors  including expiration of prepayment penalty provisions  the economic condition of the borrower  borrower refinancing alternatives  and interest rates 
our board of directors has set asset and liability management policies that define the overall framework for managing interest rate sensitivity  including accountabilities and controls over investment activities 
these policies delineate investment limits and strategies that are appropriate  given our liquidity and regulatory requirements 
for example  we have established a policy limit stating that projected net interest income over the next twelve months will not be impacted by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points or over twelve months 
each quarter  our board of directors reviews our asset and liability positions  including simulations of the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our capital 
the day to day responsibility for oversight of the asset and liability management function has been delegated by our board of directors to our asset and liability committee alco 
alco is a senior management committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the president  the chief financial officer  the chief risk officer and members of the treasury function 
alco meets twice monthly 
our primary tool in managing interest rate sensitivity is an income simulation model 
key assumptions in the simulation model include the timing of cash flows  which include forecasted prepayment speeds that are based on market and industry data  maturities and repricing of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  capital planning and deposit sensitivity 
the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities will change over the period being measured 
the model also assumes that the change in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve across all maturities 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely predict the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the results of the income simulation model as of both december  and indicated that an upward shift of interest rates by basis points over a twelve month period would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of approximately  which is within our policy limit 
we also simulate a basis point rate reduction over a twelve month period 
this modified simulation would result in an increase in projected net interest income of approximately at december  and would have approximately impact at december   both within our policy limit 
we also use gap analysis as a secondary tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity 
gap analysis involves measurement of the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time frame 
a positive gap indicates that more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
by seeking to minimize the net amount of assets and liabilities that could reprice in the same time frame  we attempt to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
as shown in the cumulative gap position in the table presented below  at december   interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than interest earning assets in the short term 
generally speaking  during a period of falling interest rates  net interest income would be higher than it would have been until interest rates stabilize 
during a period of rising interest rates  net interest income would be lower than it would have been until interest rates stabilize 
other important determinants of net interest income are the shape of the yield curve  general rate levels  reinvestment spreads  balance sheet growth and mix  and interest rate spreads 
we continue to run a closely matched balance sheet by investing the majority of our assets in short duration  variable rate securities and adding interest rate swaps against client liabilities  including client repurchase agreements 
we manage the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by adjusting their mix  yield  maturity and or repricing characteristics based on market conditions 
client deposits and repurchase agreements  which are predominantly short term  are our primary sources of funds 
short term wholesale funding is used to replace temporary deposit outflows and support balance sheet growth 
we also use term borrowings and interest rate swap agreements to augment our management of interest rate risk 
the effect of the swap agreements is to lengthen both a forecasted series of fixed rate overnight liabilities incurred at different daily fixed rates and short term variable rate liabilities into longer term fixed rate liabilities 
the weighted average fixed payment rates were and at december  and  respectively 
variable interest payments received are currently indexed to the overnight federal funds rate 
at december  and  the weighted average rate of variable market indexed interest payment obligations to the company were and  respectively 
the remaining terms of swaps range from to months 
these contracts had net fair values of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively

fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid 
mortgage backed securities are included in the pricing category that corresponds with the earlier of their first repricing date or principal paydown schedule generated from industry sourced prepayment projections 
excludes million of unsettled securities purchases and million of net unrealized losses as of december  liquidity liquidity represents the ability of an institution to meet present and future financial obligations through either runoff due to prepayments  asset sales  maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
for a financial institution such as ours  these obligations arise from the withdrawals of deposits  the payment of operating expenses  and the inclusion of capital expenditures for fixed assets and leasehold improvements 
our primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  new deposits  short term borrowings  interest and principal payments on securities held to maturity and available for sale  fees collected from asset administration clients  fhlbb borrowings and federal reserve discount window borrowings 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and our ability to generate liquidity through liability funds  management believes that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to meet our depositors needs  to satisfy our operating requirements and to fund the payment of an anticipated annual cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock for approximately million based upon  shares outstanding as of december  
our ability to pay dividends on common stock may depend on the receipt of dividends from the bank 
any dividend payments by the bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the massachusetts commissioner of banks 
during all periods presented in this report  the company did not require dividends from the bank in order to fund the company s own dividends 
in addition  we may not pay dividends on our common stock if we are in default under certain agreements entered into in connection with the sale of our capital securities 
the capital securities were issued in by investors capital trust i  a delaware statutory business trust sponsored by us  and qualify as tier capital under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
in july  we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock in the open market over the next twelve months 
the purchase of our common stock has been funded primarily by a dividend from the bank to the company 
we do not expect the stock purchase program to have a material impact on our liquidity position  our risk based capital ratios  including our leverage capital ratio  or our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased million of our common stock 
we have informal borrowing arrangements with various counterparties 
each counterparty has agreed to make funds available to us at the federal funds overnight rate 
each counterparty may terminate its arrangement at any time and is under no contractual obligation to provide us with requested funding 
our borrowings under these arrangements are typically on a short term basis 
we cannot be certain  however  that such funding will be available 
lack of availability of liquid funds could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we also have master repurchase agreements in place with various counterparties 
each counterparty has agreed on an uncommitted basis to make funds available to us at various rates in exchange for collateral consisting of marketable securities 
on april   the fhlbb implemented a new capital structure mandated for all federal home loan banks subject to the gramm leach bliley act of and regulations that were subsequently promulgated in by the fhlbb s regulator  the federal housing finance board 
the bank s capital stock investment in the fhlbb totaled million as of december  the million capital stock investment includes both a million membership component and a million activity based component 
under the new capital plan  fhlbb capital stock investments require a five year advance notice of withdrawal 
recent changes to the fhlbb capital plan have resulted in an increased borrowing capacity 
the bank s million capital stock investment in the fhlbb provides an overnight borrowing capacity of up to million 
the amount outstanding under this arrangement at december  was million 
additional borrowing is available to the bank based on prescribed collateral levels and increased investment in fhlbb capital stock 
the bank currently has no plans to increase its investment in fhlbb capital stock 
the following table details our contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations debt obligations repurchase agreements junior subordinated debentures operating lease obligations total debt obligations presented are variable in nature and do not include interest amounts 
these securities ultimately mature in  however  we have the right to redeem the securities as early as payments due by period less than more than total year years years years other commitments unused commitments to lend fixed price purchase contracts other total included in the other commitments line presented above are contracts in which we are obligated to utilize the data processing services of electronic data systems through december   sei investments company through december  and international business machines corporation through june  the commitments to pay for these services are based upon transaction volumes and include inflationary price clauses 
capital resources historically  we have financed our operations principally through internally generated cash flows 
we incur capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures  capitalized software and miscellaneous equipment needs 
we lease office space and computing equipment through operating leases 
capital expenditures have been incurred and leases entered into on an as required basis  primarily to meet our growing operating needs 
as a result  our capital expenditures were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were comprised of approximately million in capitalized software and projects in process  million in fixed assets and million in leasehold improvements 
for the year ended december   capital expenditures were comprised of approximately million in capitalized software and projects in process  million in fixed assets and million in leasehold improvements 
stockholders equity at december  was million  up from  primarily due to net income earned  net of our stock repurchase program 
the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets remained constant at approximately for december  and in july  we announced that our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock in the open market over the next twelve months 
we do not expect our stock purchase program to have a material impact on our capital resources  such as maintaining risk based capital ratios in excess of capital adequacy guidelines and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased million of our common stock 
the frb has adopted capital adequacy guidelines applicable to united states banking organizations 
the frb s capital adequacy guidelines generally require bank holding companies bhcs to maintain total capital equal to of total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items the total risk based capital ratio  with at least of that amount consisting of tier  or core capital  and the remaining amount consisting of tier  or supplementary capital 
tier capital for bhcs generally consists of the sum of common stockholders equity and perpetual preferred stock subject to certain limitations  less goodwill and other nonqualifying intangible assets 
tier capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities  perpetual preferred stock  not included as tier capital  term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  and  subject to limitations  general allowances for loan and lease losses 
assets are adjusted under the risk based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements  the frb requires bhcs to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier capital to its average total consolidated assets the leverage ratio of 
total average consolidated assets for this purpose does not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the frb determines should be deducted from tier capital 
the frb has announced that the leverage ratio requirement is the minimum for the top rated bhcs 
all other bhcs are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
bhcs with supervisory  financial  operational or managerial weaknesses  as well as bhcs that are anticipating or experiencing significant growth  are expected to maintain capital ratios well above the minimum levels 
because we anticipate significant future growth  we will be required to maintain a leverage ratio of or higher 
we are currently in compliance with both the total risk based capital ratio and the leverage ratio requirements  and management expects these ratios to remain in compliance with the frb s capital adequacy guidelines 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio were and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements lines of credit at december   we had commitments to mutual funds and individuals under collateralized open lines of credit totaling billion  against which million in loans were drawn 
the credit risk involved in issuing lines of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending demand loans 
we do not anticipate any loss as a result of these lines of credit 
securities lending on behalf of our clients  we lend securities to creditworthy broker dealers 
in certain circumstances  we may indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
we require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to  or in excess of  of the fair market value of us dollar denominated securities borrowed and of the fair market value of non us dollar denominated securities borrowed 
the borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine whether additional collateral is necessary 
as guarantor  we are required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we measure the fair value of our indemnification obligation by marking our securities lending portfolio to market on a daily basis and comparing the value of the portfolio to the collateral holdings position 
the fair value of the indemnification obligation to be recorded would be the deficiency of collateral as compared to the value of the securities out on loan 
with respect to the indemnified securities lending portfolio  the cash and us government securities held by us as collateral at december  totaled billion while the fair value of the portfolio totaled approximately billion 
given that the value of the collateral held was in excess of the value of the securities that we would be required to replace if the borrower defaulted and failed to return such securities  our indemnification obligation was zero and no liability was recorded 
all securities loans are categorized as overnight loans 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make would be equal to the market value of the securities borrowed 
since the securities loans are overcollateralized by for us dollar denominated securities to for non us dollar denominated securities of the fair market value of the loan made  the collateral held by us would be used to satisfy the obligation 
in addition  each borrowing agreement includes set off language that allows us to use any excess collateral on other loans to that borrower to cover any collateral shortfall of that borrower 
however  there is a potential risk that the collateral would not be sufficient to cover such an obligation if the security on loan increased in value between the time the borrower defaulted and the time the security is bought in 
in those instances  we would buy in the security using all available collateral and a loss would result from the difference between the value of the security bought in and the value of the collateral held 
we have never experienced a broker default
