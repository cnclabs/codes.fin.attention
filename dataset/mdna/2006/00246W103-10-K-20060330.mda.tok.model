item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  we have had to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported on our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based upon our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained  and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we also refer you to our the company and summary of significant accounting policies discussed in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition we manufacture and sell high performance compound semiconductor substrates and sell certain raw materials including gallium  germanium dioxide  and pbn crucibles 
after we ship our products  there are no remaining obligations or customer acceptance requirements that would preclude revenue recognition 
our products are typically sold pursuant to a purchase order placed by our customers  and our terms and conditions of sale do not require customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue upon shipment and transfer of title of products to our customers  which is either upon shipment from our dock  receipt at the customer s dock  or removal from consignment inventory at the customer s location  provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of ownership have transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  and product returns are reasonably estimable 
we do not provide training  installation or commissioning services 
additionally  we do not provide discounts or other incentives to customers except for one customer with whom we agreed in the fourth quarter of to provide a certain amount of cumulative discounts on future product purchases from us 
we recognize these discounts as a reduction in revenue as products are sold to this customer 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience  current economic trends and changes in customer demand at the time revenue is recognized 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a reserve for sales returns of  related to our failure to follow certain testing requirements and provision of testing data and information to certain customers 
this reserve was based on discussions with some of the affected customers and review of specific shipments 
approximately  of the  sales returns reserve has been utilized and approximately  has been reversed to revenue as of december  as we favorably resolved an outstanding matter with a customer 
we will continue to monitor the returns for this specific reserve 
see further discussion in results of operations below 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically review the likelihood of collection on our accounts receivable balances and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable primarily based upon the age of these accounts 
we provide a allowance for us receivables in excess of days and for foreign receivables in excess of days 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including the length of time a receivable balance has been outstanding  our past history with the customer and their credit worthiness 
in previous years  three of our customers had filed for bankruptcy protection 
upon notification of the bankruptcy  we immediately stopped shipping orders to these customers other than on payment in advance 
at that time  the outstanding balances of these customers had been fully reserved 
the related accounts receivable balances and reserve were subsequently written off in november when we finally determined that the balances were uncollectible 
this determination was made as a result of our unsuccessful efforts to collect these accounts receivable  the significant length of time that the receivables balance was outstanding  and the unlikelihood that we would collect the balances from the bankrupt s estate 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was million  which was net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  from our allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december   we wrote off  of fully reserved accounts receivable for a korean customer and decreased the allowance by  due to improved collections mainly from a japanese customer  while increasing the allowance for a large customer in china of  and other doubtful accounts of  resulting in the allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  if actual uncollectible accounts differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts would be required  which could have a material impact on our financial results for the period 
the allowance for sales returns is also deducted from gross accounts receivable 
from our allowance for sales returns of  as of december   we utilized  for investigation related returns  while increasing the allowance for sales returns based on our history of sales returns  resulting in the allowance for sales returns of  as of december  the total allowances deducted from gross accounts receivable as of december  is  compared to  as of december  warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve based upon our claims experience during the prior twelve months 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
as of december   accrued product warranties totaled  if actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average cost method 
our inventory consists of raw materials as well as finished goods and work in process that include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
given the nature of our substrate products  and the materials used in the manufacturing process  the wafers and ingots comprising work in process may be held in inventory for up to two years and three years  respectively  as the risk of obsolescence for these materials is low 
we routinely evaluate the levels of our inventory in light of current market conditions in order to identify excess and obsolete inventory and provide a valuation allowance for certain inventories based upon the age and quality of the product and the projections for sale of the completed products 
as of december   we had an inventory reserve of million 
if actual demand for our products were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of investments we classify our investments in debt and equity securities as available for sale securities as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all available for sale securities with a quoted market value below cost or adjusted cost are reviewed in order to determine whether the decline is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the magnitude of the decline in market value  the length of time the market value has been below cost or adjusted cost  credit quality  and our ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are classified as other assets and are accounted for under the cost method as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operations 
we monitor our investments for impairment and record reductions in carrying value when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
determination of impairment is highly subjective and is based on a number of factors  including an assessment of the strength of investee s management  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the investee  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in our carrying value 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  equipment  and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets may be impaired  we compare the carrying value of the long lived assets to the projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
in the event that the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the asset s fair value 
employee stock options we believe that employee stock options represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program 
we grant options to substantially all management employees and believe that this broad based program helps us to attract  motivate  and retain high quality employees  to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders 
we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations thereof and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r beginning january  the adoption of sfas r is expected to result in a material increase in expense during based on unvested options outstanding as of december  and current compensation plans 
while the effect of adoption depends on the level of share based payments granted in the future and unvested grants on the date we adopt sfas r  the effect of this accounting standard on our prior operating results would approximate the effect of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share 
see note the company and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for income taxes based upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region  particularly china 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws  particularly in foreign countries such as china 
results of operations overview we were founded in to commercialize and enhance our proprietary vertical gradient freeze vgf technique for producing high performance compound semiconductor substrates 
we have one operating segment our substrate business  with limited additional raw materials sales 
we recorded our first substrate sales in and our substrate division currently sells gallium arsenide gaas and indium phosphide inp substrates to manufacturers of semiconductor devices for use in applications such as fiber optic and wireless telecommunications  light emitting diodes leds and lasers 
we also sell raw materials including gallium and germanium through our participation in majority and minority owned joint ventures 
we had the capability to manufacture germanium substrates for use in satellite solar cells but withdrew from this business during so that we could more profitably use our then constrained capacity 
we are now trying to re qualify our germanium substrates with the few existing satellite solar cell system manufacturers 
continuing operations our sales of substrate products is dependant on the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical and has historically experienced downturns both as a result of economic changes and overcapacity 
in  we believed that the wireless communications and hbled markets grew  but our revenue did not increase until the fourth quarter of due to continued reductions in prices  and time required to improve our substrate surface quality and regain some lost customers 
revenue for fell by million  or compared with we recorded net losses in each quarter of during  we continued to shift more of our manufacturing operations to china and reduced our costs incurred in the united states 
in  our revenue increased million as compared to  primarily as a result of increased demand for hbleds 
in march  we learned of certain failures to comply with requirements for product testing and the provision of testing data and information relating to requirements of certain customers 
specifically  we determined that in some cases we had not provided accurate data to customers confirming that products shipped were compliant with all specifications provided by the customer  or had been manufactured at the location specified by the customer 
as a result of our conclusions  we reorganized our production and quality control procedures  established quality control and assurance as a direct reporting group to the chief executive officer  and implemented measures  including additional employee training  statistical sampling of product shipments during the quarter  and review of our satisfaction of customer specifications each quarter  to ensure adherence to operational controls 
we also implemented certain executive management changes 
as a result of the weaknesses identified  in the first quarter of we increased our sales return reserve by  based on our best estimate of future returns related to this matter 
approximately  of the  sales returns reserve had been utilized and approximately  has been reversed to revenue as of december  as we favorably resolved an outstanding matter with a customer 
this reserve was based  in part  on discussion with affected customers 
the amount of the reserve was determined in part based upon the amount of our historical product returns  payment history of prior period receivables  discussions with customers concerning the non compliant product and testing data  and estimated levels of our product maintained by customers  and likelihood that products previously shipped would be returned to us 
during the second quarter of  we announced plans to cease all production activities in the united states and to manufacture our products only in china 
in  we made a number of important changes to our management team 
philip cs yin  cs  joined the company in march as chief executive officer and restructured the organization from the top down 
in june  two new positions were created chief operating officer and chief technology officer 
also  the former president of axt s china operations became president of joint venture operations 
in september  our new vice president of global sales and marketing joined the company 
this new structure enables us to maximize the expertise and skill sets of our team while placing enhanced emphasis on manufacturing  production and quality  and quality systems improvement 
with the new management team in place  quality  quality systems and revenue began to improve beginning the third quarter of in december  we continued to execute our workforce reduction in our fremont  california facility and accordingly we will eliminate approximately positions in california over the following days 
see further discussion under restructuring charges below 
discontinued opto electronics business in june  we announced the discontinuation of our opto electronics division  which we had established as part of our acquisition of lyte optronics  inc in may the discontinued opto electronics division manufactured blue  cyan  and green high brightness light emitting diodes hbleds for the illumination markets  including full color displays  wireless handset backlighting and traffic signals  and also manufactured vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsels and laser diodes for fiber optic communications and storage area networks 
accordingly  the results of operations of the opto electronics division have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the accounting for discontinued operations 
in september  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our opto electronics business to lumei optoelectronics corp 
lumei and dalian luming science and technology group  co  ltd 
for the chinese renminbi rmb equivalent of million 
a portion of the purchase price equal to million was held in escrow to satisfy any claims that the purchasers might make for breaches of representations or warranties by us 
of this total escrow   could be released after the one year anniversary of the sale of the opto electronics business and the remainder could be released after the second anniversary of the sale 
to date  we have resolved all claims made against the million that was held in escrow 
for the year ended december  we recorded  gains from escrow   gain from interest  and  in property tax refunds 
in june  we completed the sale of a building located in monterey park  california 
this asset had been classified as assets held for sale in the amount of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we received net proceeds on the sale of the property of approximately million and accordingly recorded a gain on disposal of  impairment inventory impairment in september  we wrote down million of obsolete inventory 
the wafers and ingots comprising the written down inventory had been manufactured within the prior two and three years  respectively 
during the third quarter of  it became apparent that our revenues were likely to continue to decline in the fourth and subsequent quarters due to the need to re qualify our products with several customers 
furthermore  many new orders were for products with specifications that differed from the features of the products held in inventory 
in accordance with our policy  we evaluated the levels of our inventory  and determined that in light of current market conditions  we had excess and obsolete inventory based upon its age and quality  and that the inventory exceeded the sales projections as revised 
accordingly  we established a reserve for the excess 
the majority of this inventory has not been scrapped 
there were no significant inventory impairments for the year ended december  other impairment in the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the value of our investment in a private company 
we made the decision to write down the investment as a result of the declining financial position of the investee  evidenced by an audit opinion with a going concern explanatory paragraph received by the investee

american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   allows us to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate 
under the jobs act  we may elect  for one taxable year  an dividends received deduction for eligible dividends from our foreign subsidiaries 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the repatriated earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by our chief executive officer and approved by the company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
we are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation  should we choose to make one  on our income tax expense for fiscal  the amount of our indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings  or the amount of our deferred tax liability with respect to foreign earnings
