results of operations references to constant dollar results 
we report results in us dollars but we do business on a global basis 
exchange rate fluctuations affect the rate at which we translate foreign revenues and expenses into us dollars and have important effects on our results 
in order to illustrate these effects  the discussion of our business in this report sometimes describes the magnitude of changes in constant dollar terms 
we believe this information facilitates a comparative view of business growth

our operating margin for was  as compared to in the decrease in our operating margin is primarily due to continuing investments in new products and consulting and services capabilities  increased cost of data  and operating income declines in japan  primarily as a result of costs incurred to replace the discontinued weekly product 
recent acquisitions have also had an adverse effect on our operating margins due to the fact that some of the small businesses we have acquired have historically experienced lower operating margins than ours  and the revenue and cost synergies that we incorporate into our business plans are not all immediately realized 
we also experience higher intangible amortization in the first years after completing an acquisition and may incur additional costs in integrating the acquired operations into ours  both of which tend to increase our costs and thus decrease our operating margins in the initial years of each completed acquisition 
operating margins generally have declined over the past three years and may continue to decline in future periods as we invest in acquisitions and new products and services to drive future revenue growth

market risk our primary market risks are the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on non dollar denominated revenue  the impact of price fluctuations on equity securities and the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest expense 
we transact business in more than countries and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates 
our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
accordingly  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange movements on net income and on the value of non functional currency assets and liabilities 
it is our policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent necessary to meet our objectives as stated above 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for investment or speculative purposes

the contractual value of our hedging instruments was approximately  at december  the fair value of these hedging instruments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in foreign exchange rates 
we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values based on a hypothetical change in currency rates 
the potential loss in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments  all of which were foreign currency forward contracts  based on a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar or  in the case of non dollar related instruments  the currency being purchased  was  at december  however  the change in the fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments would likely be offset by a change in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged 
the estimated fair values of the foreign exchange risk management contracts were determined based on quoted market prices 
we also invest in equity securities and are subject to equity price risk 
these investments are classified as available for sale and consequently  carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of income taxes  reported as a component of shareholders equity

we assess our market risk based on changes in market prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values based on a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these securities 
a decline in the market price of these equity securities would cause the fair value of the securities to decrease by at december  we also borrow funds and since the interest rate associated with those borrowings changes over time  we are subject to interest rate risk 
we have not hedged all of this exposure

critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
the most significant estimates relate to allowances  work in process inventories  investments  depreciation of fixed assets including salvage values  carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  provision for income taxes and tax assets and liabilities  reserves for severance  pensions  employee benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars and shares in thousands  except per share data 
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could vary from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue as earned  which is over the service period as our products are delivered or related services are performed 
advance payments for services and subscriptions are credited to deferred revenues and reflected in operating revenue over the subscription term  which is generally one year 
revenues from post contract customer support maintenance are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement 
revenues from time and material service agreements are recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from fixed price service contracts are recognized over the contract term based on the ratio of the number of hours incurred for services provided during the period compared to the total estimated hours to be incurred over the entire arrangement 
under the terms of these contracts  all services provided by us and our subsidiaries through the date of cancellation are due and payable 
we enter into barter transactions in the normal course in which we exchange data for data  or data for other services such as advertising  software licenses and panel recruitment 
we recognize revenue from barter transactions as our products are delivered or services are performed 
the related barter expense is recognized as the products or services are utilized by us  the majority of which is in the same accounting period as the related barter revenue 
barter transactions are valued based on either the fair value of the products or services received by us or the fair value of the information or services delivered to customers  whichever is more clearly evident 
our barter revenues have accounted for approximately to of total consolidated revenues in each of the three years ended december  we expect that barter revenues will continue to account for approximately to of total consolidated revenues 
pensions and other postretirement benefits 
we provide a number of retirement benefits to our employees  including defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans 
we account for these plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively  and accordingly  the determination of benefit obligations and expense is based on actuarial models 
in order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models  critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  cash balance crediting rate  lump sum conversion rate and the assumed rate of compensation increases 
in addition  retiree medical care cost trend rates are a key assumption used exclusively in determining costs under sfas no 
management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as the turnover  retirement and mortality rates 
management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them when our experience deems it appropriate to do so 
the discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled 
for us plans  the discount rate is determined by matching the plans expected cash flow determined on a pbo basis with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade moody s aa and above non callable corporate bonds to develop the present value of the expected cash flow  and then determining the single rate discount rate which when applied to the expected cash flow derives that same present value 
in the uk specifically  the discount rate is based on the current yield of the iboxx corporate gbp aa over year bond index  which is an index of high quality corporate bonds 
for the other non us plans  the discount rate is based on the current yield of an index of high quality corporate bonds 
at december   we reduced the discount rate from to for our us pension plans and postretirement benefit plan and we reduced the discount rate for our uk pension plan from to 
the us and uk plans represent of the consolidated benefit obligation as of december  reduction in the discount rate also occurred in other non us countries  where the range of applicable discount rates at december  is versus a range of at december  these smaller non us plans constitute only of the consolidated benefit obligation at december  as a sensitivity measure  the basis point decrease in the discount rate will result in an increase in the us pension expense pre tax of approximately item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars and shares in thousands  except per share data 
under the us pension plan  participants have a notional retirement account that increases with pay and investment credits 
the rate used to determine the investment credit cash balance crediting rate varies monthly and is equal to th of the yield on year treasuries  with a minimum of 
at retirement  the account is converted to a monthly retirement benefit using a conversion rate lump sum conversion rate based on the yield on year treasuries at retirement 
the corresponding basis point decrease in the cash balance crediting and lump sum conversion rates will result in a decrease in the us pension expense pre tax of approximately in selecting an expected return on plan asset assumption  we consider the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund  the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment and long term economic forecasts for the type of investments held by the plan 
at january  the expected return on plan assets for the us pension plans is  which has been reduced from at january  outside the us the range of applicable expected rates of return is as of january   which is unchanged versus the previous year 
the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year versus this assumption 
we believe it is appropriate to use long term expected forecasts in selecting our expected return on plan assets 
as such  there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the long term expected forecasts 
the expected return on assets and the actual return on assets were  and  respectively  for the year ended december  we utilize a corridor approach to amortizing unrecognized gains and losses in our pension and postretirement plans 
amortization occurs when the accumulated unrecognized net gain or loss balance exceeds the criterion of of the larger of the beginning balances of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of the plan assets 
the excess unrecognized gain or loss balance is then amortized using the straight line method over the average remaining service life of active employees expected to receive benefits 
at december   the weighted average remaining service life of active employees was years 
at december   the fair value of assets in our pension plans exceeded the projected benefit obligation by  additional information on pension and other postretirement benefit plans is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
computer software 
direct costs incurred in the development of computer software are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
research and development costs incurred to establish technological feasibility of a computer software product are expensed in the periods in which they are incurred 
capitalization ceases and amortization starts when the product is available for general release to customers 
computer software costs are amortized on a product by product basis over three to seven years 
annual amortization is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio of current gross revenues for a product to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
we periodically review the unamortized capitalized costs of computer software products based on a comparison of the carrying value of computer software with its estimated net realizable value 
we recognize immediately any impairment losses on capitalized software as a result of our review or upon our decision to discontinue a product 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we capitalize internal use software costs in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill is no longer amortized 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually by comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units based on discounted cash flow analysis with their respective net book values 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
we completed our annual impairment test as of september  and were not required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars and shares in thousands  except per share data 
other long lived assets 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the recoverability of our long lived assets and finite lived identifiable intangibles held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in general  the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the asset 
if the future cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value 
income taxes 
we operate in more than countries around the world and our earnings are taxed at the applicable income tax rate in each of those countries 
we provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is provided 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
while we intend to continue to seek global tax planning initiatives  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and implement such initiatives to reduce or maintain our overall tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca allows companies to repatriate earnings from non us subsidiaries at a reduced us tax rate 
during the first quarter of  we made the decision to repatriate  of foreign earnings back to the us and accrued the tax associated with such remittance 
in the second quarter of  we adjusted our original estimate of the tax expense related to the repatriation primarily due to a technical correction as to the treatment of the gross up of dividends repatriated under this provision 
we completed the repatriation during the fourth quarter of and the tax provision has been adjusted to reflect the estimated tax liability associated with the repatriation 
as of december   we maintained our intention to indefinitely reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries 
deferred tax liabilities for us federal income taxes have not been recognized for these undistributed earnings 
it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes 
foreign currency translation 
we have significant investments in non us countries 
therefore  changes in the value of foreign currencies affect our consolidated financial statements when translated into us dollars 
for all operations outside the united states of america where we have designated the local currency as the functional currency  assets and liabilities are translated using end of period exchange rates  revenues  expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange 
for these countries  currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity  whereas transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income expense  net 
for operations in countries that are considered to be highly inflationary or where the us dollar is designated as the functional currency  monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using end of period exchange rates  whereas non monetary accounts are remeasured using historical exchange rates  and all remeasurement and transaction adjustments are recognized in other income expense  net 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars and shares in thousands  except per share data 
securities and other investments 
we hold investments in marketable equity securities and partnership interests in venture capital partnerships 
the equity securities are classified as available for sale and are therefore recorded at fair value in the financial statements 
unrealized gains and losses related to the available for sale securities are recorded within other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recorded in earnings in the period in which the securities are sold 
the partnership interests are recorded in the financial statements at cost 
on a quarterly basis we make estimates of the market value of these investments and reduce the carrying value of the investments if there is an other than temporary decline in the fair value below cost 
we evaluate the recoverability of the underlying securities in each partnership on an individual basis 
no investments had an estimated fair value less than the carrying value of the investment as of december  and legal costs 
legal costs in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of equity instruments 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of all employee share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method  such as the black scholes option valuation model at the date of the grant 
the resulting cost is then recognized as compensation cost in the consolidated statements of income over the service period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
in april  the securities and exchange commission deferred the effective date of sfas no 
r to the first annual reporting period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
r  however  based upon outstanding as well as future anticipated stock based award grants through december   we expect that the adoption under the modified prospective method will have approximately a fully diluted earnings per share impact on our consolidated results of operations for the year ending december  for a description of our model and assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our stock based awards  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

amends apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to eliminate the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
was effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ending december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless it would be impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
supersedes apb no 
 accounting changes  which previously required most voluntary changes in accounting principle to be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
further  under sfas no 
 if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle
