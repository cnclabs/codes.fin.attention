you should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and the results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers periods prior and subsequent to the acquisition of cag and its subsidiaries collectively cag or the predecessor 
accordingly  the discussion and analysis of historical periods prior to the acquisition do not reflect the significant impact that the acquisition of cag has had and will have on the successor  including increased leverage and liquidity requirements as well as purchase accounting adjustments 
furthermore  the successor and the predecessor have different accounting policies with respect to certain matters see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
investors are cautioned that the forward looking statements contained in this section involve both risk and uncertainty 
several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements 
many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are  therefore  beyond the control of management 
see forward looking information located at the end of this section 
the results for the nine months ended december  and the three months ended march  have not been audited  together with the results of the nine months ended december  and the three months ended march  and should not be taken as an indication of the results of operations to be reported for any subsequent period or for the full fiscal year 
reconciliation of non us gaap measures management believes that using non us gaap financial measures to supplement non us gaap results is useful to investors because such use provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business other than disclosing us gaap results alone 
in this regard  we disclose net debt  which is a non us gaap financial measure 
net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents 
management uses net debt to evaluate the capital structure 
net debt is not a substitute for any us gaap financial measure 
in addition  calculations of net debt contained in this report may not be consistent with that of other companies 
the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with us gaap in our financial statements for net debt is total debt 
for a reconciliation of net debt and total debt  see financial highlights below 
for a reconciliation of trade working capital to working capital  see selected financial data 
basis of presentation successor represents our audited consolidated financial position as of december  and and our audited consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  these consolidated financial statements reflect the application of purchase accounting  described below  relating to the original acquisition of cag and purchase price accounting adjustments relating to the acquisitions of vinamul  acetex and additional cag shares acquired during the year ended december  predecessor represents cag s audited consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december   its audited interim consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended march   and its unaudited interim consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended march  and the nine months ended december  these consolidated financial statements relate to periods prior to the acquisition of cag and present cag s historical basis of accounting without the application of purchase accounting 
the results of the successor are not comparable to the results of the predecessor due to the difference in the basis of presentation of purchase accounting as compared to historical cost 
furthermore  the successor and the predecessor have different accounting policies with respect to certain matters

as a result of the financing  our interest expense currently is  and will continue to be  substantially higher than it was prior to the acquisition 
we accounted for the initial acquisition of cag using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  this resulted in a new basis of accounting 
the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were reflected at fair value for the approximately portion acquired and at cag historical basis for the remaining approximate 
the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired at closing was allocated to goodwill  and this indefinite lived asset is subject to an annual impairment review 
during the three months ended march   we finalized the purchase accounting adjustments for the original acquisition of cag see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we decreased goodwill by million as a result of purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition and the acquisition of additional cag shares

additionally  the amended and restated senior credit facilities included a million delayed draw term loan  which expired unutilized in july on april   we used the remaining proceeds of the initial public offering and concurrent financings to pay a special cash dividend  declared on march   to holders of our series b common stock of million

we also paid to such shareholders million million in consideration for the settlement of certain claims and for such shareholders agreeing to  among other things  accept the shareholders resolutions passed at the extraordinary general meeting of cag held on july and  and the annual general meeting of cag held on may and   acknowledge the legal effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement  irrevocably withdraw and abandon all actions  applications and appeals each brought or joined in legal proceedings related to  among other things  challenging the effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement and amount of fair cash compensation offered by the purchaser in the mandatory offer required by section of the german stock corporation act  refrain from acquiring any cag shares or any other investment in cag  and refrain from taking any future legal action with respect to shareholder resolutions or corporate actions of cag

the mandatory offer will remain open for two months following final resolution of the award proceedings spruchverfahren by the german courts 
as of december  and  our ownership interest in cag was approximately and  respectively 
on november   our board of directors approved commencement of the process for effecting a squeeze out of the remaining shareholders  as defined below 
squeeze out because we own shares representing more than of the registered ordinary share capital excluding treasury shares of cag  we have decided to exercise our right  as permitted under german law  to the transfer of the shares owned by the outstanding minority shareholders of cag in exchange for fair cash compensation the squeeze out 
the squeeze out will require the approval by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at cag s annual general meeting in may and will become effective upon its registration in the commercial register 
if we are successful in effecting the squeeze out  we must pay the then remaining minority shareholders of cag fair cash compensation  in exchange for their shares 
the amount of the fair cash compensation per share has been set at 
the amount to be paid to the minority shareholders as fair cash compensation in exchange for their cag shares in connection with the squeeze out was determined on the basis of the fair value of cag  determined by us in accordance with applicable german legal requirements  as of the date of the applicable resolution of cag s shareholders meeting  and examined by a duly qualified auditor chosen and appointed by the frankfurt district court landgericht 
the squeeze out will require approval by the shareholders of cag 
while it is expected that we will have the requisite majority in such meeting to assure approval of such measures  minority shareholders  irrespective of the size of their shareholding  may  within one month from the date of any such shareholder resolution  file an action with the court to have such resolution set aside 
while such action would only be successful if the resolution were passed in violation of applicable laws and cannot be based on the unfairness of the amount to be paid to the minority shareholders  a shareholder action may substantially delay the implementation of the challenged shareholder resolution pending final resolution of the action 
if such action proved to be successful  the action could prevent the implementation of the squeeze out 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the squeeze out can be implemented timely or at all

overview nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december  net sales in the nine months ended december  increased to  million compared to the same period in the improvement is primarily due to an increase in net sales from the vinamul and acetex businesses and higher pricing  mainly in chemical products  offset by slightly lower volumes 
net sales from vinamul and acetex were approximately million and million  respectively 
our performance improved over as increased pricing and cost savings initiatives more than offset higher raw material and energy costs 
as a result  our operating profit margin increased to for the nine months ended december  from in the same period in for the nine months ended december   vinamul and acetex including at plastics  had operating losses of million and million  respectively  primarily related to integration costs in connection with the acquisitions and inventory purchase accounting adjustments for acetex 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests for the nine months ended december  increased to million compared to a net loss of million in the same period in this increase is primarily due to higher operating profit  lower interest expense and higher dividend income 
interest expense in included the expensing of deferred financing costs of million and a prepayment premium of million associated with the refinancing of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
this increase was partially offset by a million increase in in interest expense due to higher debt levels and higher interest rates 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests for the nine months ended december  includes an million net loss on disposition of assets compared to a million net gain on disposition of assets in the same period in the net earnings for the nine months ended december  includes a million loss on the disposal of ticona s coc business  offset by a million gain on the disposition of two acetate products properties and million in other gains  net 
net earnings loss for the nine months ended december  improved to net earnings of million compared to a net loss of million for the same period in net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents rose to  million at december  from  million at december   primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
we largely used available cash to finance the vinamul and acetex acquisitions  the redemption of acetex senior notes and the purchase of the additional cag shares from two minority shareholders 
in september  we announced a controlled shutdown of our plants in clear lake  pasadena  bay city and bishop  texas in preparation for hurricane rita 
we subsequently announced that these plants sustained minimal damage from this hurricane and production resumed at these plants in october we believe the hurricane had an aggregate negative impact on earnings of approximately million during the nine months ended december  overview three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  in the three months ended march   net sales rose to  million compared to  million  in the same period in  primarily due to higher pricing  higher volumes  favorable currency movements and product composition changes  of which million was related to the vinamul acquisition 
net earnings loss declined to a net loss of million compared to net earnings of million in the same period in largely due to higher interest expense  which included million in debt refinancing related costs comprised of early redemption premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of million and million  respectively  and higher special charges  mainly due to million in expenses for the termination of sponsor monitoring services 
the three months ended march  benefited from higher pricing mainly in chemical products  driven by strong demand and higher industry capacity utilization 
we also benefited from cost savings resulting from restructuring and productivity improvement programs as well as lower depreciation and amortization 
these benefits were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs 
overview nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december  all business segments experienced volume growth in the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the chemical products segment benefited from stronger overall demand  while the ticona segment grew on new commercial applications and stronger demand from the automotive  electrical electronics  household goods  and medical markets 
the performance of ticona s affiliates also reflected improved business conditions 
the overall economic environment  however  remained challenging due to higher raw material and energy costs  as well as weaker pricing for some products in the ticona and performance products segments compared to the same period in net sales in the nine months ended december  rose to  million compared to net sales for the same period in mainly on higher volumes in all business segments  stronger pricing in chemical products and favorable currency effects  which were partially offset by lower pricing in the remaining segments and changes in the composition of the chemical products segment 
operating profit increased to million from million in the same period in operating profit benefited from increased net sales  lower stock appreciation rights expense of million as well as cost savings 
these factors were partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs  higher special charges of million  expenses associated with a new management compensation plan of million  and higher professional and consulting fees 
for the nine months ended december   operating profit included lower depreciation and amortization of million resulting primarily from purchase accounting adjustments and a non cash charge of million in inventory related purchase accounting adjustments 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to a loss of million from earnings of million in the same period in mainly due to an increase in interest expense of million  resulting from the higher debt levels and the expensing of deferred financing costs of million  and the absence of million in income from the demutualization of an insurance provider  which was partially offset by higher operating profit of million 
net earnings loss decreased to a loss of million compared to earnings of million for the same period a year earlier 
net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents rose to  million from million as of december   primarily to finance the acquisition of cag and to prefund benefit obligations 
overview three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  in the three months ended march   all of the predecesor s businesses experienced strong volume growth compared to the same period the previous year and benefited from increased activity in some of its markets  such as electrical electronics  new applications for technical polymers and food ingredients  and tight supply conditions in the acetyl products markets 
operating profit declined  however  due to higher raw material and energy costs  special charges and the absence of income from stock appreciation rights  which were partially offset by favorable currency effects 
net sales increased to  million due to volume increases and favorable currency effects  resulting mainly from the stronger euro versus the us dollar 
volume increases were particularly strong in the acetate products and ticona segments 
these factors were partially offset by the effects of transfer of the european oxo business to a venture in the fourth quarter of earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests were million compared to million in the comparable period in net earnings loss increased to million from million in the same period in selected data by business segment nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december  and three months ended march  compared with three months ended march

nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december chemical products net sales increased to  million for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of net sales from vinamul and acetex excluding at plastics during of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  pricing increased for most products  but primarily from acetic acid  vinyl acetate monomer and acetyl derivatives 
the price increase was driven by continued strong demand  high industry utilization in base products and higher raw material costs  particularly for ethylene and natural gas 
overall  volumes declined primarily from acetyl derivatives partially offset by significantly improved volumes from vinyl acetate monomer 
volumes for emulsions was flat 
the increase in volumes from vinyl acetate monomer is primarily driven by continued strong demand 
special charges increased by million for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in included in is million in charges for a change in the environmental remediation strategy related to the closure of the edmonton methanol plant and million for severance charges related to the same closure 
operating profit increased to million for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the increase is principally driven by higher pricing  which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs 
the segment also benefited from a full quarter impact of its southern chemical methanol supply contract 
basic products  such as acetic acid and vinyl acetate monomer  had greater success in maintaining margins while downstream products  such as polyvinyl alcohol and emulsions  continued to experience margin compression due to raw material costs rising faster than our pricing 
operating profit was also favorably impacted in this period due to million from the settlement of transportation related anti trust matters  million in lower non cash inventory related purchase accounting adjustments and acetex excluding at plastics recording an operating profit of million in the nine months ended december  the increase in operating profit was partially offset by vinamul recording operating losses of million  which included integration costs in connection with the acquisition 
additionally  depreciation and amortization increased in compared to the same period in primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments in both years 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million compared to the same period in benefiting from increased operating profit and dividends from our saudi cost investment 
three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  chemical products net sales increased to  million compared to the same period last year mainly on higher pricing  segment composition changes  of which million was related to vinamul  and favorable currency effects 
pricing increased for most products  driven by continued strong demand and high utilization rates across the chemical industry 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million from million in the same period in as higher pricing was partially offset by higher raw material costs 
earnings also benefited from an increase of million in dividends from our saudi cost investment  which totaled million in the quarter 
the three months ended march  included million in earnings from vinamul  which included million in non cash inventory related purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs in connection with the acquisition

nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december ticona s net sales increased to million for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the increase is primarily driven by the successful implementation of price increases  introduction of new applications and increased penetration into key markets 
this increase is partially offset by lower overall volumes and slightly unfavorable currency effects 
improved volumes from most of ticona s product lines were more than offset by a decline in polyacetal volumes attributable to a weak european automotive market and reduced sales to lower end applications 
ticona recorded income from special charges of million for the nine months ended december  compared to expense of million for the same period in included in is approximately million associated with plumbing insurance recoveries  which was partially offset by an additional million non cash impairment charge associated with the planned disposal of the coc business 
the million in is primarily related to a non cash impairment charge from the coc business 
operating profit increased to million for the nine months ended december  compared to an operating loss of million for the same period in the successful implementation of price increases helped to offset higher raw material and energy costs 
also contributing to the increase are productivity improvements  cost savings from an organizational redesign and lower depreciation and amortization expenses due to changes in the useful lives of certain property  plant and equipment 
in addition  included a million charge to cost of sales for a non cash inventory related purchase accounting adjustment 
operating profit in the nine months ended december  includes approximately million for the loss on disposal of the coc business compared to an impairment charge of million taken in earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million for the nine months ended december  compared to million in the same period in this increase is primarily due to the increase in operating profit  improved equity earnings from asian and us affiliates due to increased sales volumes  a million reduction in special charges  and the absence of a purchase accounting adjustment of million in three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  net sales for ticona increased by to million compared to the same period last year due to favorable currency effects and slightly higher volumes 
volumes increased for most product lines due to the successful introduction of new applications  which outweighed declines in polyacetal volumes resulting from our focus on high end business and decreased sales to european automotive customers 
overall pricing remained flat over the same periods as successfully implemented price increases were offset by lower average pricing for certain products due to the commercialization of lower cost grades for new applications 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million as the result of restructuring cost savings  the favorable effects of a planned maintenance turnaround and slightly higher volumes 
these increases were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs

nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december acetate products net sales for the nine months ended december  increased to million compared to the same period in the improvement is due to a increase in pricing and a increase in overall volumes 
higher flake volumes from increased sales to our recently expanded china tow ventures were partially offset by lower tow volumes due to the shutdown of our edmonton  canada tow plant 
price increases partially offset higher raw material and energy costs 
for the nine months ended december   the acetate products segment recorded special charges of million compared to million in the same period in special charges gains in primarily related to a change in the environmental remediation strategy related to the closure of the edmonton methanol plant  while special charges gains in the same period in primarily represented asset impairments associated with the planned consolidation of tow and flake production 
operating profit increased to million in the nine months ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the same period in the increase is largely due to the decrease in special charges gains described above and a million gain on the sale of the rock hill  sc plant and the charlotte  nc research and development center 
in addition  depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily resulting from a lower depreciable assets base due to previous asset impairments and an million charge for asset retirement obligations recorded in associated with the restructuring of the business 
higher pricing and savings from restructuring and productivity improvements more than offset increased raw material and energy costs  as well as temporarily higher manufacturing costs resulting from a realignment of inventory levels as part of the restructuring strategy 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million for the nine months ended december  compared to a million loss from continuing operations in the same period in this increase is primarily due to the increase in operating profit which included million in lower special charges and the million gain on disposition of assets 
three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  net sales for acetate products increased by to million compared to the same quarter last year on higher volumes and pricing 
flake volumes increased due to higher sales to our recently expanded china tow ventures 
pricing increased to partially offset higher raw material and energy costs 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests more than doubled from million in first quarter last year to million this year due to increased volumes  pricing and productivity improvements  which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs 
earnings also benefited from million in lower depreciation and amortization expense largely as a result of previous restructuring impairments  which was partly offset by million of expense for an asset retirement obligation

nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december chemical products net sales increased by to  million for the nine months ended december  from the comparable period last year as higher selling prices  increased volumes and favorable currency movements were partially offset by changes in the composition of the segment 
pricing increased for most products  particularly vinyl acetate monomer  acetic acid  and acetyl derivative products  driven by high industry utilization and higher costs for raw materials 
volumes also increased  particularly for vinyl acetate monomer  polyvinyl alcohol and emulsions due to strong overall demand 
the changes in the composition of the segment result from the transfer of the european oxo business to a venture in the fourth quarter of and a change in the structure of the business under which certain acrylates products  which were formerly sold into the merchant market  are now being sold under a contract manufacturing agreement 
only the margin realized under such contract manufacturing arrangement is now reported in net sales 
operating profit increased to million for the nine months ended december  from million in the same period last year 
higher pricing  higher volumes  as well as favorable currency effects  were partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs 
operating profit was also favorably impacted by lower stock appreciation rights expense of million and the absence of a million loss from the european oxo business  as well as a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of million  largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments 
operating profit in the nine months ended december  included a million non cash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million compared to million for the nine months ended december  as a result of higher operating profit which included one time adjustments such as the significant decline in stock appreciation rights expense and the absence of purchase accounting adjustments in this was partially offset by lower dividend income from cost investments and lower equity in net earnings of affiliates due to restructuring charges in the european oxo venture 
three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  chemical products net sales increased by to million in the three months ended march  from the comparable period last year as increased volumes  favorable currency movements and higher selling prices were partially offset by the effects of the transfer of the european oxo business into a venture as well as a change in the structure of the business under which certain acrylates products  which were formerly sold into the merchant market  are now being sold under a contract manufacturing agreement 
only the margin realized under such contract manufacturing arrangement is now reported in net sales 
volumes and pricing for most acetyl products  particularly vinyl acetate monomer  increased in most regions  due to a temporary competitor outage and stronger overall demand 
operating profit increased to million in the three months ended march  from million in the same period last year 
higher volumes and selling prices  as well as favorable currency effects  were partially offset by increased raw material costs and spending associated with productivity initiatives  increased energy costs  the transfer of the european oxo business  and the absence of income from stock appreciation rights of million 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million compared to million in the three months ended march  primarily due to a higher operating profit partially offset by lower dividend income from cost investments and our share of the loss generated by our european oxo venture

nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december net sales for ticona increased by to million for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period last year 
strong volume increases and favorable currency effects were partly offset by a decline in pricing 
volumes grew in all product lines  particularly in core products 
polyacetal volumes grew on stronger sales in the automotive and medical industries in north america while european sales benefited from greater demand for uses in consumer products and the commercialization of new applications 
volumes for vectra liquid crystal polymers rose in north america and europe due to new commercial applications  such as household goods  and stronger sales to the electrical electronics industry 
gur ultra high molecular weight polyethylene grew as a result of increased sales for new specialty applications and stronger sales to asia 
overall pricing declined due to changes in product mix and ongoing competitive pressure from asian exports of polyacetal into north america and europe 
ticona recorded special charges of million for the nine months ended december  compared to income from special charges of million for the same period last year 
the special charges in are mainly related to a million non cash impairment charge associated with a plan to dispose of the coc business 
income from special charges in consisted of insurance recoveries related to the plumbing cases of million  which were partially offset by million in organizational redesign costs 
operating profit decreased to a loss of million for the nine months ended december  from an operating profit of million for the same period last year principally due to the impact of changes in special charges mentioned above 
results for the nine months ended december  benefited from higher volumes  lower stock appreciation rights expense of million and productivity improvements 
these factors were partly offset by higher raw material and energy costs 
operating profit in the nine months ended december  included a million non cash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting  which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests decreased to million for the nine months ended december  from million for the same period in this decrease resulted primarily from the changes in operating profit and lower interest income related to insurance recoveries  which was partly offset by improved equity earnings from asian and us affiliates due to increased sales volumes 
three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  net sales for ticona increased by to million for the three months ended march  compared to the same period last year as higher volumes and favorable currency movements was partially offset by lower selling prices 
volumes increased in most business lines  particularly in polyacetal and vectra liquid crystal polymers 
polyacetal volumes grew in north america and europe on sales to new end uses and higher sales to the north american automotive market 
volumes for vectra rose due to new commercial applications in north america and europe and stronger sales to the electrical electronics industry 
pricing declined as lower priced products constituted a higher percentage of sales and competitive pressure continued from asian imports of polyacetal into north america 
operating profit increased to million versus million in the same period last year due to higher volumes  lower average production costs for vectra  reduced spending partly resulting from the closure of the telford  uk production facility in and favorable currency movements 
these increases were partially offset by lower pricing as well as the absence of million of income from stock appreciation rights 
earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million compared to million in the same period in this increase resulted from the higher operating profit and improved equity earnings from our polyplastics and fortron industries affiliates due to increased sales volumes

volumes grew on higher tow demand in asia 
operating loss increased to a loss of million in the nine months ended december  from a loss of million in the same period last year reflecting special charges of million for non cash asset impairments associated with the planned consolidation of tow production  as well as higher raw material costs 
these decreases were partly offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense of million  largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments  and a lower depreciable asset base  as well as from productivity gains 
operating loss in the nine months ended december  included a million non cash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting  which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold 
three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  acetate products net sales in the first three months ended march  increased by to million compared to the same period in primarily due to higher volumes 
average pricing remained unchanged 
volumes grew on higher sales of tow  particularly in china 
operating profit and earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests rose to million compared to million in the same period last year on higher volumes of tow as well as productivity gains

nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december net sales for the performance products segment  which consists of the nutrinova food ingredients and sorbates businesses  increased by to million compared to the same period last year as increased volumes and favorable currency effects were principally offset by price decreases 
increased volumes for sunett sweetener reflected strong growth from new and existing applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets 
consistent with our strategy  pricing for sunett declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers and the anticipated expiration of the primary european and us production patents at the end of march pricing for sorbates  which had been under pressure from asian producers  began to stabilize  although worldwide overcapacity still prevailed in the industry 
operating profit increased to million compared to loss of million in the same period last year  which included special charges gains of million related to antitrust matters in the sorbates industry 
operating profit in the nine months ended december  included a million non cash charge for the manufacturing profit added to inventory under purchase accounting  which was charged to cost of sales as the inventory was sold  and higher depreciation and amortization expense of million largely as a result of purchase accounting adjustments 
three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  net sales for the performance products segment increased by to million primarily due to increased volumes 
pricing for sunett sweetener declined on lower unit selling prices associated with higher volumes to major customers  an overall price decline in the high intensity sweetener market  and the anticipated expiration of the european and us production patents at the end of march increased sunett volumes reflected strong growth from new and existing applications in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets 
in sorbates  pricing and volume pressure from asian producers continued due to worldwide overcapacity 
operating profit and earnings from continuing operations before tax and minority interests declined to million compared to million in the same period last year  primarily due to lower pricing 
higher sunett volumes and currency movements partly offset this decline 
other activities other activities primarily consists of corporate center costs  including financing and certain administrative activities  and certain other operating entities  including the captive insurance companies 
nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december net sales for other activities increased by to million for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period last year 
this increase primarily reflects higher third party revenues by the captive insurance companies 
the operating loss of other activities increased to million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase was primarily due to million in new management incentive compensation expenses  which includes charges related to a new a deferred compensation plan  a new stock incentive plan and other executive bonuses  as well as higher consulting and professional fees  which includes the advisor monitoring fees of million 
the operating loss for the nine months ended december  included income resulting from the reversal of environmental reserves of million  which was offset by expense associated with stock appreciation rights of million 
loss from continuing operations before tax and minority interests increased to million from a loss of million for the same period last year 
this was largely due to million of higher interest expense due to increased debt levels  an million charge for the refinancing of debt  a higher operating loss and the absence of income from the demutualization of an insurance provider of million 
three months ended march  compared with three months ended march  net sales for other activities remained flat at million for the three months ended march  compared to the same period last year 
the operating loss of other activities increased to million for the three months ended march  compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase was primarily due to special charges of million mainly related to advisory services associated with the acquisition of cag 
also contributing to this decline was the absence of income from stock appreciation rights of million 
summary of consolidated results nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december  net sales net sales increased to  million in the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the improvement is primarily due to an increase in net sales from the vinamul and acetex acquisitions and higher pricing  mainly in the chemical products segment 
net sales from vinamul and acetex including at plastics were approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
these increases are partially offset by a decline in volumes primarily from the chemical products acetyl derivatives business line and a decline in ticona s polyacetal volumes  partially offset by improved volumes from acetate products and performance products 
for chemical products  this is primarily due to weaker european market conditions 
the decline for ticona is due to a weak european automotive market and reduced sales to lower end applications 
acetate products volumes improved due to higher flake sales to our recently expanded china tow ventures  which were partially offset by lower tow volumes due to the shutdown of the canadian tow plant 
volumes from performance products improved primarily for the sunett sweetener and sorbates due to continued growth from new and existing applications mainly in the us and european beverage and confectionary markets 
cost of sales cost of sales increased by million to  million for the nine months ended december  versus the same period in the increase is primarily due to including million and million cost of sales from vinamul and acetex including at plastics  respectively 
the increase is also due to higher raw material and energy costs  mainly from natural gas and ethylene 
cost of sales was favorably impacted by a million settlement of transportation related antitrust matters in december and million in lower non cash inventory related purchase accounting adjustments 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales was in compared to in excluding the million settlement and purchase accounting adjustments  cost of sales would have been in compared to in the increase is primarily due to higher raw material and energy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in the nine months ended december compared to the same period in this decrease is due to ongoing cost savings initiatives  organizational redesign of the ticona and acetate products segments  and decreases in legal  audit and general expenses associated with the acquisition of cag and the ipo 
in addition  included approximately million in new management incentive compensation expenses  which includes charges for a new deferred compensation plan  a new stock incentive plan and other executive bonuses 
these decreases are partially offset by the addition of costs associated with vinamul and acetex of million and million  respectively  which included integration costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions 
special charges gains special charges gains include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations 
restructuring provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign the business operations  as well as costs incurred in connection with decisions to exit non strategic businesses 
these measures are based on formal management decisions  establishment of agreements with employees representatives or individual agreements with affected employees  as well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan 
the related reserves reflect certain estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under existing restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience may be different from these estimates 
the components of special charges gains for the nine months ended december  and were as follows

special charges decreased to million compared to million for the same period last year 
the nine months ended december  primarily relates to charges for a change in the environmental remediation strategy related to the closure of the edmonton methanol plant  severance associated with the same closure  severance related to the relocation of corporate offices and asset impairments associated with the planned disposal of the coc business of million  million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  includes million associated with plumbing insurance recoveries 
special charges for the nine months ended december  of million were largely related to restructing charges of million resulting from plans by the acetate products segment to consolidate tow production at fewer sites and to discontinue production of acetate filament and million related to a decision to dispose of the ticona coc business 
operating profit operating profit increased to million in the nine months ended december  compared to million in the same period in  principally driven by higher pricing and productivity improvements resulting in a million increase in the gross profit margin  million of lower selling  general and administrative expenses and million of lower special charges 
partially offsetting the increase is an million loss on disposition of assets compared to a million gain recorded in the same period in and higher raw material and energy costs  mainly for ethylene and natural gas in included in is a million gain on the disposition of two acetate products properties  a million gain on the sale of performance products omega dha business  offset by a million loss on the disposal of ticona s coc business and million of other losses 
for the nine months ended december   vinamul and acetex including at plastics  had operating losses of million and million  respectively  primarily related to integration costs in connection with the acquisitions and inventory purchase accounting adjustments for acetex 
equity in net earnings of affiliates equity in net earnings of affiliates increased by million to million for the nine months ended december  the increase is primarily due to restructuring charges in our european oxo venture in during the nine months ended december   we received cash distributions from our equity affiliates of million compared to million in the same period in interest expense interest expense decreased million to million for the nine months ended december  compared to million in the same period in the decrease in interest expense is due to expensing deferred financing costs of million and a prepayment premium of million associated with the refinancing of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense due to higher debt levels and interest rates in other income expense  net other income expense  net increased to income of million for the nine months ended december   compared to expense of million for the comparable period last year 
this increase is largely due to million in higher dividend income in primarily from our saudi cost investment due to higher methanol pricing 
in addition  million of the increase is related to favorable exchange rate movements and million is due to favorable changes in cross currency swap valuations in income taxes income taxes for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  are recorded based on the annual effective tax rate 
for the year ending december   the annual effective tax rate is  which is less than the combination of the federal statutory rate and blended state income tax rates in the us the annual effective tax rate for reflects earnings in low tax jurisdictions  a valuation allowance on the tax benefit associated with us and other foreign losses which includes expenses associated with the early redemption of debt  tax expense in certain non us jurisdictions and reversal of a million valuation allowance on certain german deferred tax assets  primarily net of operating loss carryforwards  principally as a result of a tax sharing agreement 
for the nine months ended december   we recorded tax expense of million 
for the nine months ended december   we recorded tax expense of million and the effective tax rate was negative 
the effective tax rate in was unfavorably affected primarily by the application of full valuation allowances against post acquisition net us deferred tax assets  canadian deferred tax assets due to post acquisition restructuring  certain german deferred tax assets and the non recognition of tax benefits associated with acquisition related expenses 
these unfavorable effects were partially offset by unrepatriated low taxed earnings primarily in singapore 
earnings loss from discontinued operations in october  we announced plans to implement a strategic restructuring of our acetate business to increase efficiency  reduce overcapacity in certain areas and to focus on products and markets that provide long term value 
as part of this restructuring we consolidated our acetate flake and tow operations at three locations  instead of five and in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued acetate products filament operations 
as a result  the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses related to the filament business line are reflected as a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for details regarding the discontinued operations of chemical products and ticona  see the discussion in summary of consolidated results nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december  under the earnings loss from discontinued operations caption

other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased to million of income for the three months ended march   compared to million for the comparable period last year 
this decrease is primarily due to expenses associated with the anticipated guaranteed payment to cag minority shareholders and the ineffective portion of a net investment hedge

special charges for the nine months ended december  of million were largely related to non cash impairment charges of million and million resulting from plans by the acetate products segment to consolidate tow production at fewer sites and to discontinue production of acetate filament and a decision to dispose of the ticona coc business  respectively 
special charges for the nine months ended december  of million resulted mainly from expenses of million associated with antitrust matters in the sorbates industry and employee termination benefits of million  which were largely offset by income of million from insurance recoveries 
operating profit operating profit for the nine months ended december  increased to million from million in the same period last year 
operating profit benefited from increased net sales and million of lower expense for stock appreciation rights and lower depreciation and amortization expense of million  which were partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs  higher special charges  new management compensation expense of million  inventory purchase accounting adjustments of million  and higher professional and consulting fees 
equity in net earnings of affiliates equity in net earnings of affiliates rose by million to million in the nine months ended december  compared to the same period last year 
this increase primarily represents improved equity earnings from asian and us affiliates due to increased sales volumes  partially offset by lower earnings due to restructuring charges in the european oxo venture 
cash distributions received from equity affiliates were million in the nine months ended december  compared to million in the same period of interest expense interest expense increased to million for the nine months ended december  from million in the same period last year 
the higher interest expense resulted from increased debt levels of  million as of december  versus million as of december   resulting from the acquisition of cag as well as the expensing of deferred financing costs of million from the refinancing of the senior subordinated bridge loan facilities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
interest income for the nine months ended december   interest income decreased by million to million compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to significantly lower interest income associated with insurance recoveries 
other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased by million to an expense of million compared to the same period last year 
this decrease is primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange effects on cash and cash equivalents and the absence of million in income from the demutualization of an insurance provider  as well as unfavorable changes in swap valuations 
dividend income from investments in the nine months ended december  accounted for under the cost method decreased to million compared to million in the same period in the prior year due to the timing of receipt of dividends 
income taxes income tax expense increased by million to million for the nine months ended december  and the effective tax rate for this period was negative 
the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected primarily by the application of full valuation allowances against post acquisition net us deferred tax assets  canadian deferred tax assets due to post acquisition restructurings  certain german deferred tax assets and the non recognition of tax benefits associated with acquisition related expenses 
these unfavorable effects were partially offset by unrepatriated low taxed earnings primarily in singapore 
for the same period in  income tax expense of million was recorded based on a annual effective tax rate of 
minority interests for the nine months ended december   minority interests increased to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
this increase primarily relates to the minority interests in the earnings of cag 
earnings loss from discontinued operations in october  we announced plans to implement a strategic restructuring of our acetate business to increase efficiency  reduce overcapacity in certain areas and to focus on products and markets that provide long term value 
as part of this restructuring  we planned to discontinue acetate filament production before the end of and to consolidate our acetate flake and tow operations at three locations  instead of five 
in september  cag and dow reached an agreement for dow to purchase the acrylates business of cag 
this transaction was completed in february and the sales price was million  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
dow acquired cag s acrylates business line  including inventory  intellectual property and technology for crude acrylic acid  glacial acrylic acid  ethyl acrylate  butyl acrylate  methyl acrylate and ethylhexyl acrylate  as well as acrylates production assets at the clear lake  texas facility 
in related agreements we will provide certain contract manufacturing services to dow  and dow will supply to us acrylates for use in our emulsions production 
the acrylates business was part of chemical products 
as a result the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses related to the acrylates product lines at the clear lake  texas facility are reflected as a component of discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no

these outflows were partially offset by a decline in payments associated with bonuses and income taxes  as well as lower cash consumed through changes in trade receivables and trade payables 
the hedging of foreign currency net receivables  primarily intercompany  resulted in million cash inflow in compared to million inflow in net cash used in investing activities net cash from investing activities improved to a cash outflow of million in compared to a cash outflow of  million in the cash outflow in primarily resulted from the cag acquisition 
the cash outflow included the acquisitions of the vinamul and acetex businesses  the acquisition of additional cag shares and a decrease in net proceeds from disposal of discontinued operations of million 
the net proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations represents cash received in from an early contractual settlement of receivables of million related to the sale of vinnolit kunstoff gmbh and vintron gmbh 
the net proceeds of million in the same period last year represented the net proceeds from the sale of the acrylates business 
net cash from investing activities decreased to a cash outflow of  million in compared to a cash outflow of million in the increased cash outflow primarily resulted from the acquisition of cag

historically  the primary liquidity requirements were for capital expenditures  working capital  pension contributions and investments 
our contractual obligations  commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant and are substantially higher than historical amounts 
our primary source of liquidity will continue to be cash generated from operations as well as existing cash on hand 
we have availability under our amended and restated credit facilities to assist  if required  in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations 
we believe we will have available resources to meet both our short term and long term liquidity requirements  including debt service 
if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations  we may be forced to use other means available to us such as to increase our borrowings under our lines of credit  reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
in january  we completed an initial public offering of series a common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts and offering expenses of million 
concurrently  we received net proceeds of million from the offering of its convertible preferred stock and borrowed an additional  million under the amended and restated senior credit facilities 
a portion of the proceeds of the share offerings were used to redeem million of senior discount notes and million of senior subordinated notes  which excludes early redemption premiums of million and million  respectively 
we also used a portion of the proceeds from additional borrowings under our senior credit facilities to repay our million floating rate term loan  which excludes a million early redemption premium and used million of the proceeds as the primary financing for the acquisition of the vinamul emulsion business 
on april   we used the remaining proceeds to pay a special cash dividend to holders of our series b common stock of million 
upon payment of the million dividend  all of the shares of celanese series b common stock converted automatically to shares of celanese series a common stock 
in addition  we may use the available sources of liquidity to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of cag

as of december   we paid million in aggregate dividends on our series a common stock 
based upon the number of outstanding shares as of december   the anticipated annual cash dividend payment is approximately million 
however  there is no assurance that sufficient cash or surplus will be available to pay such dividend 
as of december   we had total debt of  million and cash and cash equivalents of million 
net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents increased to  million from  million as of december  primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
we largely used available cash to finance the acetex acquisition  the redemption of acetex senior notes and the purchase of the additional cag shares from two minority shareholders 
during the nine months ended december   million was contributed to the pension plans

on a stand alone basis  celanese corporation and crystal us holdings llc crystal llc  the issuer of the senior discount notes  have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries  and no independent external operations of their own apart from the financing

domination agreement 
at the cag annual shareholders meeting on june   cag shareholders approved payment of a dividend on the cag shares for the fiscal year ended december  of per share 
for the nine month fiscal year ended on september   cag was not able to pay a dividend to its shareholders due to losses incurred in the cag statutory accounts 
accordingly  in the near term  celanese corporation  crystal llc and bcp crystal us holdings corp bcp crystal  which issued the senior subordinated notes and term loans  will use existing cash and borrowings from their subsidiaries  subject to various restrictions  including restrictions imposed by the senior credit facilities and indentures and by relevant provisions of german and other applicable laws  to make interest payments 
if the domination agreement ceases to be operative  the ability of celanese corporation and bcp crystal to meet their obligations will be materially and adversely affected 
the domination agreement was approved at the cag extraordinary shareholders meeting on july  the domination agreement between cag and the purchaser became effective on october  when the domination agreement became effective  the purchaser was obligated to offer to acquire all outstanding cag shares from the minority shareholders of cag in return for payment of fair cash compensation 
this offer will continue until two months following the date on which the decision on the last motion in award proceedings spruchverfahren as described in legal proceedings shareholder litigation  has been disposed of and has been published 
these award proceedings were dismissed in  however  the dismissal is still subject to appeal 
the amount of this fair cash compensation has been determined to be per share  plus interest  in accordance with applicable german law 
any minority shareholder who elects not to sell their shares to the purchaser will be entitled to remain a shareholder of cag and to receive from the purchaser a gross guaranteed fixed annual payment on their shares of per cag share less certain corporate taxes in lieu of any future dividend 
taking into account the circumstances and the tax rates at the time of entering into the domination agreement  the net guaranteed fixed annual payment is per share for a full fiscal year 
based upon the number of cag shares held by the minority shareholders as of december   a net guaranteed fixed annual payment of million is expected in in addition  pursuant to the settlement agreement entered into on march  with eleven minority shareholders who had filed lawsuits in the frankfurt district court landgericht  the fixed annual payment for the fiscal year will also be paid on this date 
this will amount to an additional net aggregate amount of approximately million 
the net guaranteed fixed annual payment may  depending on applicable corporate tax rates  in the future be higher  lower or the same as 
on march   the purchaser set the cash compensation in relation to the transfer of shares held by the minority shareholders at per share 
the total amount of funds necessary to purchase such outstanding shares under the current offer of per share is approximately million 
the company is currently evaluating the financial impact of this offer on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows  but does not believe that the impact will be material 
while the domination agreement is operative  the purchaser is required to compensate cag for any statutory annual loss incurred by cag  the dominated entity at the end of its fiscal year when the loss was incurred 
if the purchaser were obligated to make cash payments to cag to cover an annual loss  the purchaser may not have sufficient funds to pay interest when due and  unless the purchaser is able to obtain funds from a source other than annual profits of cag  the purchaser may not be able to satisfy its obligation to fund such shortfall 
the domination agreement cannot be terminated by the purchaser in the ordinary course until september  our subsidiaries  bcp caylux holdings luxembourg sca and bcp crystal  have each agreed to provide the purchaser with financing to strengthen the purchaser s ability to fulfill its obligations under  or in connection with  the domination agreement and to ensure that the purchaser will perform all of its obligations under  or in connection with  the domination agreement when such obligations become due  including  without limitation  the obligations to make a guaranteed fixed annual payment to the outstanding minority shareholders  to offer to acquire all outstanding cag shares from the minority shareholders in return for payment of fair cash consideration and to compensate cag for any statutory annual loss incurred by cag during the term of the domination agreement 
if bcp caylux and or bcp crystal are obligated to make payments under such guarantees or other security to the purchaser and or the minority shareholders  we may not have sufficient funds for payments on our indebtedness when due 
in the first quarter of  we paid million to affiliates of the blackstone group related to an advisor monitoring agreement 
this agreement was terminated concurrent with the initial public offering and resulted in an additional million payment

environmental matters for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december   the successor s worldwide expenditures  including expenditures for legal compliance  internal environmental initiatives and remediation of active  orphan  divested and us superfund sites were million and million  respectively 
the predecessor s worldwide expenditures for the three months ended march  and the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
the successor s capital project related environmental expenditures for the year ended december   the nine months ended december   and the predecessor s for the three months ended march  and the year ended december   included in worldwide expenditures  were million  million  million and million  respectively 
environmental reserves for remediation matters were million and million as of december  and  respectively  which represents our best estimate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements it is anticipated that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on the chemical industry in general 
management cannot predict with certainty future environmental expenditures  especially expenditures beyond due to new air regulations in the us  management expects that there will be a temporary increase in compliance costs that will total approximately million to million through accordingly  emission trading systems will directly affect the power plants at the kelsterbach and oberhausen sites in germany and the lanaken site in belgium  as well as power plants operated by infraserv entities on sites at which we operate 
the company and the infraserv entities may be required to purchase carbon dioxide credits  which could result in increased operating costs  or may be required to develop additional cost effective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions further  which could result in increased capital expenditures 
additionally  the new regulation indirectly affects our other operations in the european union  which may experience higher energy costs from third party providers 
we have not yet determined the impact of this legislation on our operating costs 
due to our industrial history  we have the obligation to remediate specific areas on our active sites as well as on divested  orphan or us superfund sites 
in addition  as part of the demerger agreement with hoechst  a specified proportion of the responsibility for environmental liabilities from a number of pre demerger divestitures was transferred to us 
management has provided for such obligations when the event of loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
management believes that the environmental costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  but they may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements pension and other benefits the funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that  over the long run  will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations 
for the year ended december   the nine months ended december  and the three months ended march   pension contributions to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
contributions to the german pension plans for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  were million and million  respectively 
also for the year ended december   the nine months ended december  and the three months ended march   payments to other non qualified plans including rest of the world totaled million  million and million  respectively 
our spending associated with other benefit plans  primarily retiree medical  defined contribution and long term disability  amounted to million  million and million for the year ended december   the nine months ended december  and the three months ended march   respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  celanese amended its long term disability plan to align the benefit levels with the retiree medical plan 
as a result of this change  the employee contribution for the long term disability medical coverage increased substantially for current participants in the disability plan 
subsequent to the adoption of the change  enrollment in the plan has been trending downward  with of the participants declining coverage 
accordingly  the company reduced the disability accrual by million at december  as a result of the lower enrollment experience 
in addition  medical claims assumptions were lowered to reflect actual plan experience and the percentage of long term disability medical payments paid for by medicare 
this change lowered the long term disability accrual by an additional million 
other matters plumbing actions and sorbates litigation we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims incidental to the normal conduct of our business 
in february  we settled with an insurance carrier and received cash proceeds of million in march and in december  we received million in additional settlements 
for the nine months ended december  there were no net cash inflows in connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation 
for the three months ended march  and for the year ended december   there were net cash inflows of approximately million and million in connection with the plumbing actions and sorbates litigation 
as of december  and  there were reserves of million and million  respectively  for these matters 
in addition  we have receivables from insurance companies and hoechst in connection with the plumbing and sorbates matters of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
although it is impossible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these matters  management believes  based on the advice of legal counsel  that adequate provisions have been made and that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  but could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any material off balance arrangements 
market risks please see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under item a of this form k for additional information about our market risks 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of these financial statements and application of these policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
we believe the following accounting polices and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment 
these matters  and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them  are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of the significant accounting policies 
recoverability of long lived assets our business is capital intensive and has required  and will continue to require  significant investments in property  plant and equipment 
at december  and  the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment was  million and  million  respectively 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we assess the recoverability of property  plant and equipment to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in december  we approved a plan to dispose of the coc business included within the ticona segment 
this decision resulted in million and million of asset impairment charges recorded as a special charge related to the coc business in the year ended december  and the nine months ended december   respectively 
as a result of the planned consolidation of tow production and the termination of filament production  the acetate products segment recorded impairment charges of million associated with plant and equipment in the nine months ended december  we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level based on a two step approach 
first  the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as estimated by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit 
to the extent  that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s assets and liabilities are fair valued 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the fair value of all non goodwill assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit 
to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
as of december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of goodwill and other intangible assets  net 
as of december   no significant changes in the underlying business assumptions or circumstances that drive the impairment analysis led management to believe goodwill might have been impaired 
we will continue to evaluate the need for impairment if changes in circumstances or available information indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we perform the required impairment tests at least annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using june balances unless circumstances dictate more frequent testing 
during  we performed the impairment test and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
a prolonged general economic downturn and  specifically  a continued downturn in the chemical industry as well as other market factors could intensify competitive pricing pressure  create an imbalance of industry supply and demand  or otherwise diminish volumes or profits 
such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long lived assets 
consequently  it is possible that our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of our long lived assets 
restructuring and special charges gains special charges gains include provisions for restructuring and other expenses and income incurred outside the normal ongoing course of operations 
restructuring provisions represent costs related to severance and other benefit programs related to major activities undertaken to fundamentally redesign our operations as well as costs incurred in connection with a decision to exit non strategic businesses 
these measures are based on formal management decisions  establishment of agreements with the employees representatives or individual agreements with the affected employees as well as the public announcement of the restructuring plan 
the related reserves reflect certain estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations and other closure costs 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental liabilities we manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world 
accordingly  the businesses operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use  handling  processing  storage and transportation of hazardous materials 
we recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated 
if the event of loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  but is reasonably possible  we provide appropriate disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
total reserves for environmental liabilities were million and million at december  and  respectively 
measurement of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
an environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include  for example  provision for one or more of the following types of costs site investigation and testing costs  cleanup costs  costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post remediation monitoring costs 
these reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance 
the measurement of environmental liabilities is based on a range of management s periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort 
we use our best estimate within the range to establish our environmental reserves 
we utilize third parties to assist in the management and the development of our cost estimates for our sites 
changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur 
we accrue for legal fees related to litigation matters when the costs associated with defense can be reasonably estimated and are probable to occur 
all other fees are expensed as incurred 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations total reserves for asset retirement obligations were million and million at december  and  respectively 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
provides guidelines as to when a company is required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation 
the liability is measured at the discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded 
the corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 
management has identified but not recognized asset retirement obligations related to substantially all its existing operating facilities 
examples of these types of obligations include demolition  decommissioning  disposal and restoration activities 
legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of these assets upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of the existing operations 
however  operations at these facilities are expected to continue indefinitely and therefore a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined at this time 
in the future  we will assess strategies of the businesses acquired and may support decisions that differ from past decisions of management regarding the continuing operations of existing facilities 
asset retirement obligations will be recorded if these strategies are changed and probabilities of closure are assigned to existing facilities 
if certain operating facilities were to close  the related asset retirement obligations could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of a worldwide assessment of our acetate production capacity  the acetate products segment recorded a charge to depreciation expense of million in related to potential asset retirement obligations 
the assessment concluded that there was a probability that certain facilities would be closed in the latter half of the decade 
in october we announced plans to consolidate flake and tow production by early and to discontinue production of filament before the end of in the fourth quarter of  the operations of filament were discontinued and we disposed of two acetate properties 
as a result of the sales  we recorded a gain of million primarily resulting from the reversal of liabilities assumed by the purchaser 
for the nine months ended december   we recorded a charge of million included within depreciation expense  of which million was recorded by acetate products and million by chemical products 
realization of deferred tax assets management regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
such evaluations require significant management judgments 
valuation allowances have been established primarily for us federal and state net operating losses carryforwards  mexican net operating loss carryforwards and canadian deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
tax contingencies the company has accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
the company accrues for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it nevertheless has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by the company resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
these amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the company s potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  release of administrative guidance  or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue 
benefit obligations pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
cac sponsors pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
with respect to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan  minimum funding requirements are determined by the employee retirement income security act 
for the periods presented  the predecessor or the company had not been required to contribute under these minimum funding requirements 
however  the predecessor chose to contribute to the us defined benefit pension plan million and million for the three months ended march  and for the year ended december   respectively 
the successor chose to contribute to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan million and million for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december   respectively 
contributions to the german pension plans for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  were million and million  respectively 
benefits are generally based on years of service and or compensation 
various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on plan assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
in addition to the above mentioned assumptions  actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis 
a significant assumption used in determining our pension expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
at december  and  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan  which represents greater than and of pension plan assets and liabilities  respectively 
on average  the actual return on plan assets over the long term to years has exceeded 
for the year ended december   the us qualified defined benefit pension plan assets actual return was basis points less than the expected long term rate of return of plan assets 
however  for the year ended december   the actual return was basis points higher than the long term return on plan assets 
based on our investment strategy  we believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return 
we estimate a basis point decline in the expected long term rate of return for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to increase pension expense by an estimated million in another estimate that affects our pension and other postretirement benefit expense is the discount rate used in the annual actuarial valuations of pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations 
at the end of each year  we determine the appropriate discount rate  which represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income securities 
at december   we lowered the discount rate to from at december  for the us plans 
we estimate that a basis point decline in the discount rate for the us pension and postretirement medical plans will increase pension and other postretirement benefit annual expenses by an estimated million and less than million  respectively  and our benefit obligations by approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
over the past two years  we have experienced significant increases in excess of million in unrecognized net actuarial pension losses 
the losses were mainly due to the decline in the discount rate utilized to reflect current market conditions 
other postretirement benefit plans plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
the postretirement benefit cost for the year ended december   the nine months ended december  and the three months ended march   includes million  million and million  respectively  and the accrued post retirement liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively  in other noncurrent liabilities 
the key determinants of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo are the discount rate and the healthcare cost trend rate 
the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of apbo and related expense 
for example  increasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the apbo at december   and the postretirement benefit cost by approximately million and less than million  respectively  and decreasing the healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the apbo at december  and the postretirement benefit cost by approximately million and less than million  respectively

accounting for commitments and contingencies we are subject to a number of legal proceedings  lawsuits  claims  and investigations  incidental to the normal conduct of our business  relating to and including product liability  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  antitrust  past waste disposal practices  release of chemicals into the environment and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
management routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demands  settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel  available facts  identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute  as well as prior experience 
a determination of the amount of loss contingency required  if any  is assessed in accordance with sfas no 
contingencies and commitments and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available

cna holdings  which included the us business now conducted by the ticona segment  along with shell oil company shell and e 
i 
du pont de nemours and company dupont and others  has been a defendant in a series of lawsuits  including a number of class actions  alleging that plastics manufactured by these companies that were utilized in the production of plumbing systems for residential property were defective or caused such plumbing systems to fail 
cna holdings has accrued its best estimate of its share of the plumbing actions 
at december  and  accruals were million and million  respectively  for this matter  of which million and million  respectively  are included in current liabilities 
management believes that the plumbing actions are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
however  if we were to incur an additional charge for this matter  such a charge would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position  but may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any given accounting period 
the predecessor s receivables relating to the anticipated recoveries from third party insurance carriers for this product liability matter are based on the probability of collection on the settlement agreements reached with a majority of the insurance carriers whose coverage level exceeds the receivables and based on the status of current discussions with other insurance carriers 
as of december  and  insurance claims receivables were million and million  respectively 
collectibility could vary depending on the financial status of the insurance carriers 
nutrinova inc  a us subsidiary of nutrinova nutrition specialties food ingredients gmbh  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and the predecessor  is party to various legal proceedings in the united states  canada and europe alleging nutrinova inc engaged in unlawful anticompetitive behavior which affected the sorbates markets while it was a wholly owned subsidiary of hoechst 
in accordance with the demerger agreement between hoechst and cag  which became effective october  cag  the successor to hoechst s sorbates business  was assigned the obligation related to these matters 
however  hoechst agreed to indemnify cag for of payments for such obligations 
expenses related to this matter are recorded gross of any such recoveries from hoechst while the recoveries from hoechst  which represents of such expenses  are recorded directly to shareholders equity  net of tax  as a contribution of capital 
based on the advice of external counsel and a review of the existing facts and circumstances relating to the sorbates matter  including the status of government investigations  as well as civil claims filed and settled  we and the predecessor has remaining accruals of million and million at december  and  respectively  for the estimated loss relative to this matter 
this amount is included in current liabilities at december  although the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty  management s best estimate of the range of possible additional future losses and fines  including any that may result from governmental proceedings  as of december  is between million and million 
the estimated range of such possible future losses is management s best estimate based on advice of external counsel taking into consideration potential fines and claims  both civil and criminal  that may be imposed or made in other jurisdictions 
at december  and  we had receivables  recorded within current assets  relating to the sorbates indemnification from hoechst of million and million  respectively 
on february   celanese international corporation cic filed a private criminal action for patent infringement against china petrochemical development corporation  or cpdc  alleging that cpdc infringed cic s patent covering the manufacture of acetic acid 
cic also filed a supplementary civil brief which  in view of changes in taiwanese patent laws  was subsequently converted to a civil action alleging damages against cpdc based on a period of infringement of ten years   and based on cpdc s own data and as reported to the taiwanese securities and exchange commission 
cic s patent was held valid by the taiwanese patent office 
on august  a taiwanese court held that cpdc infringed cic s acetic acid patent and awarded cic approximately million for the period of through the judgment has been appealed 
we will not record income associated with this favorable judgment until cash is received 
cag  the purchaser  as well as a former member of cag s board of management  are defendants in various lawsuits in germany instituted by minority shareholders relating to the purchaser s acquisition of the cag shares 
while many of these lawsuits request to set aside shareholders resolutions in connection with the domination agreement  several minority shareholders had initiated special award proceedings spruchverfahren to increase the amounts of the fair cash compensation abfindung and of the guaranteed fixed annual payment ausgleich offered under the domination agreement 
as a result of these proceedings  the amount of the fair cash consideration and the guaranteed fixed annual payment offered under the domination agreement could be increased by the court so that all minority shareholders  including those who have already tendered their shares into the mandatory offer and have received the fair cash compensation  could claim the respective higher amounts 
although the court dismissed all of these proceedings in march on the grounds of inadmissibility  the dismissal has been appealed 
based upon the information available as of the date of this annual report  the outcome of the foregoing proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
a determination of the amount of loss contingency required  if any  is assessed in accordance with sfas no 
contingencies and commitments and recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available 
business combinations upon closing an acquisition  we estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as soon as practicable 
given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company s balance sheet frequently with implications for the purchase price of the acquisition  then to adjust the acquired company s accounting policies  procedures  books and records to our standards  it is often several quarters before we are able to finalize those initial fair value estimates 
accordingly  it is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised 
the judgements made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net earnings loss 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
captive insurance companies we consolidate two wholly owned insurance companies the captives 
the captives are a key component of our global risk management program as well as a form of self insurance for property  liability and workers compensation risks 
the captives issue insurance policies to our subsidiaries to provide consistent coverage amid fluctuating costs in the insurance market and to lower long term insurance costs by avoiding or reducing commercial carrier overhead and regulatory fees 
the captives issue insurance policies and coordinate claims handling services with third party service providers 
they retain risk at levels approved by management and obtain reinsurance coverage from third parties to limit the net risk retained 
one of the captives also insures certain third party risks 
the assets of the captives consist primarily of marketable securities and reinsurance receivables 
marketable securities values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
the carrying value of the amounts recoverable under the reinsurance agreements approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these items 
the liabilities recorded by the captives relate to the estimated risk of loss recorded by the captives  which is based on management estimates and actuarial valuations  and unearned premiums  which represent the portion of the premiums written applicable to the terms of the policies in force 
the establishment of the provision for outstanding losses is based upon known facts and interpretation of circumstances influenced by a variety of factors 
in establishing a provision  management considers facts currently known and the current state of laws and litigation where applicable 
liabilities are recognized for known claims when sufficient information has been developed to indicate involvement of a specific policy and management can reasonably estimate their liability 
in addition  liabilities have been established to cover additional exposure on both known and unasserted claims 
estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly 
it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 
the captives use reinsurance arrangements to reduce their risk of loss 
reinsurance arrangements however do not relieve the captives from their obligations to policyholders 
failure of the reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the captives 
the captives evaluate the financial condition of their reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to minimize their exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies and establish allowances for amounts deemed non collectable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks we are exposed to market risk through commercial and financial operations 
our market risk consists principally of exposure to currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we have in place policies of hedging against changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices as described below 
contracts to hedge exposures are accounted for under sfas no

foreign exchange risk management we and the predecessor have receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the various subsidiaries  which create foreign exchange risk 
for the purposes of this document  the predecessor s reporting currency is the us dollar  and the functional reporting currency of cag continues to be the euro 
the us dollar  the euro  mexican peso  japanese yen  british pound sterling  and canadian dollar are the most significant sources of currency risk 
accordingly  we enter into foreign currency forwards and swaps to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
the foreign currency contracts are designated for recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions 
the terms of these contracts are generally under one year 
our centralized hedging strategy states that foreign currency denominated receivables or liabilities recorded by the operating entities will be internally hedged  only the remaining net foreign exchange position will then be hedged externally with banks 
as a result  foreign currency forward contracts relating to this centralized strategy did not meet the criteria of sfas no 
to qualify for hedge accounting 
net foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized on the underlying transactions  which are offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts 
on june   as part of our currency risk management  we entered into a currency swap with certain financial institutions 
under the terms of the swap arrangement  we will pay approximately million in interest and receive approximately million in interest on each june and december with interest for the first period prorated 
upon maturity of the swap agreement on june   we will pay approximately million and receive approximately million 
we designated the swap  part of its senior euro term loan and a euro note as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of at december  and  the effects of the swap resulted in an increase in total liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the loss related to the swap was million and million for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december   of which million in and million in is related to the ineffectiveness of the net investment hedge 
contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  are predominantly in euros  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollars 
most of the our foreign currency forward contracts did not meet the criteria of sfas no 
to qualify for hedge accounting 
we recognize net foreign currency transaction gains or losses  which were offset by losses and gains related to foreign currency forward contracts 
at december  our foreign currency forward contracts resulted in an decrease in total assets of million and a decrease in total liabilities of million 
for the year ended december   our foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets and an increase in total liabilities of million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  these contracts  in addition to natural hedges  hedged approximately of our net receivables held in currencies other than the entities functional currency for our european operations 
related to the unhedged portion during the period  a net gain loss of approximately million  million and million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense  net for the six months ended december   for the nine months ended december  and the three months ended march   respectively 
during  the predecessor s foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a decrease in total assets and of million and an increase in total liabilities of million 
as of december   these contracts hedged a portion approximately of the predecessor s us dollar denominated intercompany net receivables held by euro denominated entities 
related to the unhedged portion  a net loss of approximately million from foreign exchange gains or losses was recorded to other income expense  net in a substantial portion of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than us dollar  principally the euro 
fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar  particularly the value of the euro  can have  and in the past have had  a direct and material impact on the business and financial results 
for example  a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar  results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales denominated in euros and earnings due to translation effects 
likewise  an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect 
we estimate that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately and decreased total assets by approximately for the year ended december   increased net sales by approximately and increased total assets by approximately for the nine months ended december  net sales increased by approximately for the year ended december  the predecessor estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar increased net sales by approximately for the three months ended march  and by approximately for the year ended december  the predecessor also estimated that the translation effects of changes in the value of other currencies against the us dollar decreased total assets by approximately for the three months ended march  and increased total assets by approximately in exposure to transactional effects is further reduced by a high degree of overlap between the currencies in which sales are denominated and the currencies in which the raw material and other costs of goods sold are denominated 
as of december   we had total debt of  million  of which million million is euro denominated debt 
a increase in foreign exchange rates would increase the euro denominated debt by million 
as of december   we had total cash of million  of which approximately million million is euro denominated cash 
a decrease in foreign exchange rates would decrease the euro denominated cash by million 
for the year ended december   the euro denominated cash was reduced substantially by the purchase of the additional cag shares from two shareholders  including other considerations  as well as the acquisition of vinamul and acetex and the redemption of acetex s debt 
interest rate risk management we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of interest rate risk inherent in our outstanding debt by locking in borrowing rates to achieve a desired level of fixed floating rate debt depending on market conditions 
at december   the successor had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
at december   the successor had no interest rate swap agreements in place 
the predecessor had open interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million at december  in the second quarter of  the successor recorded a loss of less than million in other income expense  net associated with the early termination of its million interest rate swap 
during  the predecessor recorded a loss of million in other income expense  net  associated with the early termination of one of its interest rate swaps 
the successor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of million and million for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december   respectively 
the predecessor recognized net interest expense from hedging activities relating to interest rate swaps of million and million for the three months ended march  and the year ended december   respectively 
the predecessor recorded a net gain loss of less than million and million in other income expense  net of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps  during the three months ended march  and the year ended december   respectively 
on a pro forma basis as of december   we had approximately  million of variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
commodity risk management our policy for the majority of our natural gas and butane requirements allows entering into supply agreements and forward purchase or cash settled swap contracts 
fixed price natural gas forward contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity 
the maturities of the cash settled swap contracts correlate to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices for the underlying commodity 
although these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
these cash settled swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
realized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract 
the successor recognized losses of less than million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  the predecessor recognized losses of million and million from natural gas swaps and butane contracts for the three months ended march  and the year ended december   respectively 
there was no material impact on the balance sheet at december  and there were no unrealized gains and losses associated with the cash settled swap contracts as of december  and we did not have any open commodity swaps as of december  and
