hortons filed its initial form s with the sec on december  and is projecting to complete the ipo by the end of the first quarter of the company would retain the remaining of the hortons business 
the planned ipo preserves the ability to complete a tax free spin off of hortons to wendy s shareholders if the board decides to pursue such an initiative in the future  however  wendy s has agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of its remaining interest for a period of days after the effective date of the form s filing 
the company currently intends  assuming a successful ipo  to spin off hortons common stock that it owns as soon as practical  which is expected to occur by december  factors leading to the decision to pursue a hortons ipo include significant unit growth and average same store sales improvements of more than per year since  hortons improved ability to internally fund its growth  hortons success with several vertical integration initiatives  including its par baking initiative with its joint venture partner  and improved performance of the hortons us operations 
if the hortons ipo is completed as planned  the company would reflect the minority interest in its financial statements 
this would effectively reduce the company s net income by that amount unless the company s ongoing operations are able to replace the lost income

table of contents operating income growth guidance in february  the company stated its anticipated operating income growth to be in the range of to from million reported in to a range of to million in revenue in is expected to increase to over eps in will be very dependent on planned completion of the hortons ipo and the possible repurchase of common shares of the company 
both the planned ipo of hortons and recent increases in the company s dividend have been initiated to enhance total return to shareholders 
ongoing initiatives the company continues to implement its strategic initiatives 
these initiatives include leveraging the company s core assets  growing average same store sales  improving store level productivity to enhance margins  improving underperforming operations  developing profitable new restaurants and implementing new technology initiatives 
management intends to allocate resources to improve long term return on assets and invested capital  and monitor its progress by tracking various metrics  including return on average assets  return on average equity and return on invested capital  as well as comparing to historical performance  the company s peers and other leading companies 
the company also continues to execute its integrated financial strategy announced in that includes a focus on a dividend policy  continued share repurchases  an equity based compensation program for employees and directors and stock ownership guidelines for company officers 
in  the company obtained shareholder approval of its plan which has the objectives of remaining competitive in attracting and retaining employees  lowering overhang and minimizing eps dilution from equity based compensation grants over the next several years 
the plan allows for the transition from stock options to a combination of restricted stock and restricted stock units 
the company also developed a new cash bonus profit sharing program that generally applies to non executive employees 
in an effort to further align employee and shareholder goals  the company also established stock ownership guidelines which include requiring officers to hold company stock and in the money stock options equal to their annual base salary  and the named executive officers  as established in the proxy statement  to hold company stock and in the money stock options equal to three times their annual base salary

the goal of these strategies is to increase average sales over time  primarily through greater customer traffic in the restaurants 
the company intends to effectively manage corporate and field level costs to control overall general and administrative expense 
new restaurant development will continue to be very important to the company 
wendy s  hortons and baja fresh restaurant concepts are all under penetrated in key markets 
the company intends to grow responsibly  focusing on the markets with the best potential for sales and return on investment 
a total of new restaurants were opened in current plans call for to new company and franchise restaurants to open in the primary focus will be on core operations of wendy s in north america and hortons in canada  with the majority of units being standard sites 
the company is optimistic about the development of hortons in the us the company s strategy for hortons us is to enhance brand awareness  increase average same store sales  build customer loyalty and attract additional franchisees 

table of contents in  the company plans to develop to new hortons franchise units in the us management believes that hortons us has the potential to become a long term growth opportunity through further development in existing markets  entering into new markets  acquisitions and entering into area development agreements with franchisees 
however  there is no assurance that the anticipated growth will occur 
another element of the company s strategic plan is the evaluation of potential mergers  acquisitions  joint venture investments  alliances  vertical integration opportunities and divestitures that could add to the company s long term earnings growth  such as the joint venture between hortons and iaws group plc formed in to build a par baked goods manufacturing facility in canada 
the company s developing brands segment consists of baja fresh and cafe express 
baja fresh is in the mexican segment of fast casual restaurants and currently represents about of the company s revenues 
in and  baja fresh was not profitable due primarily to declining average same store sales 
in  the company recognized a pretax charge of million as a result of closing five baja fresh underperforming restaurants 
in the company closed and impaired a number of underperforming restaurants and recorded a million goodwill impairment  with a goal of improving performance 
the results for baja fresh reflect improved margins but not significantly improved operating income over the company s strategy includes strengthening the management team  improving unit level economics  evolving the concept and positioning for future growth 
the company believes the concept has the potential to contribute to earnings long term 
nevertheless  as with all developing companies  there are challenges to gaining customer acceptance and the industry is extremely competitive 
similar to baja fresh  cafe express is an evolving concept targeting to improve its unit level economics and position itself for future growth 
currently  cafe express is not profitable and in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a pretax charge of million for the impairment of cafe express goodwill and recognized a million pretax charge related to the impairment of a market 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as of january  and january  as that term is described by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue recognition wendy s and baja fresh have a significant number of company operated restaurants  while hortons is predominately franchised 
revenue at company operated restaurants is recognized as customers pay for products at the time of sale 
hortons operates warehouses in canada to distribute coffee and other dry goods to an extensive franchise system 
revenues from these sales are recorded when the product is delivered to the franchisee 
franchise revenues consist of royalties  rents  various franchise fees and gains and losses on the sale of properties to franchisees 
royalties and rent revenues are recognized in the month earned at estimated realizable amounts 
franchise fee revenues are recognized when the related services have been performed and when the related franchise store is opened 
the application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the results of operations of the company 
the earnings reporting process is covered by the company s system of internal controls  and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments 
however  estimates and judgments are inherent in the calculations of royalty and other franchise related revenue collections  legal obligations  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  insurance liabilities  various other commitments and contingencies  valuations used when assessing potential impairment of goodwill  
table of contents other intangibles and other long lived assets and the estimation of the useful lives of fixed assets and other long lived assets 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could vary from these assumptions 
it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions 
the company collects royalties  and in some cases rent  from franchisees and hortons collects distribution revenues from canadian franchisees 
the company provides for estimated losses for revenues that are not likely to be collected 
although the company generally enjoys a good relationship with franchisees  and collection rates are currently very high  if average sales or the financial health of franchisees were to deteriorate  the company might have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
the company is self insured for most domestic workers compensation  health care claims  general liability and automotive liability losses 
the company records its insurance liabilities based on historical and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
outside actuaries are used to assist in estimating casualty insurance obligations 
since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in recording insurance liabilities  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities 
workers compensation insurance can particularly involve significant time before the ultimate resolution of claims 
wendy s had accrued million and million at year end and  respectively  for domestic workers compensation liabilities  domestic general liability  domestic automotive liability and other property liabilities 
in canada  workers compensation benefits are part of a government sponsored plan and although the company and its employees make contributions to that plan  management is not involved in determining these amounts 
pension and other retirement benefits  including all relevant assumptions required by generally accepted accounting principles  are evaluated each year with the oversight of the company s retirement committee 
due to the technical nature of retirement accounting  outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations 
market interest rates are reviewed to establish pension plan discount rates and expected returns on plan assets are based on the mix of investments and expected market returns 
since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations 
if the company were to change its discount rate by  this would change annual pension costs by million 
if the company were to change its long term return on assets rate by  this would change annual pension costs by million 
in the normal course of business  the company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
the company records income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
when considered necessary  the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when the company determines that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 

table of contents depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method in amounts adequate to amortize costs over the following estimated useful lives buildings and leasehold improvements and property under capital leases  the lesser of the useful life of the asset up to years or the lease term  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended  restaurant equipment  up to years  and other equipment  up to years 
the company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment based on historical data and industry trends 
the company capitalizes certain internally developed software costs which are amortized over a period of up to years 
the company monitors its capitalization and amortization policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
intangibles separate from goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over periods of up to years 
lives may be related to legal or contractual lives  or must be estimated by management based on specific circumstances 
long lived assets are grouped into operating markets and tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist 
the company tests for impairment using the cash flows of the operating markets 
a significant deterioration in the cash flows of an operating market or other circumstances may trigger impairment testing 
if an impairment is indicated  the fair value of the fixed assets is estimated using the discounted cash flows or third party appraisals of the operating market 
the interest rate used in preparing discounted cash flows is management s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or in interim periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit  as measured by discounted cash flows and market multiples based on earnings  to the carrying value  to determine if there is an indication that a potential impairment may exist 
one of the most significant assumptions is the projection of future sales 
the company reviews its assumptions each time goodwill is tested for impairment and makes appropriate adjustments  if any  based on facts and circumstances available at that time 
in the fourth quarter of  the company tested goodwill for impairment and recorded an impairment charge totaling million related to cafe express and hortons us operations based upon an estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units based on historical performance  discounted cash flow projections and comparative market data 
in the fourth quarter of  the company tested goodwill for impairment and recorded an impairment charge of million related to baja fresh 
the company  with the assistance of an independent third party  determined the amount of the charge  which was primarily based on comparative market data 
both baja fresh and cafe express are included in the developing brands segment
