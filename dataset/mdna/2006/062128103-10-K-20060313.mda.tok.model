usa patriot act 
the terrorist attacks in september  have impacted the financial services industry and led to federal legislation that attempts to address certain issues involving financial institutions 
on october   president bush signed into law the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act 
part of the usa patriot act is the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of imla 
imla authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to banks  bank holding companies  and other financial institutions 
these measures may include enhanced recordkeeping and reporting requirements for certain financial transactions that are of primary money laundering concern  due diligence requirements concerning the beneficial ownership of certain types of accounts  and restrictions or prohibitions on certain types of accounts with foreign financial institutions 

table of contents among its other provisions  imla requires each financial institution to i establish an anti money laundering program  ii establish due diligence policies  procedures and controls with respect to its private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks  and iii avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the united states for  or on behalf of  a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  imla contains a provision encouraging cooperation among financial institutions  regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals  entities and organizations engaged in  or reasonably suspected of engaging in  terrorist acts or money laundering activities 
imla expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
imla also amends the bhc act and the bank merger act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts 
transactions with affiliates 
in addition to the limitations imposed by regulation w  there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the banks may engage in loan transactions with the company and its subsidiaries and other affiliates 
subject to certain limited exceptions  the banks may not extend credit to the company or any one of the banks affiliates in excess of ten percent of the bank s capital stock and surplus  or to all affiliates  in the aggregate  in excess of twenty percent of the banks capital stock and surplus 
all extensions of credit by the banks to an affiliate must be fully collateralized by high quality collateral 
transactions involving extensions of credit to the banks affiliates are subject to further limitations 
these additional limitations are also applicable to transactions involving the purchase of assets or securities from affiliates  extensions of credit and other transactions by the banks to or with third persons where there is a benefit to an affiliate  contracts in which the banks provide services to an affiliate  and transactions in which an affiliate receives a brokerage commission in a transaction involving the banks 
all such transactions must be on terms and under circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the banks as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies 
dividends 
the company s ability to pay cash dividends will depend almost entirely upon the amount of dividends that the banks are permitted to pay by statutes or regulations 
additionally  the florida business corporation act provides that the company may only pay dividends if the dividend payment would not render it insolvent  or unable to meet its obligations as they come due 
effective january   all of the banks and the trust company are florida state chartered institutions 
the department limits the banks ability to pay dividends 
as state chartered institutions  the banks and the trust company are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends  including a prohibition of payment of dividends from their capital under certain circumstances without the prior approval of the department 
except with the prior approval of the department  all dividends of any florida bank or trust company must be paid out of retained net profits from the current period and the previous two years  after deducting expenses  including losses and bad debts 
in addition  state chartered banks and trust companies in florida are required to transfer at least of their net income to surplus until their surplus equals the amount of paid in capital 
the company does not anticipate that the subsidiary banks will pay dividends in the foreseeable future in so that they can maintain their well capitalized status and retain any earnings to support their growth 
capital requirements 
the federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies 
the resulting capital ratios represent qualifying capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines are minimums  and the federal regulators have noted that banks and bank holding companies contemplating significant expansion programs should not allow expansion to diminish their capital ratios and should maintain all ratios well in excess of the minimums 
the current guidelines require all bank holding companies and federally regulated banks to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio equal to  of which at least must be tier capital 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  but excludes goodwill and most other intangibles and excludes the allowance for loan and lease losses 
tier capital includes the excess of any preferred stock not included in tier capital  mandatory convertible securities  hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  and general reserves for loan and lease losses up to of risk weighted assets 

table of contents fdicia contains prompt corrective action provisions pursuant to which banks are to be classified into one of five categories based upon capital adequacy  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized and which require subject to certain exceptions the appropriate federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action with respect to an institution which becomes significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in general  the regulations define the five capital categories as follows i an institution is well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  has a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any written capital order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures  ii an institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and has a leverage ratio of or greater  iii an institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  has a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or has a leverage ratio that is less than  iv an institution is significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage ratio that is less than  and v an institution is critically undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or less than of its total assets 
the fdic also  after an opportunity for a hearing  has authority to downgrade an institution from well capitalized to adequately capitalized or to subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower category  for supervisory concerns 
the degree of regulatory scrutiny of a financial institution will increase  and the permissible activities of the institution will decrease  as it moves downward through the capital categories 
institutions that fall into one of the three undercapitalized categories may be required to i submit a capital restoration plan  ii raise additional capital  iii restrict their growth  deposit interest rates  and other activities  iv improve their management  v eliminate management fees  or vi divest themselves of all or part of their operations 
bank holding companies controlling financial institutions can be called upon to boost the institutions capital and to partially guarantee the institutions performance under their capital restoration plans 
these capital guidelines can affect the company in several ways 
the company s capital levels are in excess of those required to be maintained by a well capitalized financial institution 
however  rapid growth  poor loan portfolio performance  or poor earnings performance  or a combination of these factors  could change the company s capital position in a relatively short period of time  making an additional capital infusion necessary 
enforcement powers 
congress has provided the federal bank regulatory agencies with an array of powers to enforce laws  rules  regulations and orders 
among other things  the agencies may require that institutions cease and desist from certain activities  may preclude persons from participating in the affairs of insured depository institutions  may suspend or remove deposit insurance  and may impose civil money penalties against institution affiliated parties for certain violations 
maximum legal interest rates 
like the laws of many states  florida law contains provisions on interest rates that may be charged by banks and other lenders on certain types of loans 
numerous exceptions exist to the general interest limitations imposed by florida law 
the relative importance of these interest limitation laws to the financial operations of the banks will vary from time to time  depending on a number of factors  including conditions in the money markets  the costs and availability of funds  and prevailing interest rates 
bank branching 
banks in florida are permitted to branch statewide 
a state bank s expansion is subject to the department and fdic approval 
any such approval would take into consideration several factors  including the banks level of capital  the prospects and economics of the proposed branch office  and other conditions deemed relevant for purposes of determining whether approval should be granted to open a branch office 
for information regarding legislation on interstate branching in florida  see interstate banking below 
change of control 
federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company and a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators 
the overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation 
consequently  shareholders of the company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies 
under the change in bank control act and the regulations thereunder  a person or group must give advance notice to the federal reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company 
upon receipt of such notice  the federal reserve may approve or disapprove the acquisition 
the change in bank control act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding company s or bank s voting stock  or if one or more other control factors set forth in the change in bank control act are present 

table of contents interstate banking 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
under this law  interstate acquisitions of banks or bank holding companies in any state by bank holding companies in any other state are permissible subject to certain limitations 
florida also has a law that allows out of state bank holding companies located in states that allow florida bank holding companies to acquire banks and bank holding companies in that state to acquire florida banks and florida bank holding companies 
the law essentially provides for out of state entry by acquisition only and not by interstate branching and requires the acquired florida bank to have been in existence for at least three years 
interstate branching and consolidation of existing bank subsidiaries in different states are permissible 
a florida bank may also establish  maintain  and operate one or more branches in a state other than florida pursuant to an interstate merger transaction in which the florida bank is the resulting bank 
effect of governmental policies 
the earnings and businesses of the company and the banks are affected by the policies of various regulatory authorities of the united states  especially the federal reserve 
the federal reserve  among other things  regulates the supply of credit and deals with general economic conditions within the united states

item a 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves risk 
in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this report  the following factors relating to us and our common stock should be carefully considered in deciding whether to invest in our common stock 
though we turned profitable in the second quarter of  we have incurred cumulative operating losses since we commenced operations and may continue to incur losses in the future since we commenced our operations on august   we have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
this deficit is primarily due to the costs of establishing our business strategy  which included opening bank of florida southwest  bank of florida trust company  bank of florida in fort lauderdale and bank of florida tampa bay  and the continuing expansion of our banking activities in our markets  as well as the impact of historically low interest rates and other factors 
we may charter additional banks in the future 
a newly formed bank is typically expected to incur operating losses in its early periods of operations because of an inability to generate sufficient net interest income to cover operating expenses 
those operating losses can be significant and can occur for longer periods than planned  depending on the new bank s ability to control operating expenses and generate net interest income 
there is a risk that losses at our new subsidiaries may exceed profits at our existing subsidiaries 
we may encounter unexpected financial and operating problems due to our rapid growth we have grown significantly since we opened our first bank subsidiary  bank of florida southwest  in our total assets have grown to approximately million as of december  our rapid growth may result in unexpected financial and operating problems  including problems in our loan portfolio due to its unseasoned nature  and turnover or rapid increases in members of management and staff  which may affect the value of our shares 
the addition of our new bank in tampa and our boca raton office may add additional pressures to our internal control systems  and our financial and operating success will depend in large part on our success in integrating these operations 
in addition  if our loan and asset growth continues at its current pace  it may be difficult to retain our and our subsidiaries well capitalized designations with the federal deposit insurance corporation 
if we or our bank subsidiaries fall below being well capitalized to adequately capitalized  we may sell participations in some of our loans in order to decrease the amount of our assets 
this could result in lower earnings due to our retaining a lower level of earning assets 

table of contents our growth strategy may not be successful as a strategy  we have sought to increase the size of our franchise through rapid growth and by aggressively pursuing business development opportunities 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be successful in increasing the volume of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms and expanding our asset base while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with this growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that any further expansion will be profitable or that we will continue to be able to sustain our historical rate of growth  either through internal growth or through other successful expansions of our banking markets  or that we will be able to maintain capital sufficient to support our continued growth 
losses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance we establish for that purpose  which will have an adverse effect on our business if a significant number of loans are not repaid  it would have an adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses reflects our management s best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
this evaluation is primarily based upon a review of our and the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  known risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  and economic factors 
however  the determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions 
as a result  our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses  and future provisions for loan losses may adversely affect our earnings 
if real estate values in our target markets decline  our loan portfolio would be impaired a significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of mortgages secured by real estate located in the collier lee county markets 
we have also been generating a significant amount of real estate secured loans in our broward palm beach county and hillsborough county markets 
real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by  among other things  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in the tax laws and other governmental statutes  regulations and policies  and acts of nature 
if real estate prices decline in any of these markets  the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans could be reduced 
such a reduction in the value of our collateral could increase the number of non performing loans and adversely affect our financial performance 
if we lose key employees  our business may suffer our success is largely dependent on the personal contacts of our officers and employees in our market areas 
if we lose key employees  temporarily or permanently  our business could be hurt 
we could be particularly hurt if our key employees went to work for our competitors 
our future success depends on the continued contributions of our existing senior management personnel  including our president and chief executive officer michael l 
mcmullan  chief operating officer martin p 
mahan  and our chief lending officer craig d 
sherman 
in each of our markets  we are also dependent on the presidents and chief executive officers of our subsidiaries 
we have entered into employment contracts with many of our key executive officers which contain standard non competition provisions to help alleviate some of this risk 
our executive officers and directors have substantial control over our company  which could delay or prevent a change of control favored by our other shareholders our executive officers and directors  if acting together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including elections of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
our executive officers and directors own approximately  shares  representing approximately of the total number of shares outstanding and will have vested options and warrants to acquire approximately  additional shares 
the interest of these shareholders may differ from the interests of our other shareholders  and these shareholders  acting together  will be able to influence all matters requiring approval by shareholders 
as a result  these shareholders could approve or cause us to take actions of which you may disapprove or that may be contrary to your interests and those of other investors 

table of contents our subsidiary banks face strong competition in their market areas that may limit their asset growth and profitability our primary market areas are the urban areas on the east and west coasts of south florida and the central west coast of florida 
the banking business in these areas is extremely competitive  and the level of competition facing us following our expansion plans may increase further  which may limit our asset growth and profitability 
each of our subsidiary banks experiences competition in both lending and attracting funds from other banks  savings institutions  and non bank financial institutions located within its market area  many of which are significantly larger institutions 
non bank competitors competing for deposits and deposit type accounts include mortgage bankers and brokers  finance companies  credit unions  securities firms  money market funds  life insurance companies and the mutual funds industry 
for loans  we encounter competition from other banks  savings associations  finance companies  mortgage bankers and brokers  insurance companies  small loan and credit card companies  credit unions  pension trusts and securities firms 
if adverse economic conditions in our target markets exist for a prolonged period  our financial results could be adversely affected our success will depend in large part on economic conditions in southeast and southwest florida  as well as the tampa bay area 
a prolonged economic downturn or recession in these markets could increase our nonperforming assets  which would result in operating losses  impaired liquidity and the erosion of capital 
a variety of factors could cause such an economic dislocation or recession  including adverse developments in the industries in these areas such as tourism  or natural disasters such as hurricanes  floods or tornadoes  or additional terrorist activities such as those our country experienced in september bancshares of florida and its subsidiaries operate in an environment highly regulated by state and federal government  changes in federal and state banking laws and regulations could have a negative impact on bancshares of florida s business 
as a bank holding company  bancshares of florida is regulated primarily by the federal reserve board 
our current subsidiaries are regulated primarily by the florida office of financial regulation and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
federal and various state laws and regulations govern numerous aspects of the banks operations  including adequate capital and financial condition  permissible types and amounts of extensions of credit and investments  permissible non banking activities  and restrictions on dividend payments 
federal and state regulatory agencies have extensive discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies 
bancshares of florida and its subsidiaries also undergo periodic examinations by one or more regulatory agencies 
following such examinations  bancshares of florida may be required  among other things  to change its asset valuations or the amounts of required loan loss allowances or to restrict its operations 
those actions would result from the regulators judgments  based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
regulatory action could severely limit future expansion plans to carry out some of our expansion plans  bancshares of florida is required to obtain permission from the federal reserve board 
application for the formation of new banks and the acquisition of existing banks are submitted to the state and federal bank regulatory agencies for their approval 
the future climate for regulatory approval is impossible to predict 
regulatory agencies could prohibit or otherwise significantly restrict the expansion plans of bancshares of florida  its current subsidiaries and future new start up banks  which could limit our ability to increase revenue 
investors may face dilution resulting from the issuance of common stock in the future we have the power to issue common stock without shareholder approval  up to the number of authorized shares set forth in our articles of incorporation 
our board of directors may determine from time to time a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other securities  subject to limitations imposed by nasdaq and the federal reserve board 
there can be no assurance that such shares can be issued at prices or on terms better than or equal to the terms obtained by our current shareholders 
the issuance of any additional shares of common stock by us in the future may result in a reduction of the book value or market price  if any  of the then outstanding common stock 
issuance of additional shares of common stock will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our existing shareholders 

table of contents shares of our preferred stock may be issued in the future which could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock pursuant to our articles of incorporation  we have the authority to issue additional series of preferred stock and to determine the designations  preferences  rights and qualifications or restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action of the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be materially adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued by us in the future 
our common stock is not an insured bank deposit and is subject to market risk our shares of common stock are not deposits  savings accounts or other obligations of us  our subsidiaries or any other depository institution  are not guaranteed by us or any other entity  and are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency 
we may need additional capital in the future and this capital may not be available when needed or at all we may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the near future to fund future growth and meet our capital needs 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain future financing  we may not have the resources available to fund our planned growth 
future sales of our common stock could depress the price of the common stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our shareholders  or the perception that such sales are likely to occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we have not paid dividends in the past and we are restricted in our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain earnings to finance operations and the expansion of our business 
therefore  any gains from your investment in our common stock must come from an increase in its market price 
in addition  we are a holding company with no independent sources of revenue and would likely rely upon cash dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund any cash dividends we decided to pay to our shareholders 
payment of dividends by our subsidiaries may be prohibited by certain regulatory restrictions 
there are substantial regulatory limitations on ownership of our common stock and changes of control with certain limited exceptions  federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be acting in concert from  directly or indirectly  acquiring or more if the acquiror is a bank holding company of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct our management or our policies without prior notice or application to and the approval of the federal reserve board 
although publicly traded  our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the nasdaq national market  and our price may fluctuate in the future although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  the trading market in our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for companies quoted on the nasdaq national market 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future  and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
general market price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  and have the greatest potential impact on the company s stated results of operations 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes that  of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our management has discussed these critical accounting assumptions and estimates with the board of directors audit committee 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to operations 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of a loan balance is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a component for individual loan impairment measured according to sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and a measure of collective loan impairment according to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
this estimate is based upon management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
estimates for loan losses are derived by analyzing historical loss experience  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  historical peer bank experience  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
larger impaired credits that are measured according to sfas no 
have been defined to include loans which are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention risk grades where the borrower relationship is greater than  for such loans that are considered impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
loans made outside the scope of sfas no 
are measured according to sfas no 
and include commercial and commercial real estate loans that are performing or have not been specifically identified under sfas no 
 and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans evaluated based on regulatory guidelines and historical peer bank loss experience which are adjusted for qualitative factors 

table of contents income taxes provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements  as well as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in the event of changes in the tax laws  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in the period of the enactment of those changes  with the cumulative effects included in the current year s income tax provision 
net deferred tax assets  whose realization is dependent on taxable earnings of future years  are recognized when a more likely than not criterion is met

our new de novo bank in the tampa bay market  which opened in november  ended the year with million in loans outstanding 
management believes that general economic conditions in the company s primary operating areas  including the real estate markets  continue to be healthy due to steady growth in population  personal income  and demand for property and services  which explain the continued strong loan demand for the company s lending products 
as indicated in the loan portfolio table in item  commercial loans not secured by real estate ended the year at million  up million or from a year earlier 
commercial loans secured by real estate  including construction loans  approximated million of the total million in real estate loans at december   compared to an approximate million of the million in real estate loans at december  as a result  the combined growth in loans to commercial borrowers was million or over the year 
consequently  commercial loans comprised million or of loans outstanding as of year end  up from million or of loans outstanding at year end when family residential real estate used to secured commercial borrowings is considered  total commercial loan borrowings constituted approximately million or of year end loans outstanding 
while the company is positioned to serve the seasonal working capital needs of its customers  its primary focus is on commercial real estate term and commercial construction loans 
the company generally does not seek to purchase or participate in loans of other institutions outside its operating area due to the adequacy of demand in its operating area  the desire for a long term  face to face working relationship  including providing depositor services  and a belief that asset quality can be more effectively monitored within its local market area

the ft 
lauderdale bank ended the year with a dda total deposit ratio of compared to that of the naples bank at  reflective of the latter s more cd oriented market place 
a good share of company wide growth in cds of million came from national market cds  which the naples bank has used as a source to fund the increase in its loans 
this funding source  which the company has found to be reliable and frequently at a lower cost than local market cds  increased from million at year end to million at year end as of that date  total cds constituted million or to total deposits  down slightly from a mix a year earlier 
non interest bearing demand deposits reached million at year end  an increase of million or over the prior year 
most of the growth million occurred at the ft

demand deposits constituted approximately of total deposits at year end compared to at year end the company s core deposits  using the industry definition which excludes national market cds and time deposits of  or more  ended at million  an increase of million or from one year earlier 
national market cds constituted of total deposits at december  versus a year earlier 
time deposits of  or more at year end comprised of total deposits  somewhat higher than its peers owing to the nature of its depositor base being generally larger commercial or private banking customers with typically higher balances  as such  the company considers these deposits to be frequently as reliable as core deposits under  subordinated debt during june  bank of florida southwest issued million in subordinated debt to a local community bank

table of contents in addition to establishing its operation in palm beach county  which began to be developed in march  and opening the tampa bay bank  which began with the purchase of bank of florida  tampa bay in organization in august  the company incurred additional expense in writing off the deferred costs of a bank acquisition in pembroke pines  florida  which was terminated in september the combined net costs of these activities  including all related expenses before and since the opening of these locations  net of offsetting revenues  is defined in this md a as net expansion costs 
the company considers it useful to identify the impact of these expansion activities compared to the activities of its established naples  fort lauderdale  and trust company franchises 
improved results of million in the naples  fort lauderdale excluding the palm beach county location  and trust company franchises enabled the increase in the company s net loss to be held to  compared to  despite s net expansion costs of million

table of contents for as a whole  top line revenue rose by million or  nearly double the million or rise in the company considers top line revenue to be useful in explaining financial performance  as it combines both the company s lending or spread income business interest income less interest expense and its fee income business  both of which often pertain to the same customer base and can be matched against the underlying noninterest expense to generate those revenue components 
top line revenue equals net interest income before provision for loan losses plus noninterest income  exclusive of gain loss on sale of investment securities 
the increase in top line revenue of million compares to a million rise up in noninterest expense  million of this increase reflects costs related to establishing our palm beach county and tampa bay operations and a loss taken on terminating a proposed merger with horizon financial corp 
the resulting net improvement of  including  fewer net gains on securities and miscellaneous transactions was more than offset by  in additional loan loss provision expense due to growth in loans 
the noninterest income component of top line revenue climbed an impressive for all of  two thirds of which reflected higher trust fees and the balance related to banking service charges  commissions  and fees 
however  vigorous loan growth drove the net interest income component up an even greater  bringing noninterest income as a percent of top line revenue down percentage points to 
excluding the expansion costs of tampa bay  palm beach county  and the horizon acquisition write off  noninterest expense for the year rose million or 
the increase in non interest expense in compared to the prior year was largely due to the cost of readying and staffing the company s new operations center to support the larger organization  including conversion costs to a new core data processing vendor  annual increases in the cost of leased quarters  and timing of certain personnel costs 
including expansion expense  the company s efficiency ratio was compared to in the prior year  which contained no expansion expense  excluding expansion expense and revenues from the tampa bay and palm beach county markets  the company s efficiency ratio improved even further to 
lastly  the provision for loan losses  which builds the allowance for loan losses after the impact of net charge offs  increased by  or in to  largely due to general credit risks related to vigorous loan growth of during the year 
the loan loss allowance ended at million  up over the last twelve months 
the company s net loss before provision for loan losses was million  a  or improvement over the prior year 
the company considers this measurement an important indication of the size of its earnings stream top line revenue less non interest expense and its ability to absorb loan loss provisioning caused by rapid loan growth 
because the requirement to provide for an allowance for loan losses coincides with loan growth  it may take several months before the net interest income on loan growth covers the associated provision for loan losses 
the larger the company s earnings stream becomes  the less the disproportionate impact on profitability of the preceding provisioning 
net interest income net interest income increased million or in to million 
net interest spread  the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was on average in  a slight increase of basis points over the prior year 
in addition  the net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  averaged in  a basis points increase over as shown by the table in item rate volume analysis of net interest income  the million increase in s net interest income reflects the impact of higher earning asset volumes more than compensating for the increase in outstanding interest bearing liabilities 
higher volumes virtually all due to loan growth  enhanced by the impact of a lower mix of interest bearing liabilities  increased net interest income by million  offset by  less net interest income due to earning assets yields falling faster than rates on interest bearing liabilities

for purposes of this analysis  non accruing loans  if any  are included in the average balance outstanding 

table of contents interest income increased million or to million in  reflective of continued strong loan growth coupled with the impact of five quarter point prime rate increases in the third and fourth quarters of approximately of loans outstanding immediately adjust to a prime rate change  which resulted in a basis point improvement in the fourth quarter loan yield compared to the second quarter loan yield 
though loan growth was vigorous during the year  deposit growth was also strong  resulting in higher temporary investments largely low yielding overnight federal funds sold to maintain liquidity especially during that last half of the year  this growth along with the impact of cash received from the july secondary offering reduced the improvement in the yield on earning assets in the fourth quarter versus the second quarter to basis points 
for all of  the average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points to 
interest expense totaled million in  an increase of million or 
the overall yield on interest bearing liabilities was  a decrease of basis points from the prior year 
combined now and money market rates were basis points lower on average  while the average cost of certificates of deposit declined basis points 
renewal of maturing certificates of deposit cd and expansion of cds outstanding at lower financial market rates resulted in an overall decrease in the average funding rate for the year 
the company s cost of funds began to rise coincident with the prime rate increases which started in july because of the maturity structure of the cds and the company s ability to lag increases in non maturity deposits  the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from second quarter to fourth quarter compared to the basis increase in average loan yield during the same period as noted above 
because of the improvement in overall earning asset yield was held to basis points  the net interest spread for fourth quarter was one basis point lower than in second quarter the net interest margin widened because the cash provided by the july secondary offering decreased the ratio of interest bearing liabilities to earning assets from to 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased by or  in to million 
fees earned by the bank of florida trust company climbed to million based on growth in assets under advice of 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to  indicative of growth in demand deposits in both the naples and ft 
lauderdale banks and the early impact of expansion into the palm beach and tampa bay markets 
these improvements were slightly offset by a reduction in fees from the origination and sale of mortgages in the secondary market from the prior year to  turnover of mortgage originators and reduced mortgage refinancing due to the upturn in financial market rates explain the reduction 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million in  a million or increase from the prior year 
the primary source of the increase million  including the termination of the horizon agreement related to holding company expansion  consistent with providing additional cost effective services to the company s subsidiaries 
holding company expense  net of intercompany eliminations  increased as resources began to be added to provide comprehensive and more cost effective services to the subsidiary banks than they could afford on their own 
a significantly greater share of executive management s efforts has been directed towards acquisitions  capital raising activities  and overall risk management  with higher on staff accounting and finance expertise as well as greater outside auditing  legal and consulting fees 
of the overall million increase in noninterest expense  million reflects costs related to establishing our palm beach county and tampa bay operations and a loss taken on terminating the proposed merger with horizon financial corp

included in general operating expenses are professional and outside services  data processing costs and the write off of deferred expense related to the termination of the horizon agreement  which increased   and  respectively 
asset quality and provision for loan losses the company maintained asset quality at high levels as measured by low nonperforming loans of loans outstanding or  strong coverage of the loan loss allowance to nonperforming loans times  minimal past due loans days at of loans outstanding  and very manageable net charge offs of  for the entire year or of average loans 
the most recently available data for national peer banks 
table of contents through september  had ratios of   and 
as of december   nonperforming loans days past due and nonaccruals totaled  or of loans outstanding 
net charge offs for were  or of average loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  amounted to million or of outstanding gross loans compared to million or of loans outstanding one year earlier 
because of the company s lack of historical loss experience  the allowance has been established based principally on loss histories of comparably sized and positioned banking institutions  adjusted for current economic and demographic conditions 
the allowance is also influenced by the fact that some of the loan portfolio at december  is related to residential real estate  which historically has resulted in a lower percentage of losses 
the loan loss provision was million in  higher than the expense in  largely because of strong loan growth of during the year

as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures  though such expenditures may be incurred in related to utilization of additional space at the company s headquarters location in naples 

table of contents while it is anticipated that interest income will increase commensurate with interest expense upon the attraction of deposits  non interest expenses will generally be disproportionately higher until such time as the volume of deposits and interest earning assets generate net interest income and service fees sufficient to cover these costs 
management s philosophy in each instance of expansion is to attract deposit relationships through the offering of competitive rates  terms and service 
as it is the company s philosophy to consider the investment portfolio principally as a source of liquidity  deposit growth  except to the extent necessary to maintain such liquidity  is generally utilized to fund the higher yielding loan portfolio  particularly commercial and  to a lesser degree  consumer mortgage lending 
in addition  it is management s practice to maintain the company s well capitalized status in compliance with regulatory guidelines when planning its expansion activities 
consistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization  the company maintains high capital ratios 
regulatory agencies including the state of florida department of financial services  the fdic and the federal reserve system have approved guidelines for a risk based capital framework that makes capital requirements more sensitive to the risks germane to each individual institution 
the guidelines require that total capital of be held against total risk adjusted assets 
at december   the company s tier capital ratio was  total risk based capital ratio was  and the tier leverage ratio was 
the company s ability to satisfy demands for credit  deposit withdrawals and other corporate needs depends on its level of liquidity 
the company utilizes several means to manage its liquidity 
one of the tools that the company uses to measure liquidity is a comparison of total liquid assets cash  due from banks  federal funds sold  and other investments to total deposits  calculating it on a daily basis and reviewing it monthly with the subsidiary bank management and board of director asset liability management committees alco 
as of december   consolidated company liquid assets were million or of consolidated deposits 
it is the policy of the banks to manage the latter ratio between and 
traditionally  increases in deposits are sufficient to provide adequate levels of liquidity  however  if needed  the company has approved extensions of credit available from correspondent banks amounting to million  sources for loan sales  and primarily short term investments that could be liquidated if necessary 
in addition  two of the company s banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank and  subject to certain collateral verification requirements  bank of florida southwest and bank of florida in ft 
lauderdale may borrow up to and  respectively  of their outstanding assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit gathering activities 
the measure of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
the company does not engage in trading or hedging activities and has not invested in interest rate derivatives or entered into interest rate swaps 
bancshares primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while adjusting its asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which reflects changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note fair values of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset liability management it is the objective of the company to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory  consistent level of profitability within the framework of established cash  loan  investment  borrowing and capital policies 
certain of the officers of the banks are responsible for monitoring policies and procedures that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of the asset liability mix  stability and leverage of all sources of funds while adhering to prudent banking practices 
it is the overall philosophy of management to support asset growth primarily through growth of core deposits  which include deposits of all categories made by individuals  partnerships and corporations 
management of the company seeks to invest the largest portion of its assets in commercial  consumer and real estate loans 

table of contents the asset liability mix is monitored on a monthly basis and a monthly report reflecting interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is prepared and presented to the respective banks boards of directors 
the objective of this policy is to control interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on the banks earnings 
interest sensitivity the objective of interest sensitivity management is to minimize the risk associated with the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels 
managing this risk involves monthly monitoring of the interest sensitive assets relative to interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
all assets and liabilities are evaluated as maturing at the earlier of re pricing date or contractual maturity date 
while liabilities without specific terms such as money market  now and savings accounts are generally considered core deposits for liquidity purposes  are deemed to re price for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis within the first twelve months 
management subjectively sets rates on all accounts 
the principal measure of our exposure to interest rate risk is the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities for the periods being measured  commonly referred to as gap for such period 
a positive gap position represents a greater amount of interest sensitive assets re pricing or maturing 
thus  an increase in rates would positively impact net interest income  as the yield on interest earning assets would increase prior to the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  a negative gap position is indicative of a bank that has a greater amount of interest sensitive liabilities re pricing or maturing than it does interest sensitive assets  in a given time interval 
in this instance  the impact on net interest income would be positive in a declining rate environment and negative if rates were rising 
the impact on net interest income described above is general  as other factors would additionally maximize or minimize the effect 
for example  a change in the prime interest rate could effect an immediate change to rates on prime related assets  whereas a liability which re prices according to changes in treasury rates might lag in the timing of the change and change rates in an amount less than the change in the prime interest rate 
it is common to focus on the one year gap  which is the difference between the dollar amount of assets and the dollar amount of liabilities maturing or repricing within the next twelve months 
the following is a consolidated maturity and re pricing analysis of rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  days days days over year total in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold interest bearing deposits investment securities restricted securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing demand deposits savings certificates of deposit other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap sensitive assets less rate sensitive liabilities cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap ratio as a percent of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio as a percent of total assets 
table of contents at december   the company had million in interest sensitive assets compared to million in interest sensitive liabilities that will mature or re price within a year  resulting in a positive gap position of million or  expressed as a percentage of total assets 
management believes that the current balance sheet structure of interest sensitive assets and liabilities does not represent a material risk to earnings or liquidity in the event of a change in market rates
