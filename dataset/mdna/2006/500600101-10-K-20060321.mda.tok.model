item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investment valuations  recoverability of deferred tax assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the price to the buyer charged for products delivered and services rendered and collectibility of the sales price 
we do not recognize revenue for products prior to customer acceptance unless we believe the product meets all customer specifications and has a history of consistently achieving customer acceptance of the product 
provisions for product returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenues 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of product when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances 
certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products 
sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors customers and not for stocking of inventory 
we delay revenue recognition for our estimate of distributor claims of right of return on unsold products based upon our historical experience with our products and specific analysis of amounts subject to return based upon discussions with our distributors or their customers 
we recognize revenues from long term research and development contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to amounts earned under milestones included in contracts  if such provisions exist 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as billings in excess of revenues earned 
we invoice based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
if our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make future payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans 
inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved as such information becomes available 
our iii v products are made to each customer s unique specifications and are generally produced upon receipt of a customer order 
the manufacturing time to make our iii v products is less than one day  accordingly our iii v inventory consists primarily of raw material  primarily gallium arsenide wafers  or finished products 
the finished product may be at our facilities or at our customer s facilities under consignment programs 
our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non binding demand forecasts provided by our customers  lead times for raw materials  lead times for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields 
if a customer were to cancel an order  or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand  we could not sell the excess iii v inventory and we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required 
if we were unable to sell the excess inventory we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value generally zero 
investment valuation we hold a minority investment in micrel  incorporated  a publicly traded company whose share prices may be highly volatile 
we consider this investment to be available for sale and accordingly account for fluctuations in the value of this investment in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if  however  we were to determine that the fair value of this investment had been other than temporarily impaired  we would be required to charge the loss directly to the statement of operations 
this investment had a fair market value of million at december   which was in excess of our carrying value at that date 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically make equity investments in private companies  accounted for on the cost or equity method  whose values are difficult to determine 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the amortization or depreciation period may need to be changed 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such asset are less than its carrying value 
for assets that are to be held and used  impairment is measured based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
if our estimates of anticipated future cash flows or market conditions were incorrect  additional impairment charges may be required 
during fiscal years and  we recognized a million and million  respectively  impairment charges related to assets held for use or being transferred to the kobrite joint venture and long lived assets supporting the iii v business 
the carrying value of our long lived assets was million on december  product warranty we generally sell products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products 
we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we had a warranty reserve of  which represents the estimated liabilities for warranty claims in process  potential warranty issues customers have notified us about and an estimate based on historical failure rates 
for the fiscal years  and our warranty expense was approximately   and  respectively 
if our estimates for warranty claims are incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
income taxes our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities 
despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes  federal alternative minimum taxes or foreign tax that may be due 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we also establish valuation allowances when recovery of such net deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than not 
these judgments consider our historical results and forecasts of future results 
because of our history of operating losses  our net operating loss carryforwards have had a full valuation allowance associated with them 
results of operations we are a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and miniature displays 
we use our proprietary semiconductor material technology to design  manufacture and market our iii v and cyberdisplay products for use in highly demanding commercial wireless communications and high resolution portable consumer electronic applications 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
in december  we adopted a fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december by amending our bylaws to change our year end 
the fiscal year ended december  includes weeks and the fiscal years ended december  and december  each include weeks 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  are referred to as fiscal years  and  respectively  herein 
the change in fiscal year was made to better match our production and shipping cycle  which is organized on a weekly basis 
we have two principal sources of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
product revenues consist of sales of our iii v products  principally gallium arsenide gaas hbt transistor wafers  and cyberdisplay products 
research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies of the us government 
research and development revenues were million  or of total revenues  million  or of total revenues in  and million  or of total revenues in in the fourth quarter of we entered into a joint venture  kobrite corp kobrite  with a taiwanese based light emitting diode led manufacturer  kopin taiwan corporation a taiwanese based iii v manufacturer  and financial investors  in which we agreed to transfer our cyberlite led technology and production know how and million of cash for a interest in kobrite 
subsequent to its formation  kobrite entered into agreements with us to purchase certain equipment and have us perform research and training activities with kobrite employees until kobrite s facilities were constructed and ready to receive the equipment 
under the agreements kobrite agreed to pay us an estimated net million for the equipment and million research and training activities and reimbursement for costs incurred in the transfer of the equipment 
through december  we had received the million for the equipment and approximately million for the research and training activities 
we have discontinued manufacturing and development efforts for cyberlite leds 
we retain the right to market kobrite s leds in the united states and to certain japanese customers 
for the fiscal years  and our cyberlite led sales were million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues for fiscal years and were as follows revenues iii v cyberdisplays total the increase in iii v revenues resulted from an increase in demand for our hbt transistor wafers from customers that use them in wireless handset applications 
the increase in demand for our hbt transistor wafers was offset by a reduction in our cyberlite revenues  which were million and million  respectively  for the years ended and  respectively 
the decrease in display revenues  which include both product and research and development contract revenue  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from a decline in sales of our cyberdisplay products to customers that use them for camcorder applications partially offset by an increase in military application sales 
based on current negotiations with our customers and certain contractual obligations  we expect the prices of certain of our products to decline in fiscal year we anticipate the average selling price of our hbt transistor wafers will decline approximately to during fiscal year the overall increase or decrease in the average sales price of our display will be dependent on the sales mix of commercial and military display sales 
in fiscal year  we expect the sale prices of our commercial displays to decline but we expect an increase in military product sales  which have higher unit selling prices 
discussions with our commercial display customers indicate that our competitors are offering price reductions for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in the range of to 
for the first quarter of fiscal we expect revenue to be in the range of million to million as a result of customary seasonality in our end markets and our transition away from some camcorder viewfinder business 
we believe we have captured significant share in the markets of the applications that currently use hbt transistor wafers  principally wireless handsets 
in order for us to generate revenue growth in this product line we will need the overall wireless handset market to increase  an increase in sales to customers who currently produce hbt transistor wafers internally or increased sales to other applications such as wifi 
we believe the sales of our cyberdisplay product to customers who use them for camcorder applications will decline in  because the camcorder product category is declining as new technologies  particularly digital video recorders  which do not use electronic viewfinders enter the market but more importantly because of the pricing pressures 
many of our competitors are significantly reducing their pricing and being very aggressive in bidding on new business 
the camcorder market is mature and uses low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors 
accordingly  for us to generate display revenues  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories such as eyewear 
international sales represented  and of revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to increase in domestic sales of our hbt products and military sales of our display products and a decrease in our international cyberdisplay sales for camcorder applications and our cyberlite led sales 
international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan  korea and china and cyberlite led sales to japan 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon s local operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
kowon also holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the historically stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of approximately million or 
cost of product revenues as a percent of sales for fiscal year and fiscal year was and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product sales primarily resulted from an improvement in manufacturing yields  a reduction in cost of sales of our optical product line as a result of the transfer of the optical assets to the kobrite joint venture  lower costs for certain raw materials  and million from the sale of inventory previously written off 
yield improvements were driven by improved efficiencies from higher volumes and favorable sales mix 
cost of sales of cyberlite products for fiscal year was million versus million for fiscal year the decrease was due to the sale of certain cyberlite led assets to the kobrite joint venture and the discontinuation of the use of the remaining cyberlite led assets  including equipment 
gross margin percentage was further increased because of higher military sales  which have higher margins  a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million 
research and development 
research and development expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government and commercial partners 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
funded research and development expenses were million in fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million 
the increase resulted primarily from contracts with the us military to support advanced multi spectral imaging displays 
internal research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in internal research and development expenses was primarily attributed to the lower development cost for our cyberlite products offset by development efforts for iii v and display products 
during fiscal year and we spent approximately million and million  respectively  including allocated overhead  on cyberlite led research and development costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
s  g a expenses were million in fiscal year and million for fiscal year the increase in s  g a expenses is attributable to an increase of approximately million of deferred stock compensation associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards  million for professional fees and million for reimbursement to kobrite for equipment damaged in transit to kobrite facilities 
further affecting the comparison between and was that in we recorded a credit of million to bad debt expense as a result of improved credit profile of our receivables 
in fiscal years and  we issued  and  restricted stock awards  respectively  to certain of our employees 
each award requires the employee to fulfill certain obligations including continued employment with us for periods of either two or four years the restriction period 
in connection with the issuance of the awards we recorded deferred compensation expenses of million and million for and  respectively  which are amortized over the restriction period  or earlier if the vesting accelerates due to meeting performance conditions 
included in s  g a expenses for fiscal year and was non cash amortization expense of million and million  respectively 
other 
other expenses  primarily amortization of patents and licenses  were for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year impairment charge 
in connection with the kobrite joint venture agreement discussed above  we entered into an agreement to transfer certain assets of its cyberlite led product line and discontinued the use of the remaining cyberlite led product line assets 
as a result of these actions we recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reduce the equipment to its estimated fair value of million 
in addition  because the cyberlite led product line assets were operated in a facility with some of the hbt transistor product line assets  the facility assets primarily leasehold improvements were grouped with all hbt product line assets and evaluated for future recovery based on the cash flows anticipated to be generated by the hbt product line assets 
based on this evaluation we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the hbt product line assets to their estimated fair value 
the million equipment write down and the million impairment charge are shown as a million impairment charge in the statement of operations 
in fiscal year  as part of discontinuing our cyberlite led product line  we terminated the employment of approximately employees and also recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
other income and expense  net 
other income and expense  net was income of million for fiscal year compared to income of million for other income and expense  net includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of foreign exchange losses and million of miscellaneous bank fees and other expense for fiscal year for fiscal year other income and expense  net also includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of foreign exchange losses and million of miscellaneous bank fees and other expense 
equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of the losses of kobrite totaling million in and our share of the losses of kopin taiwan corporation of million in and million in cumulative effect of accounting change 
as of december  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 

this interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an assets retirement when the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the impact of adopting fin was to record a cumulative effect of accounting change charge of million to recognize the accumulated depreciation as of the date of adoption related to the obligation for restoration of facilities leased by the company 
total obligations as of december  are estimated to be million 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our total revenues for fiscal years and were as follows revenues iii v cyberdisplays total the increase in iii v sales resulted from having a sole source agreement to provide hbt transistors to our largest customer in place for the entire fiscal year  compared to only a portion of fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal year  sales of our hbt transistors were lower than a typical quarter while we negotiated the sole source supply agreement 
the increase in display revenues  which include both product and research and development contract revenue  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from the initial sales of our display products into the digital still camera and thermal weapon sight markets 
for the fiscal years and cyberlite product sales  which are included within our iii v product group revenues  were approximately million and million  respectively 
international sales represented  and of revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to increase in domestic sales of our hbt products and military sales of our display products and a decrease in our international cyberlite led sales 
international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan and korea and cyberlite led sales to japan 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of approximately million or 
cost of product revenues as a percent of sales for fiscal year and fiscal year was and  respectively 
the increase in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product sales primarily resulted from an under utilization of cyberlite led manufacturing capacity  an initial lower yield of new color products as compared to the historical yield of our monochrome products and declining sales prices 
during fiscal year we did not sell a sufficient number of cyberlite led s for the cyberlite led product line to have a positive gross margin 
research and development 
research and development expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government and commercial partners 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
funded research and development expenses were million in fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million 
internal research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year internal research and development expenses were primarily attributed to the development of our new iii v products  cyberlite led s and color filter displays 
during fiscal year we spent approximately million  including allocated overhead  on cyberlite led research and development costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
s  g a expenses were million in fiscal year and million for fiscal year although fiscal year s  g a expense is the same amount as fiscal year  in fiscal year professional fees increased million resulting from the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of  and a non cash deferred compensation expense of million was recorded  which were offset by a reduction in bad debt allowances of approximately million 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal year  we increased our investment in kowon  our korean subsidiary  by acquiring an additional ownership for million 
we determined that million of the million represented compensation expense to previous management owners of the equity interest and it was expensed in s  g a 
in fiscal year  we issued  restricted stock awards to certain of our employees 
each award requires the employee to fulfill certain obligations including continued employment with us for periods of either two or four years the restriction period 
in connection with the issuance of the awards we recorded a deferred compensation expense of  which is amortized over the restriction period 
included in s  g a expenses for the fiscal year was non cash amortization expense of  other 
other expenses  primarily amortization of patents and licenses  were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year impairment charge 
in connection with the kobrite joint venture agreement discussed above  we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of its cyberlite led product line and discontinued the use of the remaining cyberlite led product line assets 
as a result of these actions we recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reduce the equipment to its estimated fair value of million 
in addition  because the cyberlite led product line assets were operated in a facility with some of the hbt transistor product line assets  the facility assets primarily leasehold improvements were grouped with all hbt product line assets and evaluated for future recovery based on the cash flows anticipated to be generated by the hbt product line assets 
based on this evaluation we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the hbt product line assets to their estimated fair value 
the million equipment write down and the million impairment charge are shown as a million impairment charge in the statement of operations 
other income and expense  net 
other income and expense  net was income of million for fiscal year compared to income of million for in  we exchanged our interest in kendin communications  inc kendin for approximately million shares of micrel incorporated micrel as part of micrel s acquisition of kendin 
we have accounted for our investment in micrel as available for sale securities since the receipt of micrel shares 
during the third quarter of fiscal year we sold  shares of micrel and recorded a gain of approximately million 
since the receipt of the micrel shares we have sold approximately  shares for total proceeds of million 
as of december  we held approximately  shares of micrel common stock  valued at million 
other income and expense  net also includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of foreign exchange losses and million of miscellaneous bank fees and other expense for fiscal year for fiscal year other income and expense  net also includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of foreign exchange losses and  of miscellaneous bank fees and other expense 
equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of the us gaap losses of kopin taiwan corporation of million in and million in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our equity securities  research and development contract revenues  and sales of our iii v and cyberdisplay products 
in november we filed a registration statement using a shelf registration process that we may  from time to time  offer shares of common stock or debt securities  the aggregate total of which will not exceed million 
as of december  we had issued  shares of our common stock for million and reduced the amount available for issuance under the registration statement to million 
we believe our available cash resources  exclusive of any drawdown on the aforementioned shelf registration statement  will support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
as of december   we had cash and equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the increase in cash and equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  offset by capital expenditures of million  an investment in kobrite of million and repurchases of our common stock of approximately million 
in december we amended a purchase and supply agreement with a significant hbt customer that now expires in july  excluding a last time buy option contained in the agreement 
under the terms of this agreement we have agreed to maintain capacity levels for manufacturing hbt wafers and we committed to a pricing schedule under certain circumstances 
the agreement also requires us to give prior notice if we exit our hbt product line 
in consideration for this agreement the customer agreed to source of its hbt wafer needs from us subject to the customer s right to source hbt wafers from other sources if we are unable to meet their requirements under certain circumstances 
we agreed that failure to meet our supply obligations under the agreement would allow our customer to obtain court ordered specific performance and if we do not perform we could then be liable for monetary damages up to a maximum of million 
we lease facilities located in taunton and westborough  massachusetts  and scotts valley  california  under non cancelable operating leases 
we have two taunton facilities  one whose lease expires in and the other in the taunton lease which expires in may be extended for one year term and the lease which expires in may be extended twice for individual year terms 
the westborough lease expires in april the scotts valley lease expires in we expect to expend between and million on capital expenditures over the next twelve months  primarily for the acquisition of equipment relating to the production of our cyberdisplay products 
on october   we authorized the re purchase of up to million of our common stock over a two year period 
through september  we repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program for  an average of per share 
subsequently our board of directors authorized an extension of this stock repurchase program for up to  of our common stock 
for the period september  through december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for  an average of per share 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice upon approval of our board of directors 
as of december   we had substantial tax loss carry forwards  which may be used to offset future federal taxable income 
we may be subject to alternative minimum taxes  foreign taxes and state income taxes depending on our taxable income and sources of taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the recognition of compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
the standard is effective beginning with a company s first fiscal year on or after june  the company is required to adopt sfas r on january   and anticipates using the modified prospective application method  although the company continues to review its options for adoption under this pronouncement 
the company currently estimates the additional stock option expenses that will be recognized for the options unvested as of december  will be in the range of million to million in fiscal the compensation amount may increase if we issue additional awards 
the compensation cost for our unvested stock is expected to be comparable to our current accounting policies 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the markets we sell into are traditionally seasonal and we would expect that as our business matures  our third quarter would be our strongest sales quarter followed by our second quarter then our fourth quarter and our first quarter would be our lowest sales quarter 
fiscal year did not follow this pattern as our third quarter was impacted by a decline in demand from a large hbt customer 
in the third quarter of fiscal year we negotiated a new supply agreement with this customer whereby it would source of its hbt requirements from us 
in conjunction with this agreement the hbt customer consumed its remaining inventory of hbt product  which it had previously purchased from other vendors  which lowered its demand for our hbt product in the third quarter of fiscal year inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflationary forces 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual payment obligations for operating leases as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in high quality government  government backed and corporate debt instruments  which bear lower levels of relative risk 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material to our cash flows or income 
it is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrecognized gain or loss on interest rate securities 
included in other assets is an equity investment in micrel  incorporated micrel totaling approximately million which is subject to changes in value because of either specific operating issues at micrel or overall changes in the stock market 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiary s financial position  results of operations  and transaction gains and losses as a result of non us dollar denominated cashflows related to business activities in asia  and remeasurement of united states dollars to the functional currency of our kowon subsidiary 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk
