item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the results of operations  capital resources and liquidity presented in its accompanying consolidated financial statements for harleysville national corporation the corporation  and its wholly owned subsidiaries harleysville national bank the bank  hnc financial company and hnc reinsurance company 
the corporation s consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
current performance does not guarantee  and may not be indicative of  similar performance in the future 
the information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the corporation s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes under item of this report on form k 
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the corporation and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices with the financial services industry 
the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements and are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
in applying accounting policies and preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenditures for the periods presented 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
judgments and assumptions required by management  which have  or could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations are considered critical accounting estimates 
the following is a summary of the policies the corporation recognizes as involving critical accounting estimates allowance for loan loss  goodwill and other intangible asset impairment  stock based compensation  unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale  and deferred taxes 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including current and anticipated economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  borrowers perceived financial and management strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  the dependence on collateral  or the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required which may adversely affect the corporation s results of operations in the future 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the corporation employs general industry practices in evaluating the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the corporation calculates the fair value using a combination of the following valuations deposit premiums based on market deals  current stock pricing tracking as a multiple of book value  discounted cash flow of earnings with a terminal value and market multiple of earnings 
management performed its annual review of goodwill at june  in accordance with sfas no 
and determined there was no impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
no assurance can be given that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
stock based compensation under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas  companies have a choice whether to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation or remain with the intrinsic value based method prescribed under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb but provide pro forma disclosure as if the fair value based method was applied 
the corporation chose the intrinsic value based method under apb and provides pro forma disclosure required under fas in preparing the pro forma disclosure  the corporation estimates the fair value of employee stock options using a pricing model which takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk free interest rate for the expected life of the option 
the corporation s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
under fas r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  will be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement 
registrants are required to implement fas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year that begins after june   per the securities and exchange commission s rule issued in april amending the fas r compliance date 
the corporation has adopted sfas r on january  the corporation will use the modified prospective application method of transition 
effective january   the corporation will recognize compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards at january  for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
for new grants awarded on or after january   the corporation has chosen to continue the use of the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant 
in accordance with sfas r  the corporation will estimate the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered as compared to accounting for forfeitures as they occur under sfas the corporation has chosen to recognize compensation expense for new grants using the straight line method which spreads compensation expense for shares vesting evenly over the period of vesting 
proforma disclosures under sfas have been based upon the accrual method which treats each vesting tranche as a separate award and amortizes expense evenly prorated from grant date to vest date for each tranche 
the corporation estimates that share based compensation expense  net of tax  to be recognized during the year of will be approximately  the number and timing of options granted during and vesting criteria may alter this projected number 
unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers 
in developing these fair values  the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments 
debt securities available for sale are mostly comprised of mortgage backed securities 
deferred taxes the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realizations are likely 
if management determines that the corporation may not be able to realize some or all of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable value 
the corporation has not substantively changed its application of the foregoing policies  and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques used as compared to prior periods

investment securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that debt and equity securities classified as available for sale be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the net effect of unrealized gains or losses  caused by marking an available for sale portfolio to market  causes fluctuations in the level of shareholders equity and equity related financial ratios as market interest rates cause the fair value of fixed rate securities to fluctuate 
investment securities decreased to million at december  from million at december  the investment securities available for sale decreased million and the investment securities held to maturity decreased million 
during  million of securities available for sale were sold which generated a pretax gain of million 
the securities sold consisted primarily of tax exempt bonds  trust preferred bonds and equity securities 
in comparison  billion of securities available for sale were sold in which generated a pretax gain of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation transferred million of obligations of states and political subdivisions from available for sale to held to maturity 
the bank intends to hold these securities to maturity as these securities are an effective tool to lower the corporation s effective tax rate 
the corporation sells investment securities available for sale to fund the purchase of other securities in an effort to enhance the overall return of the portfolio and to reduce the interest rate risk within different interest rate environments

loans loans increased million  or in  primarily attributed to growth in commercial real estate loans and home equity loans 
the growth in real estate loans was due to the bank s strategy of growing real estate loans in its primary market 
one of the bank s strategic objectives is to increase its loan to deposit ratio by growing its loan portfolio at a faster pace than its deposits 
the planned reduction in lease financing was due to run off and sales 
loans increased million  or in  primarily due to growth in real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit along with million in loans acquired in the acquisition of millennium bank 
the following table shows the composition of the bank s loans table composition of loan portfolio december  amount percent of loans amount percent of loans amount percent of loans amount percent of loans amount percent of loans dollars in thousands real estate commercial and industrial consumer lease financing total the following table details outstanding loans by type as of december   in terms of contractual maturity date table selected loan maturity data december  due in year or less due after year through years due after years total dollars in thousands real estate commercial and industrial consumer lease financing total loans with variable or floating interest rates loans with fixed predetermined interest rates total the following table details those loans that were placed on nonaccrual status  or were delinquent by days or more and still accruing interest table nonaccrual loans and loans days or more past due accruing interest december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans loans days or more past due accruing interest total the bank had no concentration of loans to individual borrowers which exceeded of total loans at december  and the bank actively monitors the risk of this loan concentration 
the bank had no foreign loans  and the impact of nonaccrual and delinquent loans on total interest income was not material 
a loan is generally classified as nonaccrual when principal or interest has consistently been in default for a period of days or more  when there has been deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  or payment in full of principal or interest is not expected 
delinquent loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are loans that are generally well secured and expected to be restored to a current status in the near future 
nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans  net assets in foreclosure and loans days or more past due was 
of total assets at december   compared to at december  and at december  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total net loans was at december   compared to at december  and at december  nonaccruing loans increased million to million at december   as compared to december  the increase was primarily due to commercial mortgage loans for one borrower totaling million and commercial business loans for four borrowers totaling million which were placed on nonaccrual of interest 
nonaccruing loans increased million to million at december   in comparison to december  the increase in nonaccruing loans was primarily the result of increases in nonaccruing commercial real estate loans of million and commercial and industrial loans of  partially offset by decreases in nonaccruing residential real estate loans of  the increase in nonaccruing commercial real estate consists primarily of two loans to one borrower in the amount of million 
the bank s policy for interest income recognition on nonaccrual loans is to recognize income under the cash basis when the loans are both current and the collateral on the loan is sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation to the bank 
the bank will not recognize income if these factors do not exist 
during  interest accrued on nonaccruing loans and not recognized as interest income was  and interest paid on nonaccruing loans of  was recognized as interest income

foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost lesser of carrying value of the asset or fair value at date of acquisition or estimated fair value 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are loans that are generally well secured and are in the process of collection 
as of december   loans past due days or more and still accruing interest were  compared to  at december  and million at december  the bank uses the reserve method of accounting for loan losses 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
increases to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses

increases to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on information currently available  future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses and management s intent with regard to the disposition of loans 
in addition  the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically reviews the bank s allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank s allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on various independent methodologies 
the components of the allowance for credit losses consists of both historical losses and estimates 
management bases its recognition and estimation of each allowance component on certain observable data that it believes is the most reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated 
the observable data and accompanying analysis is directionally consistent  based upon trends  with the resulting component amount for the allowance for loan losses 
the bank s allowance for loan losses components includes the following historical loss estimation by loan product type and by risk rating within each product type  payment past due status  industry concentrations  internal and external variables such as economic conditions  credit policy and underwriting changes and competence of the loan review process 
the bank s historical loss component is the most significant component of the allowance for loan losses  and all other allowance components are based on the inherent loss attributes that management believes exist within the total portfolio that are not captured in the historical loss component 
the historical loss components of the allowance represent the results of analysis of historical charge offs and recoveries within pools of homogeneous loans  within each risk rating and broken down further by segment  within the portfolio 
criticized assets are further assessed based on trends  expressed as percentages  relative to delinquency  risk rating and non accrual  by credit product 
the historical loss components of the allowance for commercial loans are based principally on current risk ratings  historical loss rates adjusted  by adjusting the risk window  to reflect current events and conditions  as well as analysis of other factors that may have affected the collectibility of loans 
the bank analyzes all commercial loans that have been identified as having potential credit risk 
the review is accomplished via watchlist memorandum  and is designed to determine whether such loans are individually impaired  with impairment measured by reference to the collateral coverage and or debt service coverage 
the historical loss component of the allowance for consumer loans is based principally on loan payment status  retail classification and historical loss rates  adjusted by altering the risk window  to reflect current events and conditions 
the industry concentration component is recognized as a possible factor in the estimation of loan losses 
two industries represent possible concentrations commercial real estate and consumer loans relying on residential home equity 
no specific loss related observable data is recognized by management currently  therefore no specific factor is calculated in the reserve solely for the impact of these concentrations  although management continues to carefully consider relevant data for possible future sources of observable data 
the historic loss model includes a judgmental component environmental factors that reflects management s belief that there are additional inherent credit losses based on loss attributes not adequately captured in the lagging indicators 
furthermore  given that past performance indicators may not adequately capture current risk levels  allowing for a real time adjustment enhances the validity of the loss recognition process 
there are many credit risk management reports that are synthesized by credit management staff to assess the direction of credit risk and its instant effect on losses 
it is important to continue to use experiential data to confirm risk as measurable losses will continue to manifest themselves at higher than normal levels even after the economic cycle has begun an upward swing and lagging indicators begin to show improvement 
the judgmental component is allocated to the specific segments of the portfolio based on the historic loss component 
deposits and borrowings deposits and borrowings are the primary funding sources of the corporation 
core deposits increased or million  to billion at december   up from billion at december  total deposits increased million  or for the same period  which was primarily attributable to the growth in core deposit checking products and time deposits of  or greater 
the corporation has placed more emphasis on government banking to provide additional funding sources through relationships with municipalities and school districts resulting in both interest bearing checking accounts and large time deposits

each of these major elements is reviewed in more detail in the following discussion 
net interest income net interest income on a tax equivalent basis in increased  or to million  compared to the increase in was mostly due to higher loan volume  partially offset by higher deposit rates 
as a result of market conditions  deposit rates have increased more quickly than the loan rates have increased 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis in increased million  or to million in comparison to the increase in was primarily the result of loan growth partially offset by lower loan rates and a higher level of borrowings 
the lower loan rates were largely attributable to the general decline in market interest rates

nonaccrual loans have been included in the appropriate average loan balance category  but interest on nonaccrual loans has not been included for purposes of determining interest income 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis in increased million  or to million  compared to this increase was mainly due to higher average loans of million  or and a basis point rise in the average rates earned on loans 
interest expense increased million  to million during mostly attributed to higher deposit and borrowing rates 
the average rate paid on deposits during of was basis points higher compared to primarily due to higher rates on money market accounts  interest checking accounts and time deposits accounts of  or more 
these higher rates resulted from the increase in short term rates during the average rate paid on borrowings for of was basis points higher than mainly due to an increase in short term borrowing rates 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis in increased million  or to million as compared to this increase was mainly due to an increase in average loans of million  or partially offset by a basis point reduction in the average rates earned on loans 
loans totaling million were acquired in the acquisition of millennium bank which contributed to the increase in average loans 
interest expense increased million  or to million during primarily due to a higher level of borrowings 
average borrowings increased million  or during to support loan growth and the millennium bank acquisition 
net interest margin the net interest margin of was lower than the net interest margins for and of and  respectively 
the decline in the net interest margin from is primarily due to higher funding costs  particularly in money market deposit accounts and short term borrowings 
as a result of market conditions  deposit rates have increased more quickly than the loan rates have increased  although net interest income has increased primarily as a result of higher earning assets volume 
the decline in the net interest margin in from was primarily due to a decline in loan yields impacted by the lower interest rate environment 
during  the corporation continued to manage its balance sheet in an effort to position it for potentially higher rates in the future 
the corporation continued to sell securities with longer average lives in a rising rate environment and purchased securities with more stable cash flows in such a rate environment 
as a result  the balance sheet is better positioned to minimize market risk from rising rates

nonaccrual loans have been included in the appropriate average loan balance category  but interest on nonaccrual loans has not been included for purposes of determining interest income 
interest rate sensitivity analysis in the normal course of conducting business activities  the corporation is exposed to market risk  principally interest rate risk  through the operations of its banking subsidiary 
interest rate risk arises from market driven fluctuations in interest rates that affect cash flows  income  expense and value of financial instruments 
the corporation actively manages its interest rate sensitivity positions 
the objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve consistent growth in net interest income 
the asset liability committee  using policies and procedures approved by the corporation s board of directors  is responsible for managing the rate sensitivity position 
the corporation manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix and repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities through the management of its investment securities portfolio  its offering of loan and deposit terms and through borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the nature of the corporation s current operations is such that it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the corporation only utilizes derivative instruments for asset liability management 
these transactions involve both credit and market risk 
the notional amounts are amounts on which calculations and payments are based 
the notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures 
direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid  if any 
interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest rate flows fixed and floating are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amounts on which the interest payments are based are not exchanged 
at december    the corporation had cash flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps with a notional value totaling million that have the effect of converting the rates on money market deposit accounts to a fixed rate cost of funds 
this strategy will cause the bank to recognize  in a rising rate environment  a larger interest rate spread than it otherwise would have without the swaps in effect 
for these swaps  the corporation recognized  of net interest income for the year ended december  and estimates that for   will be recognized as an increase in net interest income 
these swaps mature in during the first quarter of  the corporation terminated a cash flow hedge with a notional value of million 
the gross loss related to the termination of this swap is  which is being amortized through october in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for the year ended december   the corporation amortized into net interest income  related to this swap 
periodically  the corporation may enter into fair value hedges to limit the exposure to changes in the fair value of loan assets 
during december  the corporation entered into a fair value hedge for million which had no impact to earnings for this swap matures in at december   the interest rate swap agreements have a positive fair market value of  compared to  at december  the corporation uses three principal reports to measure interest rate risk asset liability simulation reports  gap analysis reports  and net interest margin reports 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  as measured by the repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december   is presented in table the data in the table was based in part on assumptions that are regularly reviewed for accuracy

management also simulates possible economic conditions and interest rate scenarios in order to quantify the impact on net interest income 
the effect that changing interest rates have on the corporation s net interest income is simulated by increasing and decreasing interest rates 
this simulation is known as rate shocking 
the results of the december  net interest income rate shock simulations show that the corporation is within guidelines set by the corporation s asset liability policy 
the following table forecasts changes in the corporation s market value of equity under alternative interest rate environments as of december  the market value of equity is defined as the net present value of the corporation s existing assets and liabilities 
the corporation is within guidelines set by the corporation s asset liability policy for the percentage change in the market value of equity

the corporation could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize growth in loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or attract deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses of million for reflected an increase of  compared to the provision of million 
the increase in the provision during was primarily due to inherent risk related to loan growth which totaled million and the increase in non performing loans of million 
total net loans charged off in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
noninterest income noninterest income of million for the year ended december  reflects an increase of million  or from the increase in noninterest income was attributed to gains of million on sales of investment securities and gains of  and  on the sales of harleysville national bank s mcadoo branch and cumberland advisors  inc  respectively  during the second quarter of the increase in net security gains in was primarily the result of sales of tax exempt  trust preferred and equity securities to position the balance sheet in the current interest rate environment

the sale price was million cash and resulted in a non taxable gain of  recorded in the second quarter of it was acquired by the corporation on april  as part of its millennium bank acquisition 
management does not believe the sale of cumberland advisors will have a material impact on the corporation s future results of operations 
noninterest income of million during increased  or  to million during  compared to this was mainly due to an increase of million in trust and investment advisory fees and an increase of million in the gains related to the auto leasing portfolio  partially offset by a decrease of million in the gain on sales of investment securities and a decrease of  in gains related to the sale of residential mortgages 
the increase in trust and investment advisory fees of million  or during  was primarily attributable to the cumberland subsidiary acquired with the millennium bank acquisition  growth in trust assets and the higher market value of equities in trust assets experienced in  compared to gains related to the auto leasing portfolio increased million during mostly due to residual insurance fund valuations

management is not aware of any recommendation by any regulatory authority  which  if it were to be implemented  would have a material effect on the corporation s capital 
pursuant to the federal regulators risk based capital adequacy guidelines  the components of capital are called tier and tier capital 
for the corporation  tier capital is shareholders equity and tier capital is the allowance for loan losses 
the risk based capital ratios are computed by dividing the components of capital by risk adjusted assets 
risk adjusted assets are determined by assigning credit risk weighting factors from to to various categories of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the minimum for the tier capital ratio is  and the total capital ratio tier plus tier capital divided by risk adjusted assets minimum is 
at december   the corporation s tier risk adjusted capital ratio was  and the total risk adjusted capital ratio was  both well above regulatory requirements 
the risk based capital ratios of the bank also exceeded regulatory requirements at the end of at december   the corporation s tier risk adjusted capital ratio was  and the total risk adjusted capital ratio was 
the higher risk based capital ratios of the corporation at december  compared to december  were primarily attributable to the increase in tier capital from the issuance of million of trust preferred securities during the third quarter of to supplement the risk based capital adequacy guidelines  the federal reserve board frb established a leverage ratio guideline 
the leverage ratio consists of tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets  excluding intangible assets 
the minimum leverage ratio guideline is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and that have well diversified risk  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings and  in general  are considered top rated  strong banking organizations 
other banking organizations are expected to have ratios of at least or  depending upon their particular condition and growth plans 
higher leverage ratios could be required by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
the corporation s leverage ratios were and at december  and  respectively 
the higher leverage ratio of the corporation at december  was mainly due to the increase in tier capital from the issuance of million of trust preferred securities during the third quarter of under fdic regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order 
to be considered adequately capitalized an institution must generally have a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
an institution is deemed to be critically under capitalized if it has a tangible equity ratio of or less 
as of december   the bank is above the regulatory minimum guidelines and meets the criteria to be categorized as a well capitalized institution 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of the ability of the bank to meet its needs and obligations on a timely basis 
for a bank  liquidity requires the ability to meet the day to day demands of deposit customers  and the ability to fulfill the needs of borrowing customers 
generally  the bank arranges its mix of cash  money market investments  investment securities and loans in order to match the volatility  seasonality  interest sensitivity and growth trends of its deposit funds 
the liquidity measurement is based on the asset liability model s projection of potential sources and uses of funds for the next days 
the resulting projections as of december   show the potential sources of funds exceeding the potential uses of funds 
the corporation has external sources of funds  which can be drawn upon when funds are required 
the primary source of external liquidity is an available line of credit with the fhlb of pittsburgh 
as of december   the bank had borrowings outstanding with the fhlb of million  all of which were long term and pledged investment securities available for sale of million 
at december   the bank had unused lines of credit at the fhlb of million and unused federal funds lines of credit with commercial banks of million 
there are no known trends or any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in  or that are reasonably likely to result in liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  table contractual obligations and other commitments december  total one year or less after one year through three years after three years through five years after five years dollars in thousands minimum annual operating leases remaining contractual maturities of time deposits long term borrowings and subordinated debt unfunded home equity lines of credit unfunded other loan lines of credit unfunded residential mortgages standby letters of credit total home equity lines of credit in the after five years category have no stated expiration 
the bank also had commitments with customers to extend mortgage loans at a specified rate at december  and of million and million  respectively and commitments to sell mortgage loans at a specified rate at december  and of million and million  respectively 
the commitments are accounted for as a derivative and recorded at fair value 
the bank estimates the fair value of these commitments by comparing the secondary market price at the reporting date to the price specified in the contract to extend or sell the loan initiated at the time of the loan commitment 
at december  and  the fair values of the loan commitments were and  respectively  which were recorded as other income 
during december and january  the bank sold lease financing receivables of million 
of these leases  million were sold with full recourse and the remaining leases were sold subject to recourse with a maximum exposure of ten percent of the outstanding receivable 
the total recourse exposure at the time of the sale of the leases was million 
during the first quarter of  the bank recorded a recourse liability of  which is the entire recourse liability recorded 
this estimate was based on our historic losses as experienced on similar lease financing receivables 
after the first anniversary of the sale agreement  and on a quarterly basis thereafter  upon written request by the bank  the purchaser will review the portfolio performance and may reduce the total exposure to an amount equal to ten percent of the outstanding net book value 
the corporation will be subject to the full and partial recourse obligations until all the lease financing receivables have been paid or otherwise been terminated and all equipment has been sold or disposed of 
the final lease payment is due in with approximately of the lease financing receivables estimated to be paid down by the outstanding balance of these sold leases at december  was million with a total recourse exposure of million
