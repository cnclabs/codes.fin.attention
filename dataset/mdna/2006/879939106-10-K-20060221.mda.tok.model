we grew in revenue and profitability from the company s founding through  primarily driven by increases in large  global client contracts 
although revenue growth continued from to  we began to experience operating losses beginning in  which continued through those losses were the result of the following factors  among others sales cycles increasing as a result of a global economic downturn  certain client contracts terminating or being scaled back resulting in excess cmc capacity  pricing and contract terms experiencing pressure as a result of the maturation of the customer management industry  international operations experiencing difficulties  including an unsuccessful acquisition in spain during  excess capacity in the united kingdom  and excess capacity coupled with certain unprofitable client programs in latin america  
table of contents decreased profitability of a large north american client program prior to transitioning the work to lower cost locations  and charges related to workforce reductions  asset impairments  and the closure of certain cmcs 
to address these circumstances  in mid we developed a business plan with the objective of returning operations to profitability 
under that plan  we have taken the following actions  among others  over the last two years appointed new operations and sales management teams  invested in our sales and account management teams  established product and sales teams to focus on the development of new products and services  expanded our lower cost  english speaking services in argentina  canada  india  mexico  and the philippines  transitioned certain client programs to lower cost locations to improve profitability  terminated client contracts that we determined could not be reasonably returned to our desired level of profitability  implemented a plan to improve workforce utilization and operational efficiencies  and reduced our global operating costs  including reducing our global workforce and general and administrative expenses 
the results of implementing those measures have been eight consecutive quarters of profitability  and a reduction in our total outstanding indebtedness of million since december  description of business we operate two distinct businesses customer management services and database marketing and consulting 
we further classify our customer management services into north american customer care providing customer management services to clients based in the united states us and international customer care consisting of clients in all other countries  resulting in three segments  which reflect our management of the company  our internal financial reporting  and our operating focus 
financial information about our segments and geographic locations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
customer management services our customer management services business manages customer interactions on behalf of our clients via multi channel cmcs throughout the world  using telephone  e mail  integrated voice response  and web based services 
approximately of our customer management services revenue comes from inbound customer interactions  and  therefore  the restrictions under the do not call registry do not have a material impact on our business 
our customer management services business includes customer acquisition services we provide new account services including processing and fulfilling pre sale information requests  verifying sales  activating services  and directing customers to product or service sources 
customer provisioning services we manage front and back office processes from order to installation 

table of contents customer support services we manage customer support interactions ranging from basic services such as billing support and account maintenance  to complex transactions such as insurance claims processing  technical support  and help desk support 
customer development services we assist our clients with identifying high value customers and seek to increase clients sales through up selling and cross selling their products and or services 
customer retention programs we work in conjunction with clients to develop targeted customer satisfaction and loyalty programs to help manage customer attrition and or turnover 
other customer related programs we assist our clients with account collections  collecting market research from customers  and performing outbound call campaigns 
many clients request a combination of the above services 
additionally  we work to develop new products and services to meet client needs  which we refer to as solutions 
we offer clients an alternative to using in house resources to manage customer relationships 
clients utilize our customer management experience  infrastructure  technology  and resources to increase their customer s satisfaction 
our core competencies include infrastructure deployment  including the development of data centers and cmcs  workforce development  including recruitment  education  and management of client dedicated customer service representatives csrs  process control implementation  including formulating and engineering quality control systems  technology consulting and implementation  including the integration of hardware  software  network  and computer telephony technology  and database management  including the accumulation  management  and analysis of customer information to aid in the development of marketing strategies 
we offer services under three programs  i fully outsourced  which are turnkey cmcs leased  equipped  and staffed by us  ii facilities management  which are cmcs owned or leased and equipped by our clients and staffed by us  and iii infrastructure outsourced  which are cmcs leased and equipped by us and staffed by our clients 
fully outsourced cmcs may be dedicated to a single client dedicated centers or serve multiple clients multi client centers 
as of december   and excluding cmcs we announced plans to exit see note to the consolidated financial statements  we had  workstations in cmcs  of which were dedicated centers  were multi client centers  and were managed centers representing   and  workstations of capacity  respectively 
markets and clients 
we focus on large global corporations in the following industries automotive  communications and media  financial services  government  healthcare  logistics  retail  technology  and travel 
the communications and media industry comprises approximately of our total revenue and represents the largest portion of our client programs 
we had two clients who individually represented more than of total revenue sprint nextel formerly nextel communications  inc  the company contracts with ibm  who contracts with sprint nextel and verizon communications verizon  which accounted for and of consolidated revenue  respectively 
certain of our communications clients  which represent approximately one third of our annual revenue  also provide to us telecommunication services 
we believe each of these supplier contracts is negotiated on an arms length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than one percent of total costs 
we also have a significant client relationship with ford motor company ford 
we provide customer management services to internal ford divisions and units 
this client relationship  established in the form of a 
table of contents joint venture named percepta  represented million of revenue 
we have a ownership interest in this venture 
at the onset of this relationship in  we issued stock purchase warrants to ford entitling ford to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share 
we valued these warrants  using the black scholes option model  at approximately million 
these warrants expired unexercised on december  also  the agreement provides that at any time after december   we have the right to require ford to purchase its interest in the operations at fair market value 
ford also has the right to require us to sell our interest in the operations at fair value to ford 
at december   the net book value of the operating assets and liabilities was million and for the year ended december   the income before taxes from this client relationship was million 
as discussed below  our database marketing and consulting business has a client relationship with ford that is unrelated to percepta 
sales and marketing 
we typically provide customer management services pursuant to written contracts with terms ranging from one to eight years and our contracts often contain renewal and or extension options 
under the majority of our significant contracts  we generate revenue based on the amount of time csrs devote to a client s program 
in addition  clients typically are required to pay fees relating to the implementation of the program including initial education and training of csrs  setup of the program  and development and integration of computer software and technology 
clients also may be required to pay fees relating to the management of the program and the recruiting  hiring  and training of new csrs to backfill vacant positions 
such fees may be billed as a separate charge upon commencement of the client relationship  or may be bundled into the recurring production rate billed to the client over the life of the contract 
contracts may  depending upon our assessment of the associated risks and opportunities  include provisions such as i performance based pricing provisions  whereby the client may pay more or we may have to issue a credit  depending upon our ability to meet agreed upon performance metrics  and ii a requirement for our clients to pay a fee in the event of early termination 
most contracts have price adjustment terms allowing for cost of living adjustments and or market changes in csr labor costs 
additionally  our client contracts generally contain provisions that designate the manner by which we receive payment for our services and allow us or the client to terminate the contract upon the occurrence of certain events 
we employ a team sales approach and seek to hire business development professionals with experience in our targeted industries in order to best negotiate these contracts to fulfill the company s goals 
operations 
we provide customer management services through operations located in the us  argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  india  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  the philippines  singapore  spain  the united kingdom  and venezuela 
we apply predetermined site selection criteria to identify locations conducive to operating cmcs in a cost effective manner 
we pursue local government incentives such as tax abatements  cash grants  low interest loans  training grants  and low cost utilities 
following site evaluations and cost analyses  as well as client considerations  a specific site is located and a lease is negotiated and finalized 
once we take occupancy of a site  we use a standardized development process designed to control development costs and to minimize the time it takes to open a new cmc 
the site is retrofitted to requirements that incorporate engineering  cost control  and scheduling concepts while placing emphasis on the quality of the work environment 
upon completion  we integrate the new cmc into our corporate real estate and asset management processes 
generally  we can establish a new  fully operational cmc within days after a lease is finalized and signed 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our centers 
accordingly  we may consolidate or close under performing centers  including those impacted by the loss of a major client program  in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and profit margins 
quality assurance 
we monitor and measure the quality and accuracy of our customer interactions through regional quality assurance departments 
these departments evaluate  on a real time basis  a certain percentage of the customer interactions during a day  across all of the customer interaction mediums utilized 
table of contents within the center 
using criteria mutually determined with the client  quality assurance professionals monitor  evaluate  and provide feedback to the csrs on a weekly basis 
as appropriate  representatives are recognized for superior performance or scheduled for additional training and coaching 
technology 
our technology platforms are designed to maximize the utilization of the cmcs and increase the efficiency of the csrs 
we use interaction routing technology designed to expedite response times  and workforce management systems designed to establish csr staffing levels that most efficiently meet call volume demands 
in addition  our technology platform allows for tracking of each customer interaction  filing the information within a relational database  and generating reports on demand so that both our clients and our internal operations teams can analyze the performance of the client program and gather information regarding customer behaviors 
we have invested in designing and developing industry specific  open systems software applications and tools and  as a result  maintain a library of reusable software code for use in future developments 
we run our application software on an open system  client server architecture and use a variety of products developed by third party vendors 
we continue to invest resources into the development and implementation of emerging customer management and technical support technologies 
human resources 
to sustain an adequate level of service and support for our clients customers  our csrs undergo training before managing customer interactions and for many client programs  receive ongoing training on a regular basis 
in addition to learning about the clients corporate culture and specific product or service offerings  csrs receive training in the numerous media we use to execute our clients customer management program 
we primarily employ full time csrs with competitive salaries and wages and a full range of employee benefits 
competition 
we compete primarily with the in house customer management operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide customer management services on an outsourced basis  including accenture  convergys corporation  eds  ibm  sitel corporation  and sykes enterprises incorporated  among others 
we may work with some of these companies on a sub contract basis 
we compete primarily on the basis of experience  global locations  quality and scope of services  speed and flexibility of implementation  technological expertise  price  and contractual terms 
a number of competitors may have greater capabilities and resources than ours 
additionally  niche providers or new entrants could capture a segment of the market by developing new systems or services that could impact our market potential

in february  we acquired an additional interest in the venture  bringing our total ownership interest to

in addition  ford will be offering a product that competes with our database marketing and consulting services 
as the trend toward dealership consolidation continues  dealerships may decide to create internal economies of scale  and could choose to satisfy their database management and direct marketing needs internally 
in addition  we compete with the in house database marketing and consulting services of our automotive dealership clients 
employees as of december   we had over  employees in countries 
approximately of these employees held full time positions 
our industry is labor intensive and traditionally experiences significant personnel turnover 
our employees in spain are subject to collective bargaining agreements mandated under national labor laws 
seasonality historically we have experienced a seasonal impact in the fourth quarter primarily related to higher volumes from a few clients with seasonality in their business  particularly the package delivery business 
also  we typically experience higher labor related costs primarily during the first quarter due to payroll taxes 
as discussed below  we earned a significant amount of revenue during the fourth quarter of from a short term us government program to provide disaster relief services related to hurricanes in the us although we have a multi year contract with the us general services administration  there can be no assurance that the need for such services in the future will arise or that we would be selected to provide such services

risk factors 
you should not construe the following cautionary statements as an exhaustive list 
we cannot always predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward looking statements 
all cautionary statements should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties  and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed herein might not occur 
forward looking information may prove to be inaccurate 
some of the information presented in this annual report on form k constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements that include terms such as may  will  intend  anticipate  estimate  expect  continue  believe  plan  or the like  as well as all statements that are not historical facts 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations 
although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations or have a material adverse effect upon our business include our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients 
we rely on strategic  long term relationships with large  global companies in targeted industries 
as a result  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients 
additionally  client consolidations could result in a loss of clients 
there can be no assurance that we will not become more dependent on a few significant clients  that we will be able to retain any of our largest clients  that the volumes or profit margins of our most significant programs will not be reduced  or that we would be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate comparable revenue and profits 
our business may be affected by the success of our clients 
in substantially all of our client programs  we generate revenue based  in large part  on the amount of time our csrs devote to our clients customers 
consequently  the amount of revenue generated from any particular client program is dependent upon consumers interest in  and use of  the client s products and or services 
there can be no assurance that our clients will continue to market products and services or develop new products and services that require them to use our services 
our financial results may be adversely impacted by the global economy 
our ability to enter into new multi year contracts with large clients may be impacted by the general macroeconomic environment in which our clients and their customers operate 
weakening economic conditions  both global and local in nature  could result in increased sales cycles  delays in finalizing new business opportunities  slower growth  and reduced revenue from existing contracts 
an economic downturn could negatively impact the financial condition of our clients  thereby increasing our risk of not receiving payment for services 
there can be no assurance that weakening economic conditions or acts of terrorism throughout the world will not adversely impact our results of operations and or financial position 
our business is subject to federal  state  and international regulations 
changes in us federal  state  and international outsourcing requirements  restrictions  and disclosures may affect the sale of our services  including expansion of overseas operations 
in the us  some of our services must comply with various federal and state requirements and regulations regarding the method and practices of placing outbound telephone calls 
there can be no assurance that changes in these regulations and requirements  or new restrictive regulations and requirements  will not slow growth of these services or require us to incur substantial costs 

table of contents our success is subject to the terms of our contracts 
most of our contracts do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue  and the profitability of each client program may fluctuate  sometimes significantly  throughout the various stages of a program 
our objective is to sign multi year contracts with our clients 
however  our contracts generally enable the clients to terminate the contract or reduce customer interaction volumes 
our larger contracts generally require the client to pay a contractually agreed amount in the event of early termination 
additionally  certain contracts have performance related bonus and or penalty provisions  whereby the client may pay us a bonus or we may have to issue a credit based upon our ability to meet agreed upon performance metrics 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect early termination fees  avoid performance penalties  or earn performance bonuses 
our business may be affected by our ability to obtain financing 
from time to time  we may need to obtain debt or equity financing for capital expenditures  for payment of existing obligations  or to replenish cash reserves 
additionally  our existing debt agreements require us to comply with certain financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing  or that any such financing would be on terms acceptable to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our debt agreements or  in the event of noncompliance  will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from the lenders 
our business may be affected by risks associated with international operations and expansion 
one component of our growth strategy is continued international expansion 
there are certain risks inherent with conducting international business including management of personnel overseas  longer payment cycles  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in complying with foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and social instability  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our business  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our international operations successfully 
our financial results may be impacted by our ability to find new locations 
our future success will be dependent upon being able to find cost effective locations in which to operate  both domestically and internationally 
there is no assurance that we will be able to find cost effective locations  obtain favorable lease terms  and build or retrofit facilities in a timely or economic manner 
our financial results may be adversely affected by increases in business costs 
some of our larger contracts allow us to increase our service fees if  and to the extent  certain cost or price indices increase 
the majority of our expenses are payroll and payroll related  which includes healthcare costs 
over the past several years  healthcare costs have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices 
increases in our service fees that are based upon increases in cost or price indices may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover increases in our costs through increased service fees 
our financial results depend on our ability to manage capacity utilization 
our profitability is influenced significantly by our cmc capacity utilization 
we attempt to maximize utilization 
however  because the majority of our business is inbound  we have significantly higher utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
we have experienced periods of idle capacity  particularly in our multi client cmcs 
historically  we experience idle peak period capacity upon opening a new cmc or termination or completion of a large client program 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our centers 
we may consolidate or close under performing centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in the event we close cmcs in the future  we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal cmc capacity utilization 
our business operates in a highly competitive market 
the market in which we operate is fragmented and highly competitive and competition may intensify in the future 
we compete with small firms offering specific applications  divisions of large entities  large independent firms  and  most significantly  the in house operations of clients or potential clients 
a number of competitors may develop greater capabilities and 
table of contents resources than ours 
because our primary competitors are the in house operations of existing or potential clients  our performance and growth could be adversely affected if our existing or potential clients decide to provide in house customer management services for customer care they currently outsource  or retain or increase their in house customer care and product support capabilities 
in addition  competitive pressures from current or future competitors also could cause our services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that additional competitors  some with greater resources than ours  will not enter our market 
our future success requires continued growth 
continued future growth will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to i initiate  develop  and maintain new client relationships  ii expand existing client programs  iii staff and equip suitable cmc facilities in a timely manner  and iv develop new solutions and enhance existing solutions we provide to our clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage expanded operations or maintain our profitability 
our financial results may be affected by rapidly changing technology 
our business is highly dependent on our computer and telecommunications equipment and software capabilities 
our failure to maintain our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated financial condition 
our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to i expand our existing solutions offerings  ii achieve cost efficiencies in our existing cmc operations  and iii introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments 
our ability to effectively market and implement software solutions developed by our database marketing and consulting segment  including recoverability of capitalized costs based on estimated future cash flows  is a factor in our future success 
there can be no assurance that technologies or services developed by our competitors will not render our products or services non competitive or obsolete  that we can successfully develop and market any new services or products  that any such new services or products will be commercially successful  or that the integration of new technological capabilities will achieve their intended cost reductions 
our success depends on key personnel 
our success will depend upon our ability to recruit  hire  and retain experienced executive personnel who can successfully execute our business plans 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire  motivate  and retain highly effective executive employees on economically feasible terms who can successfully execute our business plans 
our business is dependent on our ability to maintain our workforce 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to recruit  hire  train  and retain qualified employees 
our industry is labor intensive and experiences high employee turnover 
a significant increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs  thereby decreasing operating effectiveness and productivity 
also  if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs  we may need to recruit  hire  and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train  and retain sufficient qualified personnel to adequately staff new customer management programs 
in addition  certain cmcs are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates  which could make it more difficult and costly to hire qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able maintain our workforce at necessary levels 
our success may be affected by our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions and joint ventures 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions of companies with services  technologies  industry specializations  or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business 
we may face increased competition for acquisition opportunities  which may inhibit our ability to complete suitable acquisitions on favorable terms 
we may pursue strategic alliances in the form of joint ventures and partnerships  which involve many of the same risks as acquisitions as well as additional risks associated with possible lack of control if we do not have a majority ownership position 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions or joint ventures into our existing businesses  or that any acquisition or joint venture will enhance our business  results of operations  or financial condition 

table of contents our business depends on uninterrupted service to clients 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  cyber attacks  telecommunications interruption or failure  natural disaster  and other similar events 
our operations may also be adversely affected by damage to our facilities resulting from fire  natural disaster  or other events 
additionally  severe weather can cause interruption in our ability to deliver our services  such as when our employees cannot attend work  resulting in a loss of revenue 
in the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our locations including our corporate headquarters building  through the reasons noted above or otherwise  our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages or face the loss of certain clients altogether 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur 
our financial results may experience variability 
we experience quarterly variations in operating results because of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  we make decisions regarding staffing levels  investments  and other operating expenditures based on our revenue forecasts 
if our revenue is below expectations in any given quarter  our operating results for that quarter would likely be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that future quarterly or annual operating results will reflect past operating results 
our financial results may be impacted by foreign currency exchange risk 
we serve an increasing number of our us clients from cmcs in argentina  canada  india  mexico  and the philippines 
contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars while the costs incurred to operate these cmcs are denominated in the foreign currency of the country from which the clients are served  representing a foreign currency exchange risk to us 
although we enter into financial hedge instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates  we do not hedge of these risks 
if the us dollar weakens  the operating income of these cmcs  once translated into us dollars  decreases in comparison to prior years to the extent we have not hedged 
if the us dollar was to materially weaken  our consolidated financial results may be adversely impacted 
while our hedging strategy effectively offset a portion of these foreign currency changes during  there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully partially hedge this foreign currency exchange risk or that the us dollar will not materially weaken 
our financial results may be adversely impacted by our database marketing and consulting segment 
prior to  our database marketing and consulting segment had historically experienced high levels of profitability 
during  the segment reported an operating loss 
we have plans to return this segment to profitability 
a part of our plan provided for entering into a new agreement with ford for wherein we would provide services to ford s automotive dealerships on a preferred  not on an exclusive basis as was the previous agreement  in return for pricing flexibility 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing our plans to return this segment to prior levels of profitability 
we have approximately million of goodwill for this segment whose ultimate recoverability is dependent upon the profitability of this segment 
our consolidated financial results and consolidated financial position  including our ability to obtain financing  may be adversely impacted if we are unable to return that segment to previous profitability levels

executive overview we serve our clients through two primary businesses customer management services and database marketing and consulting 
customer management services provides outsourced customer support and marketing services for a variety of industries via cmcs throughout the world 
when we begin operations in a new country  we determine whether the country is intended to primarily serve us based clients  in which case we include the country in our north american customer care segment  or the country is intended to serve both domestic clients from that country and us based clients  in which case we include the country in our international customer care segment 
this is consistent with our management of the business  internal financial reporting structure  and operating focus 
operations for each segment of customer management services are conducted in the following countries north american customer care international customer care united states argentina canada australia india brazil philippines china germany malaysia mexico new zealand singapore spain united kingdom venezuela database marketing and consulting provides outsourced database management  direct marketing  and related customer acquisition and retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers 
segment accounting policies are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our preparation of segment information 

table of contents customer management services the customer management services business generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our representatives devote to a client s program 
we primarily focus on large global corporations in the following industries  automotive  communications and media  financial services  government  logistics  retail  technology  and travel 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
the majority of our revenue is  and we anticipate that the majority of our future revenue will continue to be  from multi year contracts 
however  we do provide certain client programs on a short term basis and our operations outside of north america are characterized by shorter term contracts 
additionally  we typically experience client attrition of approximately to of our revenue each year 
our client attrition in was  which we believe is attributable to our investment in an account management team 
our invoice terms with clients range from days to days  with longer terms in europe 
the customer management services industry is highly competitive 
our ability to sell existing services or gain acceptance for new products is challenged by the competitive nature of the industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell services to new clients  renew relationships with existing clients  or gain client acceptance of our new products 
we compete primarily with the in house customer management operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide customer management services on an outsourced basis 
in general  over the last several years  the global economy has negatively impacted the customer management market 
more specifically  sales cycles have lengthened  competition has increased  and contract values have been reduced 
however  we believe that sales cycles have begun shortening 
nonetheless  pricing pressures continue within our industry due to the rapid growth of offshore labor capabilities 
when renewing contracts  clients may request that all or a portion of the renewal work be located within international cmcs 
these requests decrease our revenue as the billing rate we charge for international cmcs is lower than for north american cmcs  and  in the short term  increase our costs as we incur expenses related to relocating the work 
for the year ended december  we incurred contract relocation costs of approximately million 
quarterly we review capacity utilization and projected demand for future capacity requirements 
in conjunction with these quarterly reviews  we may decide to consolidate or close under performing cmcs  including those impacted by the loss of a major client program  in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
because clients may request that we serve their customers from international cmcs with lower prevailing labor rates  in the future we may decide to close one or more us based cmcs  even though it is generating positive cash flow  because we believe the future profits from conducting such work outside the us may more than compensate for the one time charges related to closing the facility 
the short term focus of management is to increase revenue in both the north american customer care and international customer care segments by selling new business to existing clients  continuing to focus sales efforts on large  complex  multi center opportunities  differentiating our products and services by developing and offering new solutions to clients  and exploring merger and acquisition possibilities 
our ability to enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our clients operate 
a weakening of the us and or the global economy could lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our cmcs  the number of new or expanded programs during a period  and our success at managing personnel turnover 
table of contents and employee costs 
managing our costs is critical since we continue to see pricing pressure within our industry 
these pricing pressures have been accentuated by the rapid growth of offshore labor 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new cmcs or the expansion of existing cmcs 
as such  management considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations  or expansions of existing programs  and the potential size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
however  to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  to implement new programs  and to expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute a client contract as we concentrate our marketing efforts toward obtaining large  complex  customer management programs 
we internally target capacity utilization in our centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers was see financial comparison below for further details 
our profitability is also influenced by the number of new or expanded client programs 
as required by the adoption of emerging issues task force  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  for contracts entered into after july   in the event a client is billed for direct start up costs  the associated revenue and costs are deferred and recognized straight line over the life of the contract 
in the event that a client cannot be billed for direct start up costs  then those start up costs are expensed as incurred 
we strive to enter contracts where our clients pay separately for start up costs as opposed to incorporating them into the ongoing production rate 
our potential clients typically obtain bids from multiple vendors and evaluate many factors in selecting a service provider including  among other factors  the scope of services offered  the service record of the vendor  and price 
we generally price our bids with a long term view of profitability and  accordingly  we consider all of our fixed and variable costs in developing our bids 
we believe that our competitors may bid business based upon a short term view  as opposed to our longer term view  resulting in a lower price bid 
while we believe our clients perceptions of the value we provide results in our being successful in certain competitive bid situations  there are often situations where a potential client may prefer a lower cost 
our industry is very labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  costs of employee benefits  and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our cmcs are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover  and the length of training time required to implement new programs continues to increase due to increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs  and need to recruit  hire  and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
our success in improving our profitability will depend on successful execution of a comprehensive business plan  including the following broad steps increasing sales to absorb unused capacity in existing global cmcs  reducing costs and continued focus on cost controls  and managing our workforce in domestic and international cmcs in a cost effective manner 
database marketing and consulting our database marketing and consulting segment has relationships with over  automobile dealers representing different automotive brand names 
these contracts generally have terms ranging from month to month to months 
for a few major automotive manufacturers  the automotive manufacturer collects from the individual automobile dealers on our behalf 
our average collection period is days 

table of contents a majority of the revenue from this segment is generated utilizing a database and contact engine to promote the service business of automobile dealership customers using targeted marketing solutions through the web  e mail  phone  or mail 
a combination of factors contributed to this segment generating a loss from operations of approximately million for the year ended december  the primary factor is that our dealer attrition rate has exceeded our new account growth  resulting in a significant decrease in revenue from the prior year period a trend that is continuing into the first quarter of 
secondly  in connection with our program with ford whose dealers represent approximately of the revenue of our database marketing and consulting segment  we agreed to absorb dealer subsidies in return for obtaining anticipated additional dealers as clients and existing dealers increasing their utilization of our services 
due to a delay in the launch of that program and less than expected dealer growth and utilization  these subsidies  which are recorded as a reduction of revenue  have resulted in the program profitability being less than anticipated 
as the contract did not achieve our objectives  we have agreed with ford to a new program for wherein we provide services to ford s automotive dealerships on a preferred basis  rather than exclusive basis as was the previous agreement  as ford will be offering a competing product 
the new agreement gives us flexibility to customize service offerings and the ability to contract directly with ford s dealerships 
no assurances can be given that the new program will improve revenue or profitability or not cause the current trends to continue 
we plan to focus on the following during reducing our client attrition rate by improving customer services and increasing customer contact  increasing revenue by expanding our offerings  diversifying our client base by establishing relations with dealer groups and new automotive manufacturers  continuing to manage costs through operational effectiveness  and acquiring business platforms for similar and related services 
the clients of our database marketing and consulting segment  as well as our joint venture with ford  come primarily from the automotive industry 
the us automotive industry is currently reporting declining earnings  which may result in client losses  lower volumes  or place additional pricing pressures on our operations 
fourth quarter events during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an asset impairment charge in our international customer care segment of approximately million for our south korea cmc 
as of the end of  we i did not have any clients served from our south korea cmc and ii determined that we would not thereafter market that cmc and  accordingly  the related long lived assets were impaired  a million asset impairment in the north american customer care segment resulting from our decision to discontinue use of certain internally developed software  a restructuring charge of approximately million arising from a reduction in force in our international customer care segment  an increase of million for a change in the estimated liability for service taxes included in selling  general and administrative expense for the international customer care segment based upon new information from our outside legal counsel enabling a more accurate estimate  a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance for the international customer care segment of approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statements  and a decrease of million in tax expense arising from a more favorable tax filing position related to the foreign currency impact of intercompany transfer pricing 

table of contents also  during the fourth quarter of  we provided customer management services under a short term contract with the us government to aid in hurricane relief efforts 
the revenues related to this short term project were approximately of our consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of and materially impacted profitability as the project utilized excess cmc capacity 
during the fourth quarter  we discussed with the us government our belief that certain costs we incurred should be billed 
as no agreement was reached  we had not billed the us government  and accordingly did not recognize as revenue in approximately million of services 
we believe the work order should be amended to include such services 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining an amended work order for all or a portion of such services 
overall as shown in the financial comparison below see net increase to income from operations excluding items separately identified below  we believe that we have been successful in improving income from operations for our north american and international customer care segments 
the increases are attributable to a variety of factors such as our successfully performing under a short term us government program contract to provide hurricane relief efforts which ended prior to december   expansion of work on certain client programs  our multi phased cost reduction plan  transitioning work on certain client programs to lower cost operating centers  and taking actions to improve individual client program profit margins and or eliminate unprofitable client programs 
to address known changes in our business and  in particular  the decline in revenue and operating income due to the declining minimum commitments discussed further in client concentrations  we implemented an million profit improvement plan commencing in august we believe this plan  among other factors  enabled us to operate profitably during and these improvements were achieved primarily through cost savings in the areas of lower general and administrative headcount  terminating unprofitable client programs  improved cmc operations  exiting unprofitable operations  and a reduction in certain costs including telecommunications  professional fees  insurance  and reduced future interest expense associated with our debt restructuring plan 
during the third quarter of we announced our plan for an additional million of future cost savings to be achieved during and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we reduced the level of outstanding indebtedness since december  and expect to operate without material financial indebtedness unless we were to incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or to fund our stock repurchase program 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business and results of operations 
for further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting policies  certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
descriptions of these critical accounting policies follow revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time services are performed 
our customer management services business recognizes revenue under production rate and performance based models which are production rate 
revenue is recognized based on the billable hours or minutes of each csr  as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable hour or minute is based on a predetermined contractual rate 
this contractual rate can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality and performance 

table of contents performance based 
under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our clients based on achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual results against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
amounts collected from clients prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue 
hybrid 
under hybrid models we are paid a fixed fee or production element as well as a performance based element 
certain client programs provide for adjustments to monthly billings based upon whether we meet or exceed certain performance criteria as set forth in the contract 
increases or decreases to monthly billings arising from such contract terms are reflected in revenue as earned or incurred 
our database marketing and consulting segment recognizes revenue when services are rendered 
most agreements require the billing of predetermined monthly rates 
where the contractual billing periods do not coincide with the periods over which services are provided  we recognize revenue straight line over the life of the contract typically six to months 
from time to time  we make certain expenditures related to acquiring contracts recorded as contract acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
those expenditures are capitalized and amortized in proportion to the initial expected future revenue from the contract  which in most cases results in straight line amortization over the life of the contract 
these costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
some of our contracts are billed in advance 
accordingly  amounts billed and collected  but not earned  under these contracts are excluded from revenue and included in customer advances and deferred income 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
sfas no 
provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
we prepare a forecast of future taxable income  including domestic and international operating results and the reversal of existing temporary differences between income recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap and income for federal income tax reporting purposes 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that a recent history of cumulative losses constitutes significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about taxable income are overshadowed by such recent losses 
accordingly  the expectations of future taxable income would generally be limited to no more than two or three years for generating sufficient income to recover deferred tax assets 
based upon assessments of recoverability of our deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance as of december  is million 
this valuation allowance is principally related to deferred tax assets associated with the local operations in the argentina  india  south korea  and spain 
as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets as of december  related to the us and other international jurisdictions whose recoverability is dependent upon future profitability 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter  management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment are the age of the identified receivable  client financial wherewithal  previous client history  and any recent communications with the client 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our individual cmcs in accordance with sfas no 
to assess whether estimated future operating results will be sufficient to recover the carrying costs of the long lived assets 
when the operating results of a center have deteriorated to the point it is likely that losses will continue for the foreseeable future  or we expect that a cmc will be closed or otherwise disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life  we select the cmc for further review 
for cmcs selected for further review  we estimate the probability weighted future cash flows from operating the center over its useful life 
significant judgment is involved in projecting future capacity utilization  pricing  labor costs  and the estimated useful life of the center 
we do not subject to the same test cmcs that have been operated for less than two years or those centers that have been impaired within the past two years the two year rule because we believe sufficient time is necessary to establish a market presence and build a client base for such new or modified centers in order to adequately assess recoverability 
however  such cmcs are nonetheless evaluated in case other factors would indicate impairment had occurred 
for impaired cmcs  we write the assets down to estimated fair market value 
if the assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove insufficient  the fair value estimate of the cmcs may be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed fair value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
excluding the fully impaired centers in glasgow  scotland and south korea see note to the consolidated financial statements  a sensitivity analysis of the impairment evaluation was completed at year end assuming that the future results were less than the current operating performance for these cmcs 
as shown in the table below  the analysis indicated that an impairment of approximately million would arise 
however  for the cmcs tested  the current probability weighted projection scenarios indicated that an impairment had not occurred as of december  the following table summarizes the sensitivity analysis we performed during the fourth quarter of impairment net under book number sensitivity value of cmcs test in thousands  except number of cmcs tested based on two year rule positive cash flow in period negative cash flow in period not tested based on two year rule positive cash flow in period negative cash flow in period total positive cash flow in period negative cash flow in period of the seven cmcs not tested based on the two year rule  one became eligible for testing during the fourth quarter of that center is currently experiencing negative cash flows 
however  we recently launched a new program in the cmc that increases utilization to and  we believe  will allow us to recover the carrying value 
the amount of impairment under the sensitivity test included in the table above for that cmc is million 
we have recorded during impairment charges of million and million for cmcs in glasgow  scotland and south korea  respectively  excluding charges related to exit or disposal activities to be recorded during when we plan to exit these facilities 
we also assess the realizable value of capitalized software on a quarterly basis  based upon current estimates of future cash flows from services utilizing the software principally utilized by our database marketing and consulting segment 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to discontinue the use of certain software used by the north american customer care segment  resulting in an asset impairment of million 

table of contents goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually for reporting units one level below the segment level in accordance with sfas no 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales  or valuations of other similar businesses 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises during an intervening period 
the most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services  and projected labor costs 
we then use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
if actual results are less than the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
based on the analyses performed in the fourth quarter of  there was no impairment to the december  goodwill balance of our north american and international customer care segments of million 
if projected revenue used in the analysis of goodwill was less than forecast the projections assumed revenue growth rates ranging from to per annum over a three year period  there would still be no impairment to goodwill 
our database marketing and consulting segment has recently experienced operating losses  but generated positive free cash flow  exclusive of corporate allocations  of million in we have plans to improve the profitability of that segment during the goodwill for our database marketing and consulting segment is million as of december  the results of our probability weighted cash flow analyses used to estimate the fair value of this segment indicated that an impairment in goodwill had not occurred as of december  we engaged an independent appraisal firm to assess the fair value of this segment 
the independent firm s assessment also indicated that no impairment in goodwill had occurred as of december  restructuring liability 
we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our cmcs 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing cmcs and complete reductions in workforce to enhance future profitability 
we follow sfas no 
 which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  instead of upon commitment to a plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of estimated liability for closing cmcs is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on a third party broker s assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the facility 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a future gain  in our consolidated statements of operations 
contingencies 
we record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  management reviews these matters on a case by case basis and assigns probability of loss based upon the assessments of in house counsel and outside counsel  as appropriate

presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow 
free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash flows from operating activities  or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful  in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash flows from operating activities  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also excludes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions  investments  and other needs that may arise

potential future impairments are discussed under critical accounting policies

costs of services 
costs of services as a percentage of revenue in north american customer care decreased mostly due to the successful implementation of our plan to reduce costs and increase client profitability

additionally  we recorded a one time charge of million related to the termination of an interest rate swap 
income taxes 
when compared to  income tax expense in decreased million to million even though pre tax book income increased million 
this is primarily due to the fact that in we increased our valuation allowance by million and wrote off a million deferred tax asset related to our investment in ehi and did not incur any similar tax charges in also  in we benefited by not recording deferred tax expense with respect to new deferred tax assets in tax jurisdictions with valuation allowances  such as the us  to the extent we were generating current taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity during were existing cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  and borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
we expect that our future working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations 
our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to i sell new business  ii expand existing client relationships  and iii efficiently manage our operating costs 
the amount of capital required in will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain  upgrade  or replace existing assets 
we currently expect that capital expenditures in will be approximately the same as our capital expenditures 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures  among other factors 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december    and cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  free cash flow 
free cash flow see presentation of non gaap measurements for definition of free cash flow was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease from to primarily resulted from increased accounts 
table of contents receivable balances primarily from the ramp up of the short term government program discussed above  and higher cash paid for tax expense 
the increase from to resulted from an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of approximately million and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
the increase in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily attributable to a benefit in deferred income taxes and the company operating profitably for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to the purchase of our headquarters building 
cash flows from operating activities 
we reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business or purchases of treasury stock 
for the years ended december    and  we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted from changes in working capital accounts  primarily due to increased accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from the ramp up of the short term government program discussed previously and other new or expanded clients that ramped in the fourth quarter of cash flows from investing activities 
we reinvest cash in our business primarily to grow our client base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december    and  we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease from to million primarily resulted from the purchase of our headquarters building 
cash flows from financing activities 
for the years ended december    and  we reported net cash flows used in provided by financing activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease from to of million principally resulted from the repayment of our long term debt and credit facility 
cash used for financing activities during primarily represents approximately million for repurchases of our stock offset by approximately million of borrowings under our line of credit 
obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows less than over year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations grant advances purchase obligations operating lease commitments total reflected on consolidated balance sheets not reflected on consolidated balance sheets purchase obligations 
occasionally we contract with certain of our communications clients which represent approximately one third of our annual revenue to provide us with telecommunication services 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arms length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements 
our cash requirements include capital expenditures primarily related to ongoing maintenance  upgrades or replacement of existing assets  the development and retrofit of new and or 
table of contents existing cmcs  possible acquisitions of companies  formations of joint ventures  and repurchases of common stock 
we expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million attributable to i maintenance capital for existing cmcs  ii the opening and or expansion of cmcs  and iii internal technology projects 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional cmc capacity and technological infrastructure 
we may consider restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions  and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures  or the incurrence  assumption  or refinancing of indebtedness  and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company 
the launch of large client contracts may result in negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program  and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants we discuss debt instruments and related covenants in note to consolidated financial statements 
client concentrations our five largest clients accounted for   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition  these five clients accounted for an even greater proportional share of our consolidated earnings 
the profitability of services provided to these clients varies greatly based upon the specific contract terms with any particular client 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis 
the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
the contracts with these clients expire between and additionally  a particular client can have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed  or if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
under the terms of the original contract with verizon communications verizon relating to its competitive local exchange carrier clec business  there were certain minimum monthly volume commitments at pre determined hourly billing rates minimum commitments 
as previously reported  when the clec work was redirected to other verizon business units during  verizon continued to honor the contractual terms of its minimum commitments 
while the terms negotiated by these business units were generally at lower hourly billing rates base rates than the minimum commitments  verizon continued to meet its financial obligations associated with the minimum commitments 
in addition  we agreed to settle for cash certain remaining minimum commitments with verizon and these settlement payments were amortized over the life of such minimum commitments 
the minimum commitments had been satisfied by december  the amount of minimum commitments satisfied by verizon in excess of the base rates  together with amortized settlement payments  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these amounts impacted pre tax earnings by a like amount and  accordingly  the decline had an adverse effect on our operating results in and recent accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates  london inter bank offer rate libor  and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   we had entered into financial hedge instruments with several financial institutions to manage and reduce the impact of changes principally in the us canadian dollar exchange rates 
interest rate risk the interest rate on our credit facility is variable based upon the prime rate and libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   there was a million outstanding balance under the credit facility 
if the prime rate increased basis points  there would not be a material impact to the company 
foreign currency risk we have operations in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  india  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  the philippines  singapore  spain  the united kingdom  and venezuela 
the expenses from these operations  and in some cases the revenue  are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our revenue and net income attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december    and  revenue from non us countries represented   and of consolidated revenue  respectively 
a business strategy for our north american customer care segment is to serve certain us based clients from cmcs located in foreign countries  including argentina  canada  india  mexico  and the philippines  in order to leverage the associated us foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to mitigate the risk of these foreign currencies strengthening against the us dollar  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  but not  of the foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from changes in the us foreign currency exchange rates in the short term  an overall strengthening of the foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the north american customer care segment over the long term 
the majority of this type of work is performed from cmcs located in canada 
during the years ended december  and  the canadian dollar strengthened against the us dollar by and  respectively 
we have contracted with several financial institutions on behalf of our canadian subsidiary to acquire a total of million canadian dollars through march at a fixed price in us dollars of million 
as of december   we had total derivative assets associated with foreign exchange contracts of million  of which canadian dollar derivative assets represented million of this value settles in 
if the us canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease from period end levels  we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains or losses in the underlying exposures 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency while some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
for example  the intercompany transactions that are expected to be settled are denominated in the local currency of the billing company 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign 
table of contents currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we strive to settle these accounts on a timely basis 
fair value of debt and equity securities we did not have any investments in debt or equity securities at december
