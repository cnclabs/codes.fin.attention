item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results o f operations should be read in conjunction with the description of the company s business and properties contained in items and of part i and th e consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in thi s report 
results of operations and total revenues for the year ended december  were million generating income from continuing operations and net income of million an d million  respectively 
for the year ended december   tota l revenues were million  generating income from continuing operations an d net income of million and million  respectively 
the compan y recognized million of interest and dividend income during  an increas e of million or over  primarily as the result of higher interes t rates and the increased investment in dividend paying securities 
the results include million in gains on the sale o f available for sale securities and million in gains on the sale of rea l estate  on a net of tax basis  above those recognized in the current year 
i n addition  the prior year results include the tax benefit from several charitabl e donations of real estate made by the company last year 
the company s historical results have been significantly affected by the timin g of events including the sale of marketable securities and real estate assets which were dependent upon economic conditions at the time of the sale 
th e company is unable to predict if or when such events will recur 
real estate operations rental revenues from real estate operations increased 
million or t o million for the year ended december   compared to million i n the increase in rental revenues is primarily attributable to increases i n hotel operating revenue  and tenant reimbursements  partially offset by a reduction in rental revenues resulting from certai n mid year vacancies in the company s portfolio during the increase in hote l operating revenue is primarily the result of improved lodging demand due to a stronger us economy and a reduction in the supply of new hotels and th e company s november acquisition of a hotel located in windsor locks connecticut the connecticut hotel 
in general  rental revenues do no t fluctuate significantly due to the long term nature of the company s leases however  future rental revenues could be affected by changes in hotel operatin g revenues  which are generally influenced by local and other economic conditions as well as by lease renewals  terminations  step ups and escalations and by th e purchase or sale of additional properties 
mortgage interest expense continued to decrease as a result of continuin g mortgage amortization 
such expense totaled  for the year ended decembe r   compared to  for  a decline of  or 
th e connecticut hotel was partially funded by an million mortgage on th e property 
as a result  mortgage interest expense should increase during depreciation expense associated with real properties held for rental decrease d  or for the year ended december   compared to th e decrease is primarily attributable to reduced depreciation expense associate d with certain properties or improvements becoming fully depreciated in th e current and prior year and is partially offset by depreciation from current yea r additions 
depreciation expense on the company s properties will continue t o decline as properties become fully depreciated  but with the addition of th e connecticut hotel in november and expenditures for capital improvements depreciation expense will likely rise over that reported in the current year

although management believes that sales of its engineere d products segments are directly influenced by general economic conditions worldwide automotive demand and industrial capital spending  future sales o f this segment could also be affected by changes in technology  competitive force s or challenges to its intellectual property 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased for the year ende d december   compared to  primarily related to the shift in segmen t sales  as noted above  and increases in the cost of raw materials  primaril y steel components 
in addition  the company incurred rework and nonconformanc e costs associated with a new product line  primarily during the first six month s of selling  general and administrative expenses of the engineered products segmen t remained relatively consistent  decreasing  or for the year ende d december   compared to the decrease was primarily due to decrease s in payroll and payroll related expenses  and freight costs  partially offset by an increase in professional fees

other income and expenses  net other income and expenses  net decreased million from million i n to million in the decrease is primarily due to the sale o f the company s interest in prime hospitality corp 
which resulted in a gain o f million in that year and is partially offset by gains on the sale of th e company s interest in a joint venture which owns and operates a hotel located i n quebec  canada the quebec venture  as well as the sale by a join t venture which owned and operated a hotel located in new jersey the hote l venture of its underlying assets in

cost of sales as a percentage of net sales remained relatively consistent fo r the year ended december  as compared to  fluctuating by less the n selling  general and administrative expenses of the engineered products segmen t increased  or for the year ended december  over that o f the increase is primarily due to increased freight costs  a s well as from higher payroll and payroll related costs  and commission s  which also fluctuated with the change in sales noted above 
thes e increases are partially offset by a reduction in professional fees  license fees associated with an agreement that expired in  and a decrease in amortization expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses not associated with the manufacturin g operations decreased  or during  compared to such expense s incurred in the decrease is principally due to lower professional fee s  and pension related expenses  offset by higher insuranc e costs  and depreciation expenses 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net increased million or to millio n for the year ended december   compared to the increase i s principally due to higher net gains on available for sale securities million  which primarily relates to the million gain recognized upon th e sale of the company s interest in prime hospitality corp  the receipt o f  in casualty insurance proceeds and a  gain on the sale of othe r assets 
these increases are partially offset by lower net realized an d unrealized gains on derivative instruments million  lower equity i n earnings of the hotel ventures  a non recurring deposit forfeitur e  which occurred in  and lower net realized and unrealized gain s on trading securities  during income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations was for the year ende d december   versus for the year ended december  th e reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of tax benefits fro m the donation of certain properties to qualified organizations during discontinued operations income from operations on properties sold or held for sale and accounted for a s discontinued was  on a net of tax basis  for the year ended decembe r   versus  for the comparable period of  which includes a full year of operating results for those properties sold in and thes e amounts have been reclassified to reflect results of operations of rea l properties currently classified as held for sale or disposed of during or as discontinued operations 
during  the company divested itself of ten properties which had a net boo k value of million 
the cash proceeds from these transactions were million 
in addition  the company received an  purchase money mortgag e in connection with the sale of one of these properties 
two of the propertie s disposed of were contributed to charitable organizations 
net gains on th e disposal of real estate assets accounted for as discontinued operations wer e million  on a net of tax basis  for the year ended december  during  the company sold properties with proceeds totaling million excluding proceeds of million received during from properties sold i n prior years and accounted for under the installment method 
net gains on th e sale of real estate accounted for as discontinued operations were millio n on a net of tax basis for the year ended december   which includes a million gain  on a net of tax basis  relating to a property sold in and recognized under the installment method in accordance with accountin g principles generally accepted in the united states of america offset by a  write down  on a net of tax basis  for a property disposed of i n january for a sale price below its carrying value 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided net cash of approximately million durin g this compares with  of operating cash flow produced in additional interest and dividend income of million earned in is th e primary cause of this increase 
the increase in interest rates and the company s increased holdings in dividend paying securities resulted in a increase i n interest and dividend income over that earned in changes in operatin g assets and liabilities during consumed million in cash 
the mos t significant of which were income taxes million and notes and account s receivable million 
the latter of which was caused by the delay in th e receipt of a portion of the proceeds in connection with the sale of th e company s interest in the quebec venture  which was received in early cas h flows from operating activities in were million lower than the million produced in income tax payments on the considerably higher income including gains on sales of real estate assets  which are accounted for a s discontinued operations  is the primary cause of this decline 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in versus million in the timing of certain events is the primary cause of thi s fluctuation 
proceeds from the sale of real estate assets were millio n lower while cash used for the acquisition of real estate and other fixed asset s was million higher in the current year than the respective amounts in the increase in acquisition costs includes the purchase of the connecticut hote l in november  net of the related mortgage 
offsetting these reductions i n current year cash flows from investing activities are million in sal e proceeds and distributions related to the company s interest in certain join t ventures and million in additional net proceeds from the available for sal e security transactions in versus the respective amounts in cash provided by investing activities in exceeded those of by million 
this increase primarily results from the timing of the purchase or sal e of available for sale securities million and additional proceeds fro m the sale of real estate and other assets million  partially offset by a decrease in distributions from the company s investments in joint venture s million 
during november  the company acquired the connecticut hotel fo r approximately million  including million which was allocated t o furniture  fixtures and equipment 
the purchase was partially financed by a n million mortgage which bears interest at per annum  is payable monthl y based on a year amortization and matures in december the total cost o f the acquisition  less the proceeds of the mortgage  is reflected in acquisitio n of additions to real estate assets in the consolidated statements of cash flows net cash used in financing activities was approximately million durin g  which primarily consists of the purchase and retirement of  share s of the company s common stock for approximately million and principa l payments on mortgage obligations million  including those associated wit h discontinued operations 
in  net cash used in financing activities was approximately millio n which primarily consists of principal payments on mortgage obligations million  including those associated with discontinued operations 
in  net cash used in financing activities was approximately million which primarily consists of a special one time cash dividend of per commo n share split adjusted paid to all stockholders of record  totaling million  principal payments on mortgage obligations of million  includin g those associated with discontinued operations  and the purchase and retiremen t of  shares of the company s common stock for approximately million 
in november  the board of directors authorized a dutch auction self tender offer for up to one million shares of the company s common stoc k resulting in the january repurchase of  shares of common stock fo r an aggregate purchase price of million or per share 
previous purchases of the company s common stock have reduced the company s additional paid in capital to zero and have also reduced retained earnings b y amounts in excess of par value 
any future purchases in excess of par value wil l also reduce retained earnings 
repurchases of the company s common stock may b e made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices and may b e made in privately negotiated transactions  subject to available resources future proceeds from the issuance of common stock in excess of par value will b e credited to retained earnings until such time that previously recorde d reductions have been recovered 
at december   the company s cash and marketable securities were million and working capital was million  compared to cash and marketabl e securities of million and working capital of million at decembe r  management continues to believe that the real estate market i s overvalued and accordingly acquisitions have been limited to those selec t properties that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
managemen t believes that the available working capital puts the company in an opportun e position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio  if and when attractiv e long term opportunities become available 
as a result of the company s presen t level of liquidity  the company terminated it s revolving credit facility i n july the company may establish a new facility in the future if the compan y believes it were to become necessary and cost effective to do so 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in to owne d joint ventures in which the company has the ability to exercise significan t influence  but not control 
these investments are recorded initially at cost an d subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions an d distributions 
the debt of the joint ventures in which the company currently ha s an ownership interest are non recourse obligations and are collateralized by th e entity s real property 
the company believes that the value of the underlyin g property and its operating cash flows are sufficient to satisfy its obligations the company is not obligated for the debts of the joint ventures  but coul d decide to satisfy them in order to protect its investment 
in such event  th e company s capital resources and financial condition would be reduced and  i n certain instances  the carrying value of the company s investment and it s results of operations would be negatively impacted 
the guarantee provided b y the company in connection with its investment in the hotel venture wa s terminated with the sale of the underlying property and satisfaction of th e mortgage in september see note of notes to consolidated financia l statements 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated b y current operations 
it is expected that future operational cash needs will als o be satisfied from existing cash balances  marketable securities  ongoin g operations or borrowings 
the primary source of capital to fund additional rea l estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans may com e from existing funds  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained i n connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting o f cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties i n exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company ma y also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings fro m institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equit y securities 
the company currently has no agreements  commitments o r understandings with respect to the acquisition of other companies or th e acquisition of real properties in exchange for equity or debt securities 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasin g real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested b y the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates o f deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in u 
s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cas h equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
given the level o f cash and other interest bearing investments held by the company and the increas e in us interest rates  the company s earnings have been favorably impacted 
in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell commo n stock short or participate in put and or call options 
these instruments do no t qualify for hedge accounting and therefore changes in such derivatives fai r value are recognized in earnings 
these derivatives are recorded as a componen t of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout th e world 
historically  a small number of customers have accounted for significan t portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by th e engineered products segment to general motors  its largest customer  accounte d for of the segment s sales 
the company does not believe their sales t o general motors will be significantly lower in since our engineere d products segment accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  th e loss of general motors as a customer or its filing for bankruptcy protectio n would adversely affect the company s revenues  cash flows and results o f operations 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sell s its products in those markets as well as in europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such a s changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in th e foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of th e company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended decembe r   and   and of the net sales of the company s engineered products segment were denominated in euros  respectively 
as such  a portion of the company s receivables are exposed to fluctuations with the u 
s dollar 
however  the company does not believe this risk to be material to it s overall financial position 
since the euro has been relatively stable i n relation to the us dollar  the company s results have not been significantl y impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses in the past 
accordingly  th e company has not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge this exposure if such exposure were to increase in the future  the company may reexamine thi s practice to minimize the associated risks 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and o r remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has recorded a liabilit y for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associate d therewith 
see environmental regulations in item of part i and note commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statement s for further discussion on this matter 
the company is subject to various other litigation  legal  regulatory and ta x matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
whe n management believes it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and suc h amounts are reasonably estimable  the company provides for amounts that includ e judgments and penalties that may be assessed 
these liabilities are usuall y included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long ter m liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  depending on th e anticipated payment date 
at december  and  the company ha d approximately million recorded in other long term liabilities relating t o such matters 
none of these matters are expected to result in a material advers e effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results o f operations

critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of americ a requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions tha t affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  an d related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain of th e estimates and assumptions required to be made relate to matters that ar e inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
while management believe s that the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actua l results could differ significantly from those estimates under differen t assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of those accountin g policies believed by management to require subjective and complex judgment s which could potentially affect reported results 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable real estate investment an d management the company leases substantially all of its properties to tenants under ne t leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
under this type of lease the tenant is obligated to pay all operating costs of the property includin g real estate taxes  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
revenue is recognize d as earned and deemed collectible 
the effect of stepped rent increases o n significant leases are recorded  net of allowances  on a straight line basis gains on sales of real estate assets and equity investments are recorded whe n the gain recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles i n the united states of america have been met 
the company does not have leases that include significant rent concessions o r provisions that require the lessee to fund capital improvements or to pay th e lessor any revenues based upon indexes or rates that are not explicitly state d in the lease 
reimbursements of certain costs received from tenants are recognized as tenan t reimbursement revenues 
certain lease agreements provide for additional rent based on a percentage o f tenants sales 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sale s levels are achieved 
income on leveraged leases is recognized by a method that produces a constan t rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease  net of the relate d deferred tax liability  in the years in which the net investment is positive 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of th e allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company makes estimates of th e uncollectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rents  tenan t escalations  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyze s accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthines s and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance fo r doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimate s are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition an d post petition claims 
the company s net income is directly affected b y management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable engineered products in general  sales are recorded when products are shipped  title has passed an d collection is reasonably assured 
management believes that adequate controls ar e in place to ensure compliance with contractual product specifications  a substantial history of such performance has been established and historica l returns and allowances have not been significant 
if actual sales returns an d allowances exceed historical amounts  the company s sales would be adversel y affected 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of th e allowance for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections experience current economic trends and a percentage of its accounts receivable by agin g category 
in determining these percentages  the company looks at historica l write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality o f its customer base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the compan y continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers 
while credi t losses have historically been within expectations and the provision s established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experienc e the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
the company s net income i s directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of account s receivable 
marketable securities the company determines the appropriate classification of marketable securitie s at the time of purchase and reassesses the appropriateness of the classificatio n at each reporting date 
at december  and  all marketable securitie s held by the company have been classified as available for sale and  as a result are stated at fair value  based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains an d losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component o f stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities  a s determined on a first in  first out basis  are included in the consolidate d statements of income 
the company reviews its investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether o r not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value if it is believed that an other than temporary decline exists  the company wil l write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss in the consolidated statements of income 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s classification o f marketable securities  as well as its determination of whether a n other than temporary decline in the value of its investments exists 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost bein g determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company regularly review s inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolet e inventory based primarily on existing and anticipated design and engineerin g changes to its products as well as forecasts of future product demand 
th e company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of th e realizability of inventories 
real estate land  buildings and improvements and equipment are recorded at cost  les s accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance an d repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations an d replacements  which improve the life of the asset  are capitalized an d depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimate d useful lives of to years for buildings  ten to years for renovation s and improvements and five to years for equipment and fixtures 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fai r value less costs to sell and depreciation is discontinued 
property sales o r dispositions are recorded when title transfers 
upon disposition  the relate d costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts 
an y gain or loss on sale or disposition is recognized in accordance with accountin g principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the norma l course of business  the company receives offers for the sale of properties either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  th e prospective buyer usually requires a due diligence period before consummation o f the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in th e withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
if circumstances aris e that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  management decide s not to sell a property classified as held for sale  the property is reclassifie d as held for rental 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorde d individually at the lower of its carrying amount before being classified as hel d for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognize d had the property been continuously classified as held for rental or its fai r market value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives o f its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflec t on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company adjust th e expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over th e adjusted years  and result in a revised depreciation expense and net income 
discontinued operations the company is required to make certain subjective assessments utilizing th e provisions of sfas no 
in determining whether a long lived asset to b e disposed of should be reclassified as discontinued operations 
the compan y considers real property to be held for sale and reported as discontinue d operations if management commits to a plan to sell the asset under usual an d customary terms and believes such sale will be completed within one year 
i n such event  the financial results associated with these assets are reclassifie d as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
although operating income income from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations ar e directly affected by management s assessments  the reclassification has n o impact on net income 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators tha t the value of its long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value i s considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projecte d operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the asse t over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the asset such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operatin g income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition an d other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of th e asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there ar e impairments in the value of its long lived assets and other investments 
th e company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate o f impairments 
in determining impairment  if any  the company has adopted sfas no pension plan pension plans can be a significant cost of doing business  but represen t obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and therefore ar e subject to estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognitio n of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based o n the terms of the plan and the investment and funding decisions made by th e company 
the company is required to make assumptions regarding such variables a s the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied t o determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expens e for the year 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance wit h sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 whic h requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on a n actuarial basis 
sfas no 
generally reduces the volatility of future incom e expense from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performanc e of the pension plan s assets 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension incom e expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on pla n assets to be in each of the last three years 
based on the company s existin g and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performanc e results  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of i s reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value o f plan assets in a systematic manner 
this produces the expected return on pla n assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between thi s expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the ne t deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of pla n assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
a basis poin t change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would hav e changed fiscal pension expense by  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from th e potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result o f fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodit y prices 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company principally i n the hedging of overall market risks and the management of its interest rat e exposure 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserv e principal and maximize yields without significantly increasing market risk 
t o achieve this  management maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents an d investments in a variety of securities  primarily us investments in bot h common and preferred equity issues 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasin g real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested b y the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates o f deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in u 
s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cas h equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
given the level o f cash and other interest bearing investments held by the company and the increas e in us interest rates  the company s earnings have been favorably impacted 
the company s marketable securities consist of us investments in both commo n and preferred equity issues and are subject to the fluctuations in us stoc k markets 
most of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate an d self amortizing from the net cash flow of the underlying properties
