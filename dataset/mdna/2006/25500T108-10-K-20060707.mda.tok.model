we disposed of our optical business in july  which resulted in the financial results from our optical business being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and contributed to our ability to return to positive net income during fiscal following our fiscal return to profitability  we reversed a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  resulting in a million tax benefit in fiscal following our acquisition of jasomi  we wrote off  of in process r d and amortized  of acquired intangible assets in fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of ite business regarding these statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see item a risk factors for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market telecommunications equipment for use in canceling echo and enhancing voice quality in voice calls over wireline  wireless and internet protocol ip telecommunications networks 
our products monitor and enhance voice quality and provide security in the delivery of voice services 
since entering the voice processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our more recent product introductions have leveraged the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also enhanced vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
since becoming a public company in june  our financial success has been primarily predicated on the macroeconomic environment of us wireline and  more recently  wireless carriers as well as our success in selling to the larger carriers 
since the beginning of calendar year  large north american telecommunications service providers have engaged in merger and acquisition activity 
such activity largely drove our fiscal revenue decline of as one of our two largest fiscal us customers was and continues to be involved in post merger integration and  consequently  orders from that customer in fiscal were nominal 
our revenue will continue to be heavily influenced by the buying trends of verizon wireless  our largest customer in fiscal at of our total worldwide revenue 
our revenue also will continue to be primarily generated from sales of our bvp flex  which accounted for of our revenue in fiscal in an attempt to diversify our customer base  beginning in fiscal and throughout fiscal  we added sales and marketing resources to focus on new large account opportunities in the united states 
in the united states  we believe that our continued focus on voice quality in the competitive wireless services landscape and the continued expansion of wireless networks will be key factors in adding new customers and driving our revenue growth 
internationally  we have also added sales resources and invested in customer trials 
the development of our vqa feature set was targeted at the international gsm market 
in fiscal  orascom telecom holding orascom became our largest vqa sale to date  as well as a step toward our goal of greater customer diversification 
while from fiscal to fiscal our international revenue declined from million to million  we generated million of international revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we currently have revenue deferrals and orders from which we expect to generate million of international revenue in the first quarter of fiscal we continue to focus on international mobile carriers who might best apply our vqa solution 
we expect additional long term opportunities for growth will occur in voip based network deployments as there appears to be a growing trend of service providers transitioning from traditional circuit switched network infrastructure to voip 
we have therefore directed the majority of our r d spending  since the beginning of fiscal  towards the development of our packet voice processor  a new platform targeting voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor  currently in its beta phase  introduces cost effective voice format transcoding capabilities and combines our vqa software and newly developed pqa technology to improve call quality and clarity by eliminating acoustic echo and voice level imbalances and reducing packet loss  delay and jitter 
to further develop a presence in the voip market  we acquired jasomi 
jasomi s currently available peerpoint c session border controller enables voip calls to traverse the nat and protects networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
we plan to combine the packet voice processor and session border controller technologies to provide a more comprehensive solution to carriers border services needs 
in fiscal  we recognized modest revenue from peerpoint and sold our first packet voice processor beta unit in the fourth quarter 
exit of optical business 
in may  we announced a change to our strategic direction 
we decided to focus all of our assets in continuing to grow our voice processing business  including our echo cancellation and vqa products  and as a result we decided to sell our optical communications business 
in july  we completed the primary step in our planned exit of our optical communications business through the sale of a large portion of the assets of the optical communications business to jds uniphase corporation jdsu 
the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory  certain specified optical related equipment and intellectual property rights  which were sold for an aggregate purchase price of up to approximately million in cash  of which a approximately million was paid to us at closing  b  to be paid to us one year from the closing subject to reduction in the event any successful indemnification claims are made against us  and c up to an additional million to be paid to us  which is comprised of up to  based on the level of inventory consumed by jdsu  and up to million based on revenues generated by the optical business acquired by jdsu through june   if any 
additionally  jdsu had the right to require us to reimburse jdsu for any purchased but unused inventory at june   up to million  which right expired as of july  jdsu also had indemnification rights in connection with the performance of certain warranty obligations relating to optical products that were sold by us on or prior to july  in fiscal  we recognized  associated with the level of revenue generated by jdsu since the close of the sale 
the proceeds were substantially offset by increased loss accruals associated with exiting our international optical operations and an estimated loss provision associated with our indemnification of the realizable value of the inventory purchased by jdsu 
the net effect of these items was reported as an incremental net loss on disposition of discontinued operations in fiscal of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal  income from discontinued operations was due to adjustments needed to reflect actual costs incurred and to recognize a tax benefit due to the release of our valuation reserve 
in june  we and jdsu came to a mutual settlement and release whereby jdsu paid us  and released us from our warranty obligation 
in addition  in june  we completed the closure of our international optical operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have sold or abandoned all of the assets not purchased by jdsu 
as a result of exiting the optical business  our consolidated statements of operations reflect the optical business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition history 
in the last five fiscal years  we have completed two acquisitions 
in july  we acquired atmosphere networks  inc to bring then needed technical skills to our optical engineering group 
in may  we recorded a transitional impairment of the unamortized goodwill balance associated with this acquisition of million  which was reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
in june  we acquired jasomi  which developed and sold session border controllers that enable voip calls to traverse the nat and protect networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
the combination of ditech s packet voice processor and jasomi s session border control technology may enable ditech to provide a more comprehensive solution to carriers border service needs 
consideration for the acquisition included million in cash  escrow payments  vested options assumed  acquisition costs  and net liabilities assumed plus million in non transferable convertible notes 
the payment of the full million principal amount of the convertible notes is contingent on the retention of a specified number of designated employees and is not reflected in the purchase price 
we additionally issued shares of ditech restricted stock to new employees hired as part of the acquisition 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our customer base 
historically  the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
these customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  sales to some of our us customers may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
we expect that as we expand shipments of our newer voice processing products  which are targeted at gsm networks  international revenue will begin to become a larger percentage of our overall revenue 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our largest customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal our five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of any one of our largest customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a negative and substantial effect on our business 
this customer concentration risk was evidenced in fiscal as revenue was approximately of our fiscal revenue primarily due to a lack of orders from one of two largest fiscal customers 
this caused fiscal to result in a net loss 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenue  allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties and recovery of deferred income taxes 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
to the extent there are material differences between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of customers 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the united states and our relationships with them are documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred million of revenue 
to the extent that we have received cash for some or all of a given deferred revenue transaction  we reported it on the consolidated balance sheet as a deferred revenue liability 
however  to the extent that we have not collected cash against the deferred revenue transaction  we reflect the deferred revenue as a reduction in the corresponding account receivable balance 
of the million of revenue deferred as of april   million related to deferrals associated with installations and  was associated with maintenance contracts 
in dealing with smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
investments investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities  which we are able to liquidate on or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
other investment securities with remaining maturities of one year or more are considered long term investments 
short term investments currently consist primarily of corporate bonds and asset backed securities 
we have classified our short term and long term investments as available for sale securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are included in interest income based on specific identification 
interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included in interest income 
inventory valuation in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation  we are constantly monitoring projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of allowances required both for inventory on hand  as well as inventory on order from our contract manufacturer 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying allowance requirements in a timely manner  sudden changes in future buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels could result in some larger than anticipated write downs being recognized  such as the oc write down recorded in fiscal for the oc write down  the complete pull back from the forecasted demand by the primary customer for this product resulted in a million write down of the oc inventory 
however  beginning in  the addition of a few large new customers helped to utilize a large portion of the inventory which had been written down and we consequently sold million and  of written down oc inventory in fiscal and  respectively 
we sold no additional oc inventory in fiscal or however  we sold  and  of other previously written down inventory in fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal sales of previously written down inventory had a negligible impact on the fiscal gross margin as the inventory was sold for approximately its net book value 
goodwill our methodology for allocating a portion of the purchase price to goodwill in connection with the purchase of jasomi was based on established valuation techniques in the high technology communications equipment industry 
goodwill was measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized 
the goodwill recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of april  was million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
following the criteria of sfas disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  we view ditech as having a single operating segment and consequently have evaluated goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment based on an evaluation of the fair value of ditech as a whole 
ditech s quoted share price from nasdaq is the basis for measurement of that fair value as ditech s market capitalization based on share price best represents the amount at which ditech could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
accounting for stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based compensation plans at fair value 
we account for grants of equity instruments to employees using the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of ditech s stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock and is recognized over the vesting period of the related shares 
in fiscal  we recorded compensation expense related to the vesting of assumed stock options and the restricted stock grants made in connection with the june  acquisition of jasomi 
beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  we will begin to record compensation cost for stock based compensation plans at fair value in accordance with statement no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is discussed below 
cost of warranty at the time that we recognize revenue  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer hardware warranties on our products ranging from two to five years and one year software warranties 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product and provide software bug fixes within the term of the warranty 
our accrual for the estimated warranty is based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures  which would result in a decrease in gross profits 
as of april   we had recorded million of accruals related to estimated future warranty costs 
in general  we have been able to closely estimate the level of warranty exposure on our products  and the level of adjustment required to the reserve has been relatively insignificant 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences and our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at least once per quarter  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is no longer more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
beginning in fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance against our then existing deferred tax asset position was necessary 
we based this decision on the fact that in the fourth quarter of  we generated sufficient operating losses on a tax basis to fully recover all taxes paid in prior years 
in addition  our expectations of limited profitability  if any  due to the softness in the telecommunication industry during fiscal  combined with the significant tax losses generated by the sale of our echo cancellation software technology led us to conclude that the recovery of our deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not 
in the second quarter of  based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are deductible  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
we therefore released the valuation allowance of million in fiscal recent accounting pronouncements 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised share based payment sfas r which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  and  thus  will be effective for us beginning fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas no 
r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas r and sab on our financial position and results of operations 
see accounting for stock based compensation above for information related to the pro forma effects on our reported net income loss and net income loss per share of applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
it is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the effect of sfas will have material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued final staff position fsp and fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which nullify certain requirements of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
and supersede eitf topic no 
d the fsps provide guidance for identifying impaired investments and new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
we do not believe the impact of adoption of the measurement provisions of the fsps will have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations other income  net income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations gain loss on disposition income tax expense benefit from gain loss on disposition income loss from discontinued operations net income loss discussion of fiscal years ended april   and revenue years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands revenue change the decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a lack of orders from nextel  our second largest fiscal customer  and to a level of shipments to our largest fiscal customer  verizon  more consistent with historical shipments to them 
in december  nextel announced a plan to merge with sprint 
as a result of any merger  product purchases for network deployment may be reviewed  postponed or canceled based on revised plans for technology or network expansion for the merged entity 
we believe this is what has happened at nextel and  consequently  our fiscal revenue from nextel was nominal compared to of our total worldwide revenue  or million  in fiscal the increase in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely driven by increased shipments to our then two largest domestic wireless customers  verizon and nextel  as they continued to expand and update their networks  additional new customers and expansion into asia  latin america and canada 
in fiscal  our largest domestic wireless customer  verizon  accounted for of our total worldwide revenue 
in fiscal  our two largest domestic wireless customers accounted for of our total worldwide revenue 
in fiscal  our two largest domestic wireless customers accounted for of our revenue 
our second largest customer accounted for of our total worldwide revenue in fiscal while our third largest customer accounted for of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal in fiscal  sales of our broadband voice processor flex bvp flex accounted for of our revenue 
because the bvp flex provides increased flexibility and easier installation  it has been critical in helping us to acquire and retain our key domestic strategic customers  most prominently verizon 
in fiscal  we introduced our vqa product  which includes our new voice quality features and is primarily targeted at the international gsm market 
we expected the sales of vqa products to be higher in the last two fiscal years based on the number of customer trials in which we have been engaged 
while the revenue has been slow to materialize  we continue to believe that vqa presents material revenue opportunities  and we will therefore continue to invest in our international infrastructure and in customer trials 
in fiscal  million of our fourth quarter revenue was generated from international customers who  as noted  purchased the vqa platform  and we currently have revenue deferrals and orders from which we expect to generate million of international revenue in the first quarter of fiscal following the success of our bvp flex  revenue over the three fiscal years has been generated largely from domestic sales  which represented  and of our fiscal  and revenue  respectively 
as noted in the preceding paragraph  our international growth has primarily been dependent on our success in selling vqa 
while our success in selling to international markets has been limited so far  we expect that in the coming year  the international portion of our business will begin to grow as a percentage of overall sales as we begin to realize more sales of our vqa applications 
however  we expect that our domestic customers will continue to represent the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we expect revenue in the first quarter of fiscal to grow compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue for the remainder of fiscal will be dependent on our success in adding new customers domestically and internationally  the network technology and deployment plans of the north american telecommunication service providers and the market acceptance of our packet voice processor 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding forward looking statements such as the statements made in this and the prior two paragraphs about our expectations regarding our future revenue  as well as statements regarding our expectations in each of the categories below 
cost of goods sold years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cost of goods sold change cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  post sales installation costs  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal was primarily driven by the decrease in business volume as compared to fiscal however  cost of goods sold did not decrease in direct proportion to the decrease in sales due to the higher standard cost of the flex sales in fiscal relative to the standard cost of bvp flex sales in fiscal and higher service costs due to installations at our largest customer and one of our new international customers 
the flex combines echo cancellation technology with elements of our vqa suite of voice enhancement software to provide quality enhancement 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal  despite higher revenue  was primarily due to favorable customer and product mixes and a million reduction in the inventory provision  as substantially all of our older slower moving products were fully reserved as of the end of fiscal our inventory provisions recorded were   and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our analysis of gross profit below discusses the other factors driving changes in cost of goods sold 
gross margin 
years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands gross profit gross margin pts pts the primary reason for the percentage point decrease in gross margin in fiscal was the unfavorable customer and product mix  which included the impact of the higher standard cost of the flex sales relative to the standard cost of bvp flex and lower margin fiscal international sales  and higher service costs due to installations at our largest customer and one of our new international customers 
those unfavorable changes were partially offset by a combination of higher overhead utilization and lower manufacturing costs  lower standard product costs relative to fiscal and improved warranty and inventory obsolescence experience 
in fiscal  ditech sold  of previously written down inventory at approximately net book value 
the primary factor contributing to the percentage point increase in gross margin in fiscal was our favorable customer and product mix  as fiscal was heavily dominated by our bvp flex products  which have a higher overall gross margin than the products sold in fiscal shipments to our largest customer from fiscal had a somewhat lower margin than shipments to our largest customer in fiscal margins were also favorably impacted by the limited levels of excess and obsolete provisions  as virtually all of the product inventory identified as end of life near the end of fiscal was written down in fiscal leaving only minor levels of inventory other than our current qvp and bvp flex products 
partially offsetting the fiscal gross margin increases were lower sales of previously written down inventory 
in fiscal  we sold  of previously written down bvp and quad inventory compared to million of previously written down oc product in fiscal we expect gross margins in the next quarter to be approximately based on forecasted product and customer mix and the impact of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense under sfas r 
over the next several quarters  if we are successful in international deployment  we expect to experience pricing pressures as we expand the distribution of our products through value added resellers and distributors 
sales and marketing years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands sales and marketing expense of revenue pts pts sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
salary and related expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to employees acquired from jasomi  incremental hiring of international salespersons  hiring pre and post sales engineers to support a greater level of installation activity and the introduction of the packet voice processor  and the hiring of a new sales vice president 
salary and related costs included stock based compensation  convertible debenture amortization and other compensation expense associated with the jasomi acquisition discussed in more detail in acquisition related compensation expense below 
we incurred incremental costs of approximately  for participation in trade shows primarily showcasing our packet voice processor applications 
travel and related costs increased  over the prior year due to support required for international product evaluations of our vqa applications 
third party installation expense increased  compared to fiscal to support the great level of installation activity 
those increases were partially offset by an increase in absorption of service expenses to cost of sales of  due to installation support requirements at our largest customer 
we charge post sales service expenses for field and technical phone support to cost of sales and charge pre sales service expenses to sales and marketing expense 
amortization of demonstration and field units previously being used in customer demonstrations and trials declined by  in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we aggressively pursued the return of this equipment  which was previously being amortized  when customer demonstrations and trials were completed 
additionally  we reduced our competitor equipment purchases by  from time to time  depending on releases of new products  we may purchase competitor equipment to evaluate performance and features versus to our own products 
finally  primarily as a result of the renegotiation of our headquarters lease  we reduced facilities costs allocated to sales and marketing by  compared to fiscal salary and related costs increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to incremental hiring of international sales and pre sales support staff as well as domestic sales and pre sales support staff focused on specific domestic opportunities 
travel expense increased  in fiscal  primarily to support international product evaluations of our qvp based vqa products 
finally  outside service expenses increased  in fiscal to further support pre and post sales efforts in the field 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal due to selective headcount increases in sales  marketing and business development  deployment of more evaluation units primarily to drive demand for and support the voip products and the cost of agent fees as we sell more of our product internationally 
additionally  sales and marketing expense will increase in fiscal as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense under sfas r 
research and development 
years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands research and development expense of revenue pts pts research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  materials and supplies used in the development of voice processing products 
salary and related costs increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in spending was primarily associated with engineers hired as part of our acquisition of jasomi and our research and development efforts for our new packet based voice products 
our engineering staff grew to employees by the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal salary and related costs included the incremental salaries and stock based and convertible debenture amortization associated with the jasomi acquisition discussed in more detail in acquisition related compensation expense below 
depreciation  information technology related costs and maintenance on software and equipment used by the engineering departments accounted for an aggregate increase of million in fiscal due  in large part  to the increased demands from the larger engineering workforce needed to support our existing voice products  as well as our move into packet based voice products which required purchases of lab equipment 
travel related expense increased  for the year due to increased support of field trials and travel between our canada location and our california headquarters 
those increases were partially offset by decreases of million in outside service expense 
that expense declined based on our stage in packet voice processor development and our hiring of additional regular employees to complete the work 
additionally  facilities expense allocated to research and development declined  due to the renegotiation of our headquarters lease 
salary and related and prototype materials costs increased million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases in spending were primarily associated with the development of our new packet voice processor 
our engineering staff grew to employees by the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal additionally  depreciation  allocations of facilities and information technology related costs and maintenance on software and equipment used by the engineering departments increased million 
this was due  in large part  to the increased demands from a larger engineering workforce 
we expect modest increases in our research and development spending in fiscal as we have a full year of jasomi personnel and as we continue development of the packet voice processor 
additionally  research and development expense will increase in fiscal as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense under sfas r 
general and administrative years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands general and administrative expense of revenue pts pts general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
fiscal outside services for consulting and audit costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance and taxes declined million compared to fiscal  primarily because the workload was significantly less in the second year of sarbanes oxley compliance 
those reductions were offset by the cost of legal work related to the class action lawsuits  which resulted in an increase of  compared to fiscal the fiscal increases in general and administrative spending were largely due to increased consulting  professional service costs and audit fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance work and international expansion  which resulted in an aggregate increase in spending of over million 
additionally  bad debt expense was  lower in fiscal due to credits taken in fiscal for an adjustment to our bad debt reserve based on improved collection efforts 
there were no such adjustments to the reserve in fiscal we expect a slight increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal due to planned increases in variable compensation and audit related expenses 
additionally  general and administrative expense will increase in fiscal as a result of increased compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense under sfas r 
acquisition related compensation expense 
in fiscal  we recorded compensation expense related to the vesting of assumed stock options and the restricted stock grants made in connection with the june  acquisition of jasomi 
deferred stock based compensation represents the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of options assumed and restricted shares granted to jasomi employees and is amortized to research and development expense and sales and marketing expense over the corresponding vesting periods 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation charges included in operating expenses were as follows year ended april  s in thousands sales and marketing research and development total for the year ended april   we additionally recorded compensation expense related to the portion of convertible debentures issued to employee stockholders 
the compensation expense is being amortized to research and development expense and sales and marketing expense over the lives of the convertible debentures 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
convertible debenture amortization included in operating expenses was as follows year ended april  s in thousands sales and marketing research and development total amortization of purchased intangible assets 
for the year ended april   we recorded amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the jasomi acquisition 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to operating expense over their estimated useful life which ranges from four to five years

year ended april  s in thousands amortization of purchased intangible assets of revenue in process research and development 
year ended april  s in thousands in process research and development of revenue in fiscal  we incurred a charge for in process research and development in process r d acquired as part of our acquisition of jasomi 
the amount of the purchase price for jasomi allocated to in process r d was determined through established valuation techniques common in the high technology communications equipment industry 
in process r d is expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist 
in valuing in process r d  cash flows were based on estimates from our and jasomi s management and from various public  financial and industry sources 
we projected net revenue to grow through calendar and decline thereafter based on the rate of technology changes in the industry  product life cycles and various projects stages of development 
we estimated cost of goods sold and operating expenses  including research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue based on historical averages and forward looking projections 
we also included in the projections estimated costs to bring projects to technological feasibility and costs associated with activities undertaken to correct errors or keep products updated also referred to as maintenance research and development 
we based the tax expense on statutory federal and california tax rates 
we based the percentage of completion of in process projects on an averaging of expenses incurred to date compared to the total estimated development costs for each project  time incurred to date and remaining time to complete each project and milestone based percent complete estimates 
the in process projects pertained to general enhancements to peerpoint software  combining of nat and peering capability  increasing throughput capability  enhancing the interface and developing a denial of service module 
the average percentage complete for the in process projects was as of the date of the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  we estimated that these development efforts would be completed in nine months at an estimated cost of approximately  as of april   the remaining estimated cost to complete the project is approximately  primarily because the project to increase throughput capacity will be part of an integrated peerpoint and packet voice processor solution instead of a stand alone solution as originally planned 
the cost of capital used to discount estimated cash flows reflects the estimated time to complete the projects and the level of risk involved 
restructuring years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands restructuring of revenue pts pts the restructuring charge recognized in fiscal was attributable to the elimination of redundant general corporate level costs  personnel and facilities  which were impacted as a result of exiting the optical business  but did not qualify for inclusion in discontinued operations 
these costs included  of severance and related benefits and a loss provision associated with the abandonment of a portion of our mountain view facilities of  as a result  the fiscal year reflects a net loss provision of  related to our building and employee severance costs 
other income  net years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands other income  net of revenue pts pts other income  net consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalent and investment balances  offset by a nominal amount of foreign exchange losses 
the increase in other income  net in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to higher interest income  due to a significant improvement in the return on our invested cash 
the increase in fiscal compared to was also primarily attributable to higher interest income  due to our larger invested cash balance and an improvement in the return on our invested cash as interest rates began to increase 
our fiscal interest income will be dependent on our cash balances and the movement of us interest rates 
income taxes  continuing operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands income taxes  continuing operations of revenue pts pts income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the tax provision benefit for fiscal resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for the year was adversely affected by non deductible jasomi acquisition related charges  including our inability to deduct for tax purposes in process r d related to the acquisition of jasomi and convertible debenture amortization  and the correction of a million error in the balance of a deferred tax asset related to a california r d tax credit 
the error originated in the second quarter of fiscal at the time ditech released its valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and was corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal after conducting a thorough analytical review on materiality  which was brought to the attention of and discussed with the audit committee  management believes that such amounts are not material to previously reported financial statements 
those items were partially offset by the reversal of million of reserves on deferred tax assets primarily associated with a california r d tax credit position under audit by california s franchise tax board 
in april  ditech reached an agreement with the franchise tax board regarding its tax credit positions and consequently revised associated reserves 
the benefit in fiscal includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit related to our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit to continuing operations of million 
the recognition of the deferred tax assets had no impact on our fiscal cash flows 
partially offsetting the tax benefit recorded was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries and state and federal alternative minimum tax totaling  in fiscal the income taxes incurred in fiscal were due to providing alternative minimum taxes on our domestic operations 
we expect the effective tax rate to be at a more normalized rate of approximately in fiscal income loss from discontinued operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands loss from discontinued operations gain loss on disposition income tax expense benefit from gain loss on disposition income loss from discontinued operations of revenue pts pts the fiscal loss from discontinued operations includes remaining spending on optical communications marketing and development after our announcement to exit the optical business in may and the elimination of substantially all optical costs effective july as all operations related to our optical business ceased in fiscal  we did not have further losses from this discontinued operation in fiscal or in june  we came to a mutual settlement and release with jdsu whereby jdsu paid us  we had recorded receivables of  such that the net financial gain from the settlement was  as part of the settlement  jdsu additionally released us from our warranty obligation  which resulted in the release of  of our warranty liability 
in addition  in june  we completed the closure of our international optical operations and  as a result  reversed our remaining  of reserves related to the closure 
net of  of tax expense  the transactions resulted in a  gain from disposal of our discontinued operations 
this gain on disposition was not reflected in our press release of may  announcing our fiscal financial results  because the settlement had not occurred prior to that time 
the  gain on disposition in fiscal was due to adjustments needed to reflect actual costs incurred 
the loss on disposition in fiscal reflects the aggregate loss of million realized in the first quarter of fiscal upon the sale of the optical technology  inventory and certain fixed assets to jdsu  along with other exit costs associated with abandoning that portion of the optical business not acquired by jdsu 
subsequent adjustments to the loss resulted in an incremental loss of approximately  and were included in the total loss from disposal of our discontinued optical operations of million for fiscal in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have currently completed the wind up of our optical operations such that we expect no financial impact in fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  additionally  we had million of short term investments as of april  compared to million of short term investments as of april  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal cash flows from operating activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from operating activities our cash flow from operations generally follows our profitability trend of million  million inclusive of a non cash tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
through a combination of reducing accounts receivable and increasing deferred revenue  we generated million of cash in fiscal compared to fiscal  fiscal showed growth in accounts receivable  which increased due to somewhat unfavorable sales linearity in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and reductions in deferred revenue 
we expect to see positive cash flows from operations in the coming year based on projected revenue growth 
we expect  however  increases in accounts receivable as we sell more product internationally  as international customers typically have longer payment terms  and increases in operating expenses and inventory levels as we invest to grow our voip product sales 
cash flows from investing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from investing activities the change in cash flows from investing activities is due to three key events 
first  in fiscal  we changed our investing strategy to include short term and long term investments designed to improve our overall return on invested funds  which accounted for the majority of the cash used in fiscal and  but had little impact in fiscal as we had limited proceeds from operating and financing activities to invest in short term securities 
second  we used million of cash in fiscal to acquire jasomi see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
finally  partially offsetting our use of cash in fiscal was the collection of purchase price installments from the sale of our echo cancellation software technology of million and the collection of proceeds from the sale of our optical business of million 
in fiscal  we collected proceeds from the sale of our optical business and other minor sales of optical equipment of only  and in fiscal we had no proceeds from the optical business 
we plan to continue to invest in capital assets related to new product features and to support our efforts to sell our voip products 
in the first quarter of fiscal  million of the convertible debentures mature and will be paid in cash 
cash flows from financing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cash flow from financing activities the cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal was largely due to the repurchase of shares of common stock  as discussed below  partially offset by funds received from stock option exercises 
we repurchased no common stock in fiscal or stock option activity in fiscal and the first half of fiscal was particularly high following the trend in our stock price over that same period 
the limited level of option activity in fiscal was largely due to a large portion of the options being out of the money or only marginally in the money due to the decline in our stock price 
stock repurchase program in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a stock repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
consequently  we are not authorized to repurchase additional shares under the stock repurchase program 
the aggregate purchase price of the shares of our common stock repurchased was reflected as a reduction to shareholders equity 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins  we allocated the purchase price of the repurchased shares as a reduction to retained earnings  common stock and additional paid in capital 
commitments we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility leases  and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters 
in september  we renegotiated our mountain view  california lease  which extended the lease term through july  and reduced the rent cost 
we additionally have leased office space in calgary  canada  primarily for r d operations  under an operating lease expiring january  our contractual commitments  by year in which they become due  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year to years to years over years operating leases purchase commitments convertible notes total jasomi acquisition consideration included million in non transferable convertible notes  divided into two tranches with principal amounts of million and million  respectively 
the million notes mature on june   as no holder elected to extend or convert the notes 
ditech has not made any indemnification claims  nor have a sufficient number of designated employees left the employment of ditech to cause a reduction in the principal amounts of the notes  and so the full million of the first tranche of notes  plus interest accrued at  will be paid on or after june  upon surrender of the notes 
the million notes either mature or convert into ditech common stock at the election of the holder two years from the closing date 
the payment of the full million principal amount of the second tranche of convertible notes is contingent on the retention of a specified number of designated employees and the amount of any indemnification claims made by ditech for breaches of representations  warranties and covenants  and so is not reflected in the table above 
the notes bear an interest rate of  payable on maturity or conversion  and are convertible at per share 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next two years from our existing cash and short term investments 
we currently expect to renew our million line of credit  which expires in july the ability to fund our operations beyond the next two fiscal years will be dependent on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment 
should our customers significantly reduce their purchases of our products compared to current levels of purchases  we could need to find additional sources of cash during fiscal or be forced to reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are primarily maintained at four major financial institutions in the united states 
as of april   we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk  and we attempt to achieve this by diversifying our portfolio in a variety of highly rated investment securities that have limited terms to maturity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but current maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities  which management is able to liquidate on or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
short term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds and asset backed securities 
short term investments are maintained at three major financial institutions  are classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if we sell our short term investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
in fiscal  and  we realized no gains or losses on our short term investments
