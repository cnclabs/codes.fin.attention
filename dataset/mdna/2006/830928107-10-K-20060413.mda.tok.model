we account for software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

business outlook in the fiscal year ended january   we generated revenue of million  an increase of million compared to the revenue in the fiscal year ended january  of million  and we reported net income 
while we continue to find ourselves in a challenging business environment due to the overall market adoption rate for e learning solutions remaining relatively slow  budgetary constraints on it spending by our current and potential customers and price competition in the e learning market  we have seen some stability in the marketplace and our core business has performed in accordance with our expectations 
our recent revenue growth and our growth prospects are strongest in our product lines focused on informal learning  such as our booksx referenceware product line 
as a result  we have increased our sales and marketing investment in those areas to help capitalize on the recent growth and potential continued growth for informal learning 
we have also invested aggressively in research and development in those areas to accelerate the time by which our planned new products will be available to our customers 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we restructured our content development organization to more efficiently manage costs and capitalize further on the flexibility inherent in our existing outsourcing model 
the goal of the restructuring was to enable us to meet our existing content production targets at a reduced cost and with greater flexibility with respect to the product offerings in which we elect to make investments 
the restructuring involved the elimination of jobs in dublin  ireland and in nashua  new hampshire within our research and development organization as well as facilities consolidation in dublin 
we have shifted the remainder of our it skills content development activities to our outsourcing suppliers  while continuing to maintain project management and quality control internally 
this same restructuring included a reduction of an additional jobs in nashua  new hampshire for a rightsizing of our inside sales operation and jobs in germany related to the shutdown of our german facility 
as a result  we incurred restructuring charges related to payments to terminated employees  facilities consolidation and the repayment of grants previously awarded by irish agencies 
these charges totaled approximately million and were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe that the restructuring has resulted in content development cost savings of approximately million in fiscal  which afforded us more flexibility to reinvest in an outsourcing model for other research and development initiatives and to increase profitability of the organization 
in the first quarter of fiscal  in order to more fully focus on the multi modal learning mml business which includes informal learning  we sold certain assets of our retail it certification business  smartcertify the retail certification business 
the retail certification business was focused on direct to consumer business and contributed less revenue than expected 
this action has allowed us to fully focus our attention and resources on our core enterprise business 
we have maintained a reseller arrangement with the acquiring organization  and we also have maintained the existing customer contracts and will service those contracts until the contractual obligation is fulfilled 
we have been recognizing revenue from the deferred revenue balance related to direct to consumer business over the to months subsequent to the date of sale 
substantially all of the sales  marketing and administrative costs of our it retail certification business have been eliminated 
in fiscal  we plan to focus on revenue and earnings growth primarily through new customer acquisitions  continuing to execute on our new product and telesales distribution initiatives to provide new revenue streams  and a higher priority approach to produce a long term contribution from possible merger and acquisition opportunities 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  we believe the accounting policies described below are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying these policies  management uses its judgment in making certain assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the license of products and services and from providing hosting asp services 
we follow the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop to account for revenue derived pursuant to license agreements under which customers license our products and services 
the pricing for our courses varies based upon the number of course titles or the courseware bundle licensed by a customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement generally one  two or three years 
license agreements permit customers to exchange course titles  generally on the contract anniversary date 
additional product features  such as hosting and online mentoring services  are separately licensed for an additional fee 
the pricing for our product licenses varies based on the content offering selected by the customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement 
our product licenses provide customers access to a full range of learning products including courseware  referenceware  simulations  mentoring and prescriptive assessment 
a referenceware license gives users access to a full referenceware library within one or more referenceware collections examples of which include itpro  businesspro  financepro  engineeringpro  govessentials and officeessentials from books 
the pricing for our referenceware licenses varies based on the collections specified by a customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement 
we offer discounts from our ordinary pricing  and purchasers of licenses for larger numbers of courses  for larger user bases or for longer periods generally receive discounts 
generally  customers may amend their license agreements  for an additional fee  to gain access to additional courses or product lines and or to increase the size of the user base 
we also derive revenue from hosting fees for clients that use our solutions on an asp basis  online mentoring services and professional services 
in selected circumstances  we derive revenue on a pay for use basis under which some customers are charged based on the number of courses accessed by users 
revenue derived from pay for use contracts has been minimal to date 
we recognize revenue ratably over the license period if the number of courses that a customer has access to is not clearly defined  available  or selected at the inception of the contract  or if the contract has additional undelivered elements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the various elements 
this may occur if the customer does not specify all licensed courses at the outset  the customer chooses to wait for future licensed courses on a when and if available basis  the customer is given exchange privileges that are exercisable other than on the contract anniversaries  or the customer licenses all courses currently available and to be developed during the term of the arrangement 
nearly all of our contractual arrangements result in the recognition of revenue ratably over the license period 
we also derive revenue from extranet hosting asp services and online mentoring services 
we recognize revenue related to extranet hosting asp services and online mentoring services on a straight line basis over the period the services are provided 
we generally bill the annual license fee for the first year of a multi year license agreement in advance and license fees for subsequent years of multi year license arrangements are billed on the anniversary date of the agreement 
occasionally  we bill customers on a quarterly basis 
in some circumstances  we offer payment terms of up to six months from the initial shipment date or anniversary date for multi year license agreements to our customers 
to the extent that a customer is given extended payment terms defined by us as greater than six months  revenue begins to be recognized as cash becomes due  assuming all of the other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
we typically recognize revenue from resellers when both the sale to the end user has occurred and the collectibility of cash from the reseller is probable 
with respect to reseller agreements with minimum commitments  we recognize revenue related to the portion of the minimum commitment that exceeds the end user sales at the expiration of the commitment period provided we have received payment 
if a definitive service period can be determined  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the minimum commitment period  provided that cash has been received or collectibility is probable 
we also provide professional services including instructor led training  customized content  websites  and implementation services 
we recognize professional services revenue as the services are performed 
we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both maintenance and services revenues and as a direct cost of maintenances and services in accordance with eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
eitf requires reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred to be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
we record as deferred revenue amounts that have been billed in advance for products or services to be provided 
deferred revenue includes the unamortized portion of revenue associated with license fees for which we have received payment or for which amounts have been billed and are due for payment in days or less for resellers and days or less for direct customers 
in addition  deferred revenue includes amounts which have been billed and not collected for which revenue is being recognized ratably over the license period 
our contracts often include an uptime guarantee for solutions hosted on our server whereby customers would be entitled to credits in the event of nonperformance 
we also retain the right to remedy any nonperformance event prior to issuing a credit 
historically  we have not incurred substantial costs relating to this guarantee and we currently accrue for such costs as they are incurred 
we review these costs on a regular basis as actual experience and other information becomes available  and should they become more substantial  we would accrue an estimated exposure and consider the potential related effects of the timing of recording revenue on our license arrangements 
we have not accrued any costs related to these warranties in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill we record intangible assets as historical cost 
we amortize our intangible assets  which include customer contracts and internally developed software 
we review these intangible assets at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
we also review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment which includes trademarks and trade names 
we test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the test  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates 
share based compensation we account for our share based employee compensation plans on the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations under apb no 
we provide pro forma disclosures only of the compensation expense determined under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

see recent accounting pronouncements for a description of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment 
deferral of commissions we employ an accounting policy consistent with guidance provided by fasb technical bulletin accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts and sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition  related to the concept of a direct and incremental relationship between revenue and expense 
as such  we defer the recognition of commission expense until such time as the revenue related to the contract for which the commission was paid is recognized 
restructuring charges we account for our restructuring activities under guidance provided by sfas no 
sfas  business combinations eitf and sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas states that after the end of the allocation period generally one year from date of merger an adjustment that results from a pre acquisition contingency other than an income tax loss carryforward should be included in the determination of net income loss in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
as such  adjustments to pre acquisition contingencies established at the time of the smartforce skillsoft merger are recorded as restructuring charges in our statement of operations 
sfas states that a liability related to an exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value in the period in which it is incurred 
as such  when we identify restructuring charges that fulfill the requirements identified in sfas as incurred  we record the charges in our statement of income 
the most significant element for each of our restructuring charges incurred relates to lease abandonments 
in determining the fair value of liabilities associated with lease abandonments  we assess our contractual ability to sub lease the spaces currently under lease and obtain local independent professional assessments of current commercial real estate market conditions in those areas so that we can reasonably determine estimable sub lease income benefits 
furthermore  judgment is used in determining how to estimate long term restructuring costs 
generally the company uses a present value technique to estimate the fair value of a liability and discounts the expected cash flow associated with the restructuring activity using a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
legal contingencies in connection with any material legal proceedings that we may become involved in  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with our outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
in accordance with sfas no 
 gain contingencies are recorded at the time of realization 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the period in which related temporary differences become deductible 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change

comparison of the fiscal years ended january  and revenue the increase in revenue during the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to revenue generated from new business primarily derived from our product lines focused on informal learning  better than anticipated reseller revenues and a greater share of business having closed earlier in each of the respective quarterly periods for the fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  change in thousands revenue united states international total revenue increased by and in the united states and internationally  respectively  in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  change in thousands revenue multi modal learning retail certification total in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold certain assets related to smartcertify  our retail certification business 
the sale resulted in a reduction in revenue of million in our retail certification business for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the fiscal year ended january  the increase in our mml revenue is primarily due to revenue generated from new business primarily derived from our product lines focused on informal learning and better than anticipated reseller revenues 
we expect a reduction of approximately million in revenue in our retail certification business in fiscal when compared to fiscal we expect this decrease in revenue to be offset in fiscal by increased mml revenue generated from new business 
we exited the fiscal year ended january  with non cancelable backlog of approximately million as compared to million at january  this amount is calculated by combining the amount of deferred revenue at our fiscal year end with the amounts to be added to deferred revenue throughout the next twelve months as a result of committed customer contracts and determining how much of these amounts are scheduled to amortize into revenue during fiscal the amount scheduled to amortize into revenue during fiscal is disclosed as backlog as of january  amounts to be added to deferred revenue during fiscal include subsequent installment billings for ongoing contract periods as well as billings for new or continuing contracts 
as a result of the previously described sale of certain assets related to smartcertify the balance of non cancelable backlog at january  reflects a reduction of approximately million when compared to january  and smartcertify will not contribute new or continuing contracts during fiscal we have included this non gaap disclosure due to the fact that it is directly related to our subscription based revenue recognition policy 
this is a key business metric  which factors into our forecasting and planning activities and provides visibility into fiscal revenue 
costs and expenses the increase in cost of revenue in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to a higher mix of royalty bearing content due to the growth of our booksx referenceware product line 
the decrease in research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to the inclusion of million of purchased technology in fiscal and savings of million realized in fiscal as the result of the reorganization of our content development organization completed in the quarter ended january  this decrease was partially offset by the increased costs associated with outsourcing activity of million 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will be between and of revenue in fiscal the decrease in selling and marketing expenses in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to the expense reduction of million resulting from the sale of certain assets related to smartcertify  our retail certification business  at the end of our fiscal first quarter 
this was partially offset by incremental expenses incurred to support the new dialogue product line of million  new telesales distribution operation focusing on small and mid sized businesses of million and the additional investment in our books sales force of million 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will be between and of revenue in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of million  which included a million payment to howard edelstein  a director of the company  in recognition of mr 
edelstein s contributions to the company in connection with the settlements of our litigation with netg and our the securities class action litigation  which was partially offset by the expense reduction of million resulting from the sale of certain assets of smartcertify at the end of our fiscal first quarter 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will be between and of revenue in fiscal within legal settlements insurance recoveries  we received an insurance settlement of million in the fiscal year ended january   which resulted from the final settlement with our insurance carriers regarding the securities class action lawsuit settlement of million in march and the ongoing related litigation and sec investigation 
the settlement with our insurance carriers was partially offset by the settlement of a lawsuit with jody glidden  trish glidden and michael leblanc  who had previously opted out of the securities class action settlement  for approximately million on april  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we evaluated the fair value of goodwill 
in november of we hired an investment banker to actively market the retail certification segment to third party buyers 
however by january  the investment banker reported the efforts to sell the business were unsuccessful 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold certain assets and liabilities of the business in exchange for nominal consideration and the execution of a reseller agreement with the buyer 
in fiscal  we concluded that the retail certification segment had no goodwill and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the fiscal year ended january  in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed a restructuring of our retail certification business which resulted in a charge of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we evaluated the fair value of goodwill of the mml segment and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill 
the key assumptions utilized in the preparation of forecasted statements of operations for the mml segment  which reflect certain new initiatives  were as follows multi modal learning revenue compound annual growth of gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative other income expense million for all years working capital of gross revenue on january   we accelerated the vesting of all currently outstanding unvested stock options awarded to employees 
this vesting acceleration does not extend to any options held by executive officers and directors 
as a result of this action  we expect to avoid recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense in future periods beginning february   including approximately million of stock based compensation expense in the fiscal year ending january  we recorded a charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to expected forfeitures due to the acceleration of vesting of in the money options 
the decrease in restructuring expenses in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to the restructuring of our content development organization in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the closing of our german facility 
we did not incur any significant additional charges in fiscal as a result of this restructuring 
we do not anticipate any significant additional charges in fiscal as a result of these restructurings 
sec investigation charges decreased in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  due to a decrease in activity related to the ongoing sec investigation in which costs are expensed as incurred 
other professional fees in the fiscal year ended january  consisted primarily of the re filing of certain international tax returns and statutory financial statements as a result of the restatement 
we incurred no such charges in the fiscal year ended january  other expense income  net the change in other expense income  net in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations 
due to our multinational operations  our business is subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies used in our business 
gain loss on sale of assets  net we recorded a loss of  in the fiscal year ended january  this loss is primarily the result of investment banking and professional fees associated with the sale of certain assets of the retail certification business in the first quarter of fiscal interest income the increase in interest income in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to more funds being available for investment and higher interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
provision for income taxes the increase in the provision for income taxes in the fiscal year ended january  versus the fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to of the generation of higher taxable income in fiscal versus fiscal our effective tax rate of is significantly less than the combined federal and state tax rates primarily due to the fact that the million insurance recovery related to the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit recorded in fiscal was not taxable and to a lesser extent due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and income being earned in lower or no tax jurisdictions

the reduction in our working capital deficit was primarily due to our net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a non cash provision for income tax of million  million of proceeds from the exercise of share options and share purchases under our employee share purchase plan and the maturity of long term investments of million  which was partially offset by the repurchase of shares with a value of approximately million and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
we entered into a million two year  line of credit with a bank on july   which was amended in april under the terms of the line of credit  the bank holds a first security interest in all domestic business assets 
all borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the facility is subject to a commitment fee of  to secure the line of credit and unused commitment fees of based upon the daily average of un advanced amounts under the revolving line of credit 
we paid approximately  in unused commitment fees for the fiscal year ended january  in addition  the line of credit contains certain financial and non financial covenants 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants 
also  the line of credit provides that in the event of a material adverse change as defined in the line of credit  the lender has the ability to call amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
as of january   there were no borrowings on the line of credit  however  we had an outstanding letter of credit of million that reduced the availability under the line of credit 
letters of credit are subject to commission fees of as well as administrative costs 
we paid approximately  in letters of credit fees in the fiscal year ended january  as of january   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million 
these nols  which are subject to potential limitations based upon change in control provisions of section of the internal revenue code  are available to reduce future taxable income  if any  through we also had us federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million at january  additionally  we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions outside of the us if not utilized  these carryforwards expire at various dates through the year ending january  included in the million are approximately million of us net operating loss carryforwards and  of us tax credit carryforwards that were acquired in the merger and the purchase of books 
in addition  included in the million is approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions outside the us acquired in the merger and the purchase of books 
we will realize the benefits of these acquired net operating losses through reductions to goodwill and non goodwill intangibles during the period that the losses are utilized to reduce tax payments 
also included in the million at january   we have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in the united states resulting from disqualifying dispositions 
we will realize the benefit of these losses through increases to stockholder s equity in the periods in which the losses are utilized to reduce tax payments 
we lease certain of our facilities and certain equipment and furniture under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through future minimum lease payments  net of estimated rentals  under these agreements are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations we have no future contracted obligations related to long term debt  capital leases or purchase obligations 
we have a remaining payout to be made in the fiscal year ending january  of million relating to the settlement of the securities class action litigation described in note c of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have a payout to be made by april  of million to the plaintiffs relating to the settlement on april  described in note d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to experience similar spending related to capital expenditures in the fiscal year ending january   as compared to the fiscal year ended january   and we will continue to invest in our research and development and sales and marketing in order to execute our business plan and achieve expected revenue growth 
to the extent that our execution of the business plan results in increased sales  we expect to experience corresponding increases in deferred revenue  cash flow and prepaid expenses 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending january  are expected to be approximately million 
we purchased  shares under our shareholder approved repurchase plan during fiscal and this plan expired on march  with  shares available for repurchase under the original program 
our shareholders have approved the renewal and extension of the plan and as a result we currently have the ability to purchase  subject to certain limitations  up to  of our outstanding shares under the recently approved shareholder plan 
under the program  there are limitations on our ability to purchase shares up to this level  which include  but are not limited to  the availability of distributable profits under irish regulations and available cash 
we expect that the principal sources of funding for our operating expenses  capital expenditures  litigation settlement payments and other liquidity needs will be a combination of our available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which totaled approximately million as of january   and funds generated from future cash flows from operating activities 
we believe our current funds and expected cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  there are several items that may negatively impact our available sources of funds 
in addition  our cash needs may increase due to factors such as unanticipated developments in our business or significant acquisitions 
the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon the successful execution of our business plan 
although we do not foresee the need to raise additional capital  any unanticipated economic or business events could require us to raise additional capital to support operations 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r is effective for the first quarter of the first fiscal year that begins after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we adopted statement r on february  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have determined to utilize the modified prospective method to use in adopting sfas r 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we expect share based compensation expense to be approximately million to million for the fiscal year ending january  however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our share price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our share price and employee share option exercise behaviors 
in addition  compensation expense could increase to the extent additional share options are granted in the future 
the adoption of sfas r will have no material impact on our net cash flows 
on january  we accelerated the vesting of all currently outstanding unvested stock options awarded to employees 
this vesting acceleration does not extend to any options held by executive officers and directors 
as a result of this action we expect to avoid recognition of approximately million of stock based compensation expense in future periods beginning february   including approximately million of stock based compensation expense in the fiscal year ending january  we recorded a charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to expected forfeitures due to the acceleration of vesting of in the money options 
the fasb recently issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas  which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle 
apb previously required that such a change be reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas carries forward many provisions of apb without change  including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in accounting estimate  a change in the reporting entity  and the correction of an error 
sfas also carries forward the provisions of sfas that govern reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  sfas does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of sfas we currently believe that the adoption of sfas will have no impact on our results of operations 
explanation of use of non gaap financial results in addition to our audited financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  to assist investors we may on occasion provide certain non gaap financial results as an alternative means to explain our periodic results 
the non gaap financial results typically exclude non cash or one time charges or benefits 
our management uses the non gaap financial results internally as an alternative means for assessing our results of operations 
by excluding non cash charges such as stock based compensation  amortization of purchased intangible assets  impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  management can evaluate our operations excluding these non cash charges and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in our industry 
by excluding charges such as restructuring charges benefits  our management can compare our ongoing operations to prior quarters where such items may be materially different and to ongoing operations of other companies in our industry who may have materially different one time charges 
our management recognizes that non gaap financial results are not a substitute for gaap results  and believes that non gaap measures are helpful in assisting them in understanding and managing our business 
our management believes that the non gaap financial results may also provide useful information to investors 
non gaap results may also allow investors and analysts to more readily compare our operations to prior financial results and to the financial results of other companies in the industry who similarly provide non gaap results to investors and analysts 
investors may seek to evaluate our business performance and the performance of our competitors as they relate to cash 
excluding one time and non cash charges may assist investors in this evaluation and comparisons 
we intend to continue to assess the potential value of reporting non gaap results consistent with applicable rules and regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk our general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we currently use a registered investment manager to place our investments in highly liquid money market accounts and government backed securities 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on the short term nature of our investments  we have concluded that there is no significant market risk exposure 
foreign currency risk due to our multinational operations  our business is subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues or pay expenses and the us dollar 
our expenses are not necessarily incurred in the currency in which revenue is generated  and  as a result  we are required from time to time to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
these currency conversions are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  in particular changes to the value of the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar  new zealand dollar  singapore dollar  and pound sterling relative to the us dollar  which could adversely affect our business and the results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we incurred foreign currency exchange gains losses of   and  respectively
