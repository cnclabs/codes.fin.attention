critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows allowance for loan losses the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
arriving at an appropriate amount of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company makes use of two types of allowances for loan losses specific and general 
a specific allowance may be assigned to a loan that is considered to be impaired 
loan impairment is determined based upon management s identification and evaluation of problem loans and is recognized when the company deems that the timely collection of all principal and or interest payments that are contractually due is no longer assured 
judgment is required as to the timing of designating a loan as impaired and the amount of the required specific allowance 
management s judgment is based upon its assessment of probability of default  loss given default and exposure at default 
changes in these estimates could be due to a number of circumstances which may have a direct impact on the provision for loan losses and may result in changes to the amount of allowance 
the general allowance is determined based upon management s judgment and its amount is dependent upon the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen  as well as historical and expected loss information  loan portfolio composition and other relevant indicators 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and is reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see the allowance for loan loss and provision for loan loss sections within the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation to follow 
income taxes the company estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note  income taxes within notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing authorities in the current year 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
deferred tax assets liabilities represent differences between when a tax benefit or expense is recognized for book purposes and on the company s tax return 
future tax assets are assessed for recoverability 
the company would record a valuation allowance if it believes based on available evidence  that it is more likely than not that the future tax assets recognized will not be realized before their expiration 
the amount of the future income tax asset recognized and considered realizable could be reduced if projected income is not achieved due to various factors such as unfavorable business conditions 
if projected income is not expected to be achieved  the company would record a valuation allowance to reduce its future tax assets to the amount that it believes can be realized in its future tax returns 
the company has no recorded tax valuation allowance as of december  additionally  deferred tax assets liabilities are calculated based on tax rates expected to be in effect in future periods 
previously recorded tax assets and liabilities need to be adjusted when the expected date of the future event is revised based upon current information 
valuation of goodwill intangible assets and analysis for impairment independent bank corp 
in part has increased its market share through the acquisition of entire financial institutions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  as well as from the acquisition of financial institution s branches not the entire institution 
for acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method and the acquisition of financial institution branches  the company is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value which is an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
these valuation estimates result in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests and is evaluated using various fair value techniques including multiples of price equity and price earnings ratios 
as a result of such impairment testing conducted in the company determined goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents executive level overview the company s results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the results of operations are also affected by the level of income fees from loans  deposits  mortgage banking  and investment management activities  as well as operating expenses  the provision for loan losses  the impact of federal and state income taxes  and the relative levels of interest rates and economic activity 
the company reported earnings of million for the year ended december  representing growth of from the same period last year 
earnings growth in was primarily due to targeted loan growth funded with strong growth in deposits 
the company also experienced growth in the core non interest income categories of deposit service charges  mortgage banking revenue  and improved revenue from our wealth management business due to growth in managed assets 
the company s net interest margin remained stable in due to a number of management initiatives 
non interest expense increased by primarily due to normal increases in salaries and benefits as well as expenses associated with two new branch locations and the full year impact of the falmouth bancorp  inc acquisition 
management has focused on earning asset growth in the high value segments of commercial lending and variable rate home equity lines of credit  while placing less emphasis on indirect auto  portfolio residential lending and the securities portfolio 
while this strategy has slowed balance sheet growth  management believes it is prudent in the current interest rate environment 
the securities portfolio has decreased on both a relative basis as a percent of earning assets as well as on an actual basis  reflecting good loan growth and the current flat yield curve environment see definition below which management believes not to be conducive to growing the securities portfolio 
the following graph depicts the historical us treasury yield curve as of december  for the years historical us treasury yield curve line graph a yield curve is a graphic line chart that shows interest rates at a specific point for all securities having equal risk  but different maturity dates 
a flat yield curve is one in which there is little difference between short term and long term rates for bonds of the same credit quality 
when short and long term bonds are offering equivalent yields  there is usually little benefit in holding the longer term instruments that is  the investor does not gain any excess compensation for the risks associated with holding longer term securities 
for example  a flat yield curve on us treasury securities would be one in which the yield on a two year bond is and the yield on a year bond is

generally  the actual maturity of loans is substantially shorter than their contractual maturity due to prepayments and  in the case of real estate loans  due on sale clauses  which generally gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that  among other things  the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of real estate loans tends to increase when current real estate loan rates are higher than rates on mortgages in the portfolio and  conversely  tends to decrease when rates on mortgages in the portfolio are higher than current real estate loan rates 
under the latter scenario  the weighted average yield on the portfolio tends to decrease as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
due to the fact that the bank may  consistent with industry practice  roll over a significant portion of commercial and commercial real estate loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing the loans on substantially similar or revised terms  the principal repayments actually received by the bank are anticipated to be significantly less than

asset quality rockland trust company actively manages all delinquent loans in accordance with formally drafted policies and established procedures 
in addition  rockland trust company s board of directors reviews delinquency statistics  by loan type  on a monthly basis 
delinquency the bank s philosophy toward managing its loan portfolios is predicated upon careful monitoring which stresses early detection and response to delinquent and default situations 
the bank seeks to make arrangements to resolve any delinquent or default situation over the shortest possible time frame 
generally  the bank requires that a delinquency notice be mailed to a borrower upon expiration of a grace period typically no longer than days beyond the due date 
reminder notices and telephone calls may be issued prior to the expiration of the grace period 
if the delinquent status is not resolved within a reasonable time frame following the mailing of a delinquency notice  the bank s personnel charged with managing its loan portfolios  contacts the borrower to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for payment 
any subsequent actions taken to resolve the delinquency will depend upon the nature of the loan and the length of time that the loan has been delinquent 
the borrower s needs are considered as much as reasonably possible without jeopardizing the bank s position 
a late charge is usually assessed on loans upon expiration of the grace period 
on loans secured by one to four family  owner occupied properties  the bank attempts to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure action 
if such efforts do not result in a satisfactory arrangement  the loan is referred to legal counsel whereupon counsel initiates foreclosure proceedings 
at any time prior to a sale of the property at foreclosure  the bank may and will terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work out a satisfactory payment plan 
on loans secured by commercial real estate or other business assets  the bank similarly seeks to reach a satisfactory payment plan so as to avoid foreclosure or liquidation

delinquencies have increased year over year mainly due to two commercial real estate credits and one residential real estate loan  all of which the company believes to be adequately collateralized 
the increase in consumer delinquency is generally a result of the recent changes in bankruptcy laws 
nonaccrual loans as permitted by banking regulations  consumer loans and home equity loans past due days or more continue to accrue interest 
in addition  certain commercial and real estate loans that are more than days past due may be kept on an accruing status if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
as a general rule  a commercial or real estate loan more than days past due with respect to principal or interest is classified as a nonaccrual loan 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccrual loans and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current income 
a loan remains on nonaccrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest and in certain instances remains current for up to three months  when the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible it is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans  nonperforming securities and other real estate owned oreo

a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the bank does not separately identify individual  consumer  or residential loans for impairment disclosures

federal reserve regulators examined the company in the third quarter of and the bank was most recently examined by the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  in the first quarter of no additional provision for loan losses was required as a result of these examinations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses based upon evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio

allocated allowances increased by approximately million to million at december  increased amounts of allowance were allocated to five major loan categories commercial real estate  business banking  real estate construction  consumer home equity  and consumer other 
the increased amounts allocated to these loan categories represented substantially all of the increase in the allocated allowance amounts  as compared to december  decreased allowances were posted in commercial industrial  residential real estate  and consumer auto  due mainly to a lower level of outstanding loan balances from the end of the decrease of in allowance allocated to the commercial and industrial category is attributed to the risk rating changes of certain loan balances and to portfolio turnover 
additionally  those loan balances in certain commercial and industrial loan groupings that have been repaid were replaced by newly originated loan balances that have been placed into other loan groupings within this loan category that require different levels of allocated allowance based upon the ascertainable risk characteristics of those loans 
the decrease in the amount of allowance allocated to the consumer auto loan category of reflects a decrease in loan balances  from december  to december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial real estate category is due to loan balance growth within this loan category attributed to new loan origination and risk rating changes of certain loan balances 
loan balances outstanding in this portfolio  at december   increased by  while the amount of allowance allocated to this portfolio grew by  as compared to december  the amount of allowance allocated reflects increases in loan balances distributed among certain loan types within commercial real estate that require different levels of allocated allowance based upon the ascertainable risk characteristics of those loans

allocated allowance for loan losses are determined using both a formula based approach applied to groups of loans and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment 
the formula based approach evaluates groups of loans to determine the allocation appropriate within each portfolio section 
individual loans within the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan portfolio sections are assigned internal risk ratings to group them with other loans possessing similar risk characteristics 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by management applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss inherent in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past experience and management s analysis of considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
during the quarter ended march   enhancements to the bank s internal risk rating framework were implemented 
these enhancements refine the definitional detail of the risk attributes and characteristics that compose each risk grouping and add granularity to the assessment of credit risk across those defined risk groupings 
allocations for business banking  residential real estate and other consumer loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of probable or expected losses inherent in those categories 
in each section  inherent losses are estimated  based on a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past loan loss experience and management s considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
the other method used to allocate allowances for loan losses entails the assignment of allowance amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the bank will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method  loans are selected for evaluation based 
table of contents upon a change in internal risk rating  occurrence of delinquency  loan classification or non accrual status 
a specific allowance amount is allocated to an individual loan when such loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is able to be estimated on the basis of a the present value of anticipated future cash flows or on the loan s observable fair market value or b the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans with a specific allowance and the amount of such allowance totaled  and  respectively  at december  and million and  respectively  at december  a portion of the allowance for loan loss is not allocated to any specific section of the loan portfolio 
this non specific allowance is maintained for two primary reasons a 
there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed and b 
the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
moreover  management has identified certain risk factors  which could impact the degree of loss sustained within the portfolio 
these include a 
market risk factors  such as the effects of economic variability on the entire portfolio  and b 
unique portfolio risk factors that are inherent characteristics of the bank s loan portfolio 
market risk factors may consist of changes to general economic and business conditions that may impact the bank s loan portfolio customer base in terms of ability to repay and that may result in changes in value of underlying collateral 
unique portfolio risk factors may include industry concentration or covariant industry concentrations  geographic concentrations or trends that may exacerbate losses resulting from economic events which the bank may not be able to fully diversify out of its portfolio 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and ever changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the bank s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management  therefore  has established and maintains an imprecision allowance for loan losses reflecting the uncertainty of future economic conditions within the bank s market area 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was million at december  inflationary concerns resulting from higher energy and commodity prices  potential downward pressure on housing prices  fluctuating interest rates  and changes in the level of employment are just some of the drivers that could impact local and regional economic growth and the banking environment in the near term 
unforeseen changes in the economy can impact the risk characteristics of the bank s loan portfolio 
as such  management maintains the imprecision allowance based on its analysis of regional and local economic conditions 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million as compared to million at december  based on the processes described above  management believes that the level of the allowance for possible loan losses at december  is adequate

risk management the company s board of directors and executive management have identified seven significant risk categories consisting of credit  interest rate  liquidity  operations  compliance  reputation and strategic risk 
the board of directors has approved a risk management policy that addresses each category of risk 
the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief technology and operations officer  the senior lending officer and other members of management provide regular reports to the board of directors that review the level of risk to limits established by the risk management policy and other policies approved by the board of directors that address risk and any key risk issues and plans to address these issues 
asset liability management the bank s asset liability management process monitors and manages  among other things  the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet  the composition of the securities portfolio  funding needs and sources  and the liquidity position 
all of these factors  as well as projected asset growth  current and potential pricing actions  competitive influences  national monetary and fiscal policy  and the regional economic environment are considered in the asset liability management process 
the asset liability management committee alco  whose members are comprised of the bank s senior management  develops procedures consistent with policies established by the board of directors  which monitor and coordinate the bank s interest rate sensitivity and the sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and its effect on earnings 
if assets and liabilities do not re price simultaneously and in equal volume  the potential for interest rate exposure exists 
it is management s objective to maintain stability in the growth of net interest income through the maintenance of an appropriate mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and  when necessary  within prudent limits  through the use of off balance sheet hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps  floors and caps 
the committee employs simulation analyses in an attempt to quantify  evaluate  and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income 
in addition  the bank engages an independent consultant to render advice with respect to asset and liability management strategy 

table of contents the bank is careful to increase deposits without adversely impacting the weighted average cost of those funds 
accordingly  management has implemented funding strategies that include fhlb advances and repurchase agreement lines 
these non deposit funds are also viewed as a contingent source of liquidity and  when profitable lending and investment opportunities exist  access to such funds provides a means to leverage the balance sheet 
from time to time  the bank has utilized interest rate swap agreements and interest rates caps and floors as hedging instruments against interest rate risk 
an interest rate swap is an agreement whereby one party agrees to pay a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount in exchange for receiving a fixed rate of interest on the same notional amount for a predetermined period of time from a second party 
interest rate caps and floors are agreements whereby one party agrees to pay a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount for a predetermined period of time to a second party if certain market interest rate thresholds are realized 
the assets relating to the notional principal amount are not actually exchanged 
at december  the company had interest rate swaps  designated as cash flow hedges  with total notional values of million 
the purpose of these swaps is to hedge the variability in the cash outflows of libor based borrowings attributable to changes in interest rates 
under these swap agreements the company pays a fixed rate of interest of on million notional value through november   on million notional value through january   and on million through january   and all receive month libor rate of interest 
these swaps had a positive fair value of million at december  the company also has a million  month libor interest rate cap with an effective date of january  and a maturity date of january  the interest rate cap pays the company when month libor exceeds on a rate reset date during the effective period of the cap

at december  the company had interest rate swaps with a value of million 
under these swap agreements the company pays a fixed rate of interest of on million of the notional value through november  and on the remaining million notional value through january  and both receive a month libor rate of interest 
these swaps had a positive fair value of  at december  all changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded  net of tax  through equity as other comprehensive income 
to improve the company s asset sensitivity  the company sold interest rate swaps hedged against loans during the year ending december  resulting in total deferred gains of million 
the deferred gain is classified in other comprehensive income  net of tax  as a component of equity

market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
the company has no trading operations and thus is only exposed to non trading market risk 
interest rate risk is the most significant non credit risk to which the company is exposed 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates  as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of assets and liabilities  affect net interest income  the company s primary source of revenue 
interest rate risk arises directly from the company s core banking activities 
in addition to directly impacting net interest income  changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the amount of loans originated  the timing of cash flows on loans and securities and the fair value of securities and derivatives as well as other affects 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board 
these limits reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying  quantifying and  where appropriate  hedging its exposure 
the company manages its interest rate exposure using a combination of on and off balance sheet instruments  primarily fixed rate portfolio securities  and interest rate swaps 
the company quantifies its interest rate exposures using net interest income simulation models  as well as simpler gap analysis  and economic value of equity eve analysis 
key assumptions in these simulation analyses relate to behavior of interest rates and behavior of the company s deposit and loan customers 
the most material assumptions relate to the prepayment of mortgage assets including mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities and the life and sensitivity of nonmaturity deposits eg dda  now  savings and money market 
the risk of prepayment tends to increase when interest rates fall 
since future prepayment behavior of loan customers is uncertain  the resultant interest rate sensitivity of loan assets cannot be determined exactly 
to mitigate these uncertainties  the company gives careful attention to its assumptions 
in the case of prepayment of mortgage assets  assumptions are derived from published dealer median prepayment estimates for comparable mortgage loans 
the company manages the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage banking operations by entering into forward sales contracts 
an increase in market interest rates between the time the company commits to terms on a loan and the time the company ultimately sells the loan in the secondary market will have the effect of reducing the gain or increasing the loss the company records on the sale 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by entering into forward sales commitments in amounts sufficient to cover all closed loans and a majority of rate locked loan commitments 
the company s policy on interest rate risk simulation specifies that if interest rates were to shift gradually up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the subsequent months should decline by less than 
given the unusually low rate environments at december   the company assumed a basis point decline in interest rates in addition to the normal basis point increase in rates 
the company was well within policy limits at december  and the company s earnings are not directly and materially impacted by movements in foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
movements in equity prices may have an indirect but modest impact on earnings by affecting the volume of activity or the amount of fees from investment related business lines 
the following table sets forth the estimated effects on the company s net interest income over a month period following the indicated dates in the event of the indicated increases or decreases in market interest rates table interest rate sensitivity basis point basis point basis point rate increase rate decrease rate decrease december  n a december  n a 
table of contents the results implied in the above table indicate estimated changes in simulated net interest income for the subsequent months assuming a gradual shift up or down in market rates of and basis points across the entire yield curve 
it should be emphasized  however  that the results are dependent on material assumptions such as those discussed above 
for instance  asymmetrical rate behavior can have a material impact on the simulation results 
if competition for deposits forced the company to raise rates on those liabilities quicker than is assumed in the simulation analysis without a corresponding increase in asset yields net interest income may be negatively impacted 
alternatively  if the company is able to lag increases in deposit rates as loans re price upward net interest income would be positively impacted 
the most significant factors affecting market risk exposure of the company s net interest income during were i changes in the composition and prepayment speeds of mortgage assets and loans ii the shape of the us government securities and interest rate swap yield curve iii the level of us prime interest rates and iv the level of rates paid on deposit accounts 
the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and debt obligations

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the financial nature of the company s consolidated financial statements is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
however  inflation does affect the company because  as prices increase  the money supply grows and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
the impact on the company is a noted increase in the size of loan requests with resulting growth in total assets 
in addition  operating expenses may increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation
