overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and markets prescription and over the counter products in selected markets 
on august   we purchased certain assets of bioglan pharmaceuticals  a wholly owned subsidiary of quintiles transnational corp 
as part of the transaction  we acquired certain intellectual property  regulatory filings  and other assets relating to solaraze  a topical treatment indicated for the treatment of actinic keratosis  adoxa  an oral antibiotic indicated for the treatment of acne  zonalon  a topical treatment indicated for pruritus  tx systems  a line of advanced topical treatments used during in office procedures  and certain other dermatologic products 
the total consideration was approximately million  including acquisition costs 
in connection with this acquisition  we hired certain sales representatives and other personnel of bioglan and entered into a million bridge loan  which replaced our then existing credit facility 
we funded the purchase price for the acquisition through the proceeds of the bridge loan and working capital 
on september   we replaced the bridge loan with a million credit facility the old facility  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
on november   we replaced this million old facility with a new million facility the new facility  consisting of an million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
concurrently with the closing of this million new facility  we repaid all amounts due under our senior subordinated convertible notes the notes and the related indenture the indenture  including all default interest and other payments  and paid all fees and expenses in connection with the new facility 
the new facility s term loan and revolver both mature on november  and are secured by a lien upon substantially all of our assets  including those of our subsidiaries  and is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
the new facility was subsequently amended on january  and may   as described below 
our doak dermatologics subsidiary promotes our branded dermatologic and podiatric products  including our keralac tm  zoderm  lidamantle  rosula and selseb product lines  and our bioglan pharmaceuticals subsidiary promotes our branded dermatologic and podiatric products  including our adoxa  solaraze and zonalon product lines  to dermatologists and podiatrists in the united states through its dedicated sales force of representatives as of may  our kenwood therapeutics division promotes our branded gastrointestinal products  including anamantle hc  pamine  pamine forte and flora q to gastroenterologists and colon and rectal surgeons in the united states through its dedicated sales force of more than representatives as of may  to a lesser extent  kenwood therapeutics also markets nutritional supplements and respiratory products 
we derive a majority of our net sales from our core branded products adoxa  keralac tm  solaraze  zoderm  lidamantle  rosula  selseb  zonalon  pamine  anamantle hc  flora q and glutofac zx 
these core branded products accounted for a total of approximately of our net sales for and approximately of our net sales for adoxa  solaraze and zonalon were acquired by us during 
we have experienced an increase in generic competition occurring in the fourth quarter and during against many of our products  including some adoxa  keralac tm  zoderm  lidamantle  rosula  and anamantle hc products 
as a result of generic competition  the execution of distribution and service agreements with two wholesale customers in and a change in these customers market dynamics  we experienced an increase in product returns from our customers 
in december  we were advised by the staff of the sec that it is conducting an informal inquiry to determine whether there have been violations of the federal securities laws 
in connection with the inquiry  the sec staff has requested that we provide it with certain information and documents  including with respect to revenue recognition and capitalization of certain payments 
we are cooperating with this inquiry  however  we are unable at this point to predict the final scope or outcome of the inquiry 
we are also party to a federal securities class action lawsuit and federal and state shareholder derivative lawsuits which have arisen as a consequence of the sec inquiry and restatement of our financial results for the quarter ended september  on january   we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with medigene ag 
under the agreement  medigene has granted us the exclusive license  or sublicense in certain instances  to certain patents  trademarks and other intellectual property for our use in the commercialization  in the united states  as a prescription product  of any ointment or other topical formulation containing green tea catechins  developed pursuant to our agreement with medigene  for the treatment of dermatological diseases in humans  including but not limited to external genital warts  perianal warts and actinic keratosis 
in the first quarter  the company paid to medigene  in consideration for development and registration activities undertaken prior to the date of the agreement 
the company will expense the million research and development payment during the first quarter restatement of previously issued financial statements for the quarter ended september  the restatement of the previously issued financial statements for the quarter ended september  was a result of a transaction previously recorded as a sale not meeting the criteria for being a sale 
the transaction consisted of a sale of approximately million of deconamine syrup shipped and paid for in the third quarter the previously recorded sale was modified after the customer expressed its intentions to return the product in that we would accept all unsold product as of february   with credit granted against other trade amounts owed by the customer 
as a result of the non recognition of the transaction as a sale  our consolidated statement of income for the third quarter was adjusted and restated to reduce net sales by  to  net income by  to  and diluted net income per common share by to and our consolidated balance sheet as of september  was adjusted and restated to record  of deferred revenue 
we subsequently restated our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   which we filed with the sec on january  all amounts referenced in this annual report reflect the relevant amounts on a restated basis 
the originally issued financial statements for the quarter ended september  should no longer be relied upon

bioglan net sales for were  representing an increase of  or  from  for the increase was primarily due to the bioglan results being a partial period last year and the new product sales of adoxa mg  launched in the fourth quarter  of  net sales during were negatively impacted by primarily the following an increase in generic or therapeutically equivalent products competing on price 
in particular  was negatively impacted by the introduction of generic competition for carmol fourth quarter  anamantle hc fourth quarter  lidamantle and lidamantle hc fourth quarter  anamantle hc cream kit first quarter  keralac tm gel and lotion first quarter  zoderm second quarter  rosula aqueous gel and rosula aqueous cleanser second quarter  keralac tm cream third quarter and adoxa mg and mg fourth quarter 
as a result of the generic competition noted above  we expect our future sales of the above products to be negatively impacted by generic or therapeutically equivalent products 
we entered into dsas with our two largest wholesale customers with effective dates covering we and the wholesale customers agreed that the wholesale customers would maintain lower inventory quantities than they had on hand 
as a result  the dsas contributed to decreased net sales due to reduced purchases of our products and increased product returns 
previous to  major drug wholesalers and some chain drug stores bought and sold with each other in order to take advantages of selling and buying pharmaceutical products below the pharmaceutical companies wholesale prices 
these lower prices were available due to the drug wholesalers speculative buying before price increases  creating lower cost inventory in comparison to pharmaceutical companies then existing wholesale prices 
with the goal of eliminating any possible counterfeit drugs  the wholesalers now have certain pedigree requirements in their sourcing of drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies  and therefore  they have substantially eliminated buying and selling among drug wholesalers 
chain drug stores have also implemented the same programs 
in particular  in addition to the increase in generic competition noted above  our sales to quality king decreased as a result of its decrease in potential resale locations 
as noted above  some of the increases in our net sales for were the result of new product launches 
further  some of the new product sales were the result of initial stocking sales  which  historically  have resulted in reduced product sales for subsequent quarters 
as of december   we had  of orders on backorder as a result of us being out of stock  which were subsequently shipped and recognized in the first quarter we estimate our prescription demand  net of charges against sales  based upon information received from wolters kluwer  for  to be approximately million 
our prescription net sales recorded during was approximately million  which includes initial stocking by our customers for newly launched products 
the approximate million difference between the prescription demand and our recorded net sales for is primarily due to our wholesale customers decreasing their inventory of our products in accordance with the dsas and the substantial elimination of buying and selling among drug wholesalers 
the following table summarizes the changes in the return reserve during and year return reserve at january   product returns during  acquired bioglan return reserve  provision  return reserve at december   year return reserve at january   product returns during  provision  return reserve at december   during the fourth quarter of  we increased our return reserve provision by approximately  primarily due to an increase in our estimated inventory of our products at the wholesalers and retailers as a result of additional actual product return experience in the first four months of and an increase in the rate of return for certain products 
this resulted in an increase to the return reserve accrual by approximately as of december   based upon wholesale inventory reports and discussions with retail chains and wholesalers  we estimate the total monthly inventory of our products at the wholesalers and retailers to be months 
after applying the december  return reserve  we estimate the unreserved monthly inventory of our products at the wholesalers and retailers to be 
months 
we recorded  in the fourth quarter  an increase in our reserves for charges against sales  primarily relating to returns 
the increase in the returns portion of this reserve was a result  among other factors  of the execution during of the dsas with two wholesale customers which became effective during  our obtaining customer inventory data from our four largest customers during the fourth quarter and first quarter  a change in these customers market dynamics becoming evident during  our having subsequent return visibility relating to and prior during  and our having increased generic competition occurring in the fourth quarter and during the increase in our reserves for charges against sales  primarily relating to returns  as discussed in note m of this annual report of form k  was  there is no proprietary protection for most of our products  and therefore our products face competition from generic or comparable products that are sold by other pharmaceutical companies 
increased competition from the sale of generic or comparable products may cause a decrease in net sales from our products 
if net sales of keralac tm  adoxa  solaraze  zoderm  rosula  anamantle hc  pamine or other of our products decline  as a result of increased competition  government regulations  wholesaler buying patterns  returns  physicians prescribing habits or for any other reason and we fail to replace those net sales  our net sales and profitability would decrease

the bioglan net sales for the period from the purchase date through december  were  which were comprised of net sales of adoxa of  solaraze of  zonalon of  and other products of  bioglan net sales during the period were negatively impacted by lower wholesaler purchases as wholesalers reduced their inventory levels 
the overall increase in the sales and new product sales  excluding sales as a result of initial stocking related to zoderm products  keralac tm products  rosula ns  anamantle hc cream kit s and selseb shampoo for  were primarily due to promotional efforts  including an increase in the number of sales representatives detailing those products to high potential physicians 
initial stocking sales from zoderm products in the first quarter and third quarter  keralac tm lotion and gel in the second quarter  rosula ns in the third quarter and selseb shampoo and anamantle hc cream kit s in the fourth quarter significantly contributed to the increased sales in comparison to last year 
as a result of certain zoderm products sales initially stocked by our customers during the first quarter  zoderm sales during second quarter  third quarter and fourth quarter were less than the first quarter in addition  as a result of certain other zoderm products and rosula ns being initially stocked by our customers during the third quarter  sales of those products during the fourth quarter were significantly less than the third quarter further  as a result of anamantle hc cream kit s and selseb shampoo initially stocked by our customers during the fourth quarter  sales of those products during first quarter were significantly less than the fourth quarter as of december   we had  of orders held  which were subsequently shipped and recognized in the first quarter in addition  as of december   we had  of orders on backorder as a result of us being out of stock  which were subsequently shipped and recognized in the first quarter during the second quarter  a competitor launched a competing product with the same active ingredient as carmol cream 
during the fourth quarter  generic competitors introduced less expensive comparable products to carmol cream  lotion and gel  also with the same active ingredient 
these introductions of competing products resulted in a reduction in demand for our carmol cream  lotion and gel products during the three and twelve months ended december  in comparison to the same periods in the prior year 
in order to minimize a reduction in our overall net sales arising from increased competition related to the carmol products  we implemented life cycle management techniques  including launching new products keralac tm lotion and gel in the second quarter and launching keralac tm cream in the first quarter during october and february  generic competitors introduced less expensive comparable products to anamantle hc and anamantle hc cream kit  respectively 
as a result of the increased competition for anamantle hc and anamantle hc cream kit based on price  we experienced lower net sales for anamantle hc anamantle hc cream kit 
in order to minimize a reduction in net sales related to increased competition for anamantle hc  we implemented life cycle management techniques  including launching anamantle hc forte 
during january  a generic competitor introduced less expensive comparable products to keralac tm lotion and gel with the same active ingredient 
these introductions of competing products resulted in reduced demand for our keralac tm lotion and gel 
during july  generic competitors introduced less expensive comparable products to keralac tm cream  with the same active ingredient 
these introductions of these competing products resulted in reduced demand for our keralac tm cream 
in order to minimize a reduction in net sales related to increased competition for keralac tm products  we launched additional line extensions of keralac tm keralac tm nailstik in september and keralac tm ointment in october during june  a generic competitor introduced less expensive comparable products to our zoderm products 
these introductions of competing products resulted in reduced net sales for our zoderm products 
during december  a generic competitor introduced less expensive products of adoxa mg and adoxa mg tablets 
these introductions of competing products resulted in reduced net sales for those impacted adoxa products 
to minimize lost profits as a result of generic competition against adoxa  we entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with par pharmaceutical  inc under this agreement  par is obligated to pay us of its net profits from its sales of our authorized generic versions of adoxa 
to date  we have authorized par to market only mg and mg tablets of our authorized generic versions of adoxa in bottles 
in addition to entering into our agreement with par  we have implemented life cycle management techniques for adoxa  including launching adoxa paks  designed to enhance patient compliance and physician prescribing  in january and adoxa mg tablets in late in addition to increased generic competition mentioned above for carmol  anamantle hc  keralac tm  zoderm  adoxa mg and adoxa mg  we have experienced generic competition against lidamantle lotion and lidamantle hc lotion in november and rosula aqueous gel and rosula aqueous cleanser in april there is no proprietary protection for most of our products  and therefore our products face competition from generic or comparable products that are sold by other pharmaceutical companies 
increased competition from the sale of generic or comparable products may cause a decrease in sales from our products 
further  if there are decreases in sales of any other material product line  including zoderm  keralac tm  anamantle hc  pamine  adoxa or our other products  as a result of increased competition  wholesaler buying patterns  physicians prescribing habits or for any other reason and we fail to replace those sales  our revenues and profitability would decrease

further  we filed audited financial statements of the bioglan business for the period from january  through the closing  which provided more current information than  but are not a substitute for  the omitted statements of income and cash flows for the pre march  periods 
due to the significance of the acquisition of bioglan  among other factors  we were unable to obtain a waiver from the sec of the requirement to include bioglan s pre march  statements of income and cash flows in our form k filed with respect to the acquisition 
however  we believe that those omitted financial statements would not be particularly meaningful to an understanding of our current and future operations and the bioglan business because  among other reasons  we understand that the bioglan business was part of an insolvent organization prior to its acquisition by quintiles and not operated in the ordinary course of business during the period that would be covered by those financial statements 
we intend to again seek a waiver from the sec concerning our omission of those financial statements  which is a requirement for us to have future registration statements for our securities declared effective by the sec 
however  we cannot assure whether or when that waiver may be granted 
until we are able to have registration statements for public offerings of our securities declared effective by the sec  we would need to pursue additional borrowings or private placements of securities if we desire to conduct a financing  which could result in increased costs or other less favorable terms compared to public offerings 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commitments year ending december  operating leases capital leases a million senior credit facility other debt minimum inventory purchases thereafter a lease amounts include interest and minimum lease payments 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our current working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we make or anticipate significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the relevant reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates discussed below with our audit committee  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to these estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when the merchandise is shipped to an unrelated third party  as provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of the products has occurred  the selling price is both fixed and determinable  collectibility is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns and exchanges for expired products  are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time revenues are recognized  based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
we do not provide any forms of price protection to wholesale customers other than a contractual right to two wholesale customers that our price increases and product purchase discounts offered during each twelve month period will allow for inventory of our products then held by these wholesalers to appreciate in the aggregate 
we do not  however  guarantee that our wholesale customers will sell our products at a profit 
chargebacks and rebates are based on the difference between the prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the sales price ultimately paid under fixed price contracts by third party payers  who are often governmental agencies and managed care buying groups 
we record an estimate of the amount either to be charged back to us  or rebated to the end user  at the time of sale to the wholesaler 
we have recorded reserves for chargebacks and rebates based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends and our future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks and rebates claimed could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used around its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy typically allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
our return policy conforms to industry standard practices 
we believe that we have sufficient data to estimate future returns at the time of sale 
management is required to estimate the level of sales  which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net sales 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
management periodically reviews the reserves established for returns and adjusts them based on actual experience  including the execution of the dsas in but effective as of  obtaining customer inventory data for our four largest customers  a change in these customers market dynamics  having subsequent return visibility  and having increased generic competition 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales  which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
we have made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance compared to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these factors  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated the amortization of purchased goodwill 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if an event occurs that indicates the goodwill may be impaired 
we performed the test at december   and noted that no impairment existed 
as of january   we also adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our financial statements 
on august   we purchased certain assets of bioglan pharmaceuticals 
as part of the transaction  we acquired certain intellectual property  regulatory filings  and other assets relating to solaraze  a topical treatment indicated for the treatment of actinic keratosis  adoxa  an oral antibiotic indicated for the treatment of acne  zonalon  a topical treatment indicated for pruritus  tx systems  a line of advanced topical treatments used during in office procedures  and certain other dermatologic products 
the total consideration was approximately million  including acquisition costs 
with the assistance of valuation experts  we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets which we acquired as part of the transaction 
in addition  we assigned useful lives to acquired intangible assets which are not deemed to have an indefinite life 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition are being amortized over periods ranging from to years with a weighted average amortization period of years 
in light of our experience of promoting and selling dermatologic brands  we carefully evaluated the useful lives assigned to the intangible assets acquired and whether or not any impairment of any such assets was indicated 
our best estimate is that the useful lives assigned to the intangible assets remain appropriate 
our estimate of such useful lives is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
among these risks and uncertainties is our ability to develop one or more new versions of the product  obtain approval from the fda to market and sell such newly developed product 
sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets states that an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the undiscounted future cash flows of the bioglan acquisition was estimated by us over the remaining useful life of the product to exceed the carrying amount of the asset and therefore the carrying amount is estimated to be recoverable 
however  the amount recorded as intangible assets on our balance sheet for the acquired bioglan assets may be more or less than the fair value of such assets 
determining the fair value of the intangible asset is inherently uncertain  and may be dependent in significant part on the success of our revised plans to promote the bioglan brands 
deferred income taxes are provided for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax base 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and december   we determined that no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was necessary 
we believe that our projections of future taxable income makes it more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
if our projections of future taxable income changes in the future  we may be required to reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate price increases under our agreements with third party manufacturers as a result of raw material and labor price increases 
we have passed these price increases along to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that possible future inflation would not impact our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
the application of this guidance should be used to determine when an investment is considered impaired  whether an impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired is effective for evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after june  in september  the fasb issued fsp  effective date of paragraphs of eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment  which delayed certain provisions of eitf until the fasb issues further implementation guidance 
the application of this consensus did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in october  the emerging issues task force the eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf  which requires all shares that are contingently issuable under our outstanding convertible notes to be considered outstanding for its diluted earnings per share computations  if dilutive  using the if converted method of accounting from the date of issuance 
these shares were only included in the diluted earnings per share computation if our common stock price has reached certain conversion trigger prices 
eitf also requires us to retroactively restate its prior periods diluted earnings per share 
eitf is effective for periods ending after december  upon adoption  eitf had no impact on our diluted earnings per share 
in november  the fasb issued statement  inventory costs 
the standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the standard is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and eliminates the exception under abp opinion no 
for an exchange of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the standard is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sfas r will require compensation cost related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r required public companies to apply sfas r in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  in april  the sec approved a new rule that delays the effective date  requiring public companies to apply sfas r in their next fiscal year  instead of the next interim reporting period  beginning after june  as permitted by sfas  we elected to follow the guidance of apb  which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of accounting to value their share based payment transactions with employees 
sfas r allows measurement of the cost of share based payment transactions to employees at the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognition of expense over the requisite service or vesting period 
sfas r allows implementation using a modified version of prospective application  under which compensation expense of the unvested portion of previously granted awards and all new awards will be recognized on or after the date of adoption 
sfas r also allows companies to adopt sfas r by restating previously issued statements  basing the amounts on the expense previously calculated and reported in their pro forma footnote disclosures required under sfas we adopted sfas r in the first interim period of fiscal and are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas r has on our results of operations and financial position 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our purchases of entsol spray are made in euros 
we expect to make purchases several times per year 
during  our cost of sales relating to entsol spray was  we purchase finished goods and samples from a canadian company  groupe parima inc our purchases from groupe parima are made in united states dollars  but are subject to currency fluctuations if the quarterly average canadian dollar per united states dollar is outside of a previously negotiated range 
the range has a cap of canadian dollars per united states dollar and a floor of canadian dollars per united states dollar 
if the average canadian dollar per united states dollar at the end of each calendar quarter is less than  groupe parima will invoice us the difference multiplied by the sum of all invoices initiated during the calendar quarter 
if the average canadian dollar per united states dollar at the end of each calendar quarter is more than  we will invoice groupe parima the difference multiplied by the sum of all invoices initiated during the calendar quarter 
during  our expenses  in united states dollars  relating to groupe parima finished goods and samples were  during  we paid an additional  due to the average canadian dollar per united states dollar decreasing below for the applicable quarter 
if the average canadian dollar per united states dollar  based upon expenses  were less than  we would have incurred an additional  in additional expenses 
while the effect of foreign currency translations has not been material to our results of operations to date  currency translations on import purchases could be affected adversely in the future by the relationship of the united states dollar to foreign currencies 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations can have an adverse effect upon exports  even though we recognize sales to international wholesalers in united states dollars 
foreign currency fluctuations can directly affect the marketability of our products in international markets 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under our million new facility 
as of may   million was outstanding under the new facility 
the interest rates payable on these borrowings are based on libor 
if libor rates were to increase by  our annual interest expense on variable rate debt would increase by approximately  as of december   we had the following outstanding debt with fixed rate interest period debt a average fixed rate interest fiscal  fiscal n a fiscal n a fiscal n a fiscal n a fiscal n a thereafter n a a debt amounts include all interest 
our interest income is also exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments that are comprised of united states government treasury notes  which we hold on an available for sale basis
