critical accounting policies and estimates lionbridge s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires lionbridge to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
lionbridge periodically evaluates its estimates 
lionbridge bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
lionbridge reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with its audit committee and the company s board of directors 
lionbridge s current critical accounting estimates relate to the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets and the provision for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
lionbridge recognizes revenue as services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the securities and exchange staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
lionbridge considers amounts to be earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
lionbridge s revenue is recorded from the provision of services to customers for content development  product and content globalization  interpretation  software and hardware testing  product certification and application development and maintenance 
content development  software and hardware testing  interpretations and application development and maintenance projects are normally time and expense priced contracts  and revenue is recognized using a time and expense basis over the period of performance  primarily based on labor costs incurred to date 
product and content globalization and product certification projects are fixed price contracts and revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
depending on specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverable  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been met 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
the delivery of lionbridge s product and content globalization services involve  and is dependent on  the translation of content by subcontractors and in house employees 
as the time and cost to translate each word of content within a project is relatively uniform  labor input is reflective of the delivery of the contracted service and an appropriate metric for the measurement of proportional performance in delivering such services 
the use of a proportional performance assessment of service delivery requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  anticipated increases in employee wages and prices for subcontractor services  and the availability of subcontractor services 
when adjustments in estimated project costs are identified  anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
lionbridge s product and content globalization agreements with its customers may provide the customer with a fixed and limited time period following delivery during which lionbridge will attempt to address any non 
table of contents conformity to previously agreed upon objective specifications relating to the work  either in the form of a limited acceptance period or a post delivery warranty period 
management believes recognition of revenue at the time the services are delivered is appropriate  because its obligations under such provisions are limited in time  limited in scope  and historically have not involved significant costs 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance or warranty provisions become more complex or include subjective acceptance criteria  lionbridge may have to revise its revenue recognition policy appropriately  which could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
lionbridge provides integrated full service offerings throughout a client s product and content lifecycle  including globalization and testing services 
such offerings may include the delivery of a combination of one or more of our service offerings in one arrangement and are governed by the emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in these arrangements where the globalization or testing services have standalone value to the customer  and we have evidence of fair value for the services  we bifurcate the total arrangement into two units of accounting in instances where we are unable to bifurcate a project  direct and incremental costs are deferred and recognized together with the service revenue upon delivery 
the determination of fair value requires us to use significant judgment 
lionbridge determines the fair value of service revenues based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately and or prevailing market rates for similar services 
revenue includes reimbursement of travel and out of pocket expenses with equivalent amounts of expense recorded in cost of revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
lionbridge establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  lionbridge analyzes the collectibility of all accounts 
additionally  lionbridge considers its historical bad debt experience and current economic trends in evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts written off in subsequent periods can differ materially from the allowance provided 
business combinations 
in the event that lionbridge completes a business combination where the purchase method of accounting is used as required by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price paid to the assets of the business acquired  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount of excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets which typically comprise acquired customer contracts and relationships and acquired technology 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
lionbridge assesses the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that lionbridge considers important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when lionbridge determines that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon one or more of these indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment using projected discounted cash flow models 
in addition in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
during and  the company performed its annual test of goodwill to determine if there was an impairment 
these tests determined that each reporting unit s fair value exceeded the carrying value of the net assets of each respective reporting unit  using projected discounted cash flow modeling 
as a result  no impairment was required to be recorded related to the company s annual impairment testing in either year 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
lionbridge is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates as part of preparing its consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made to determine likelihood that any deferred tax asset will be utilized to offset taxable income 
to the extent that lionbridge determines that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be utilized  a valuation allowance is established 
a change in taxable income in future periods that is significantly different from that projected may cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially increase or decrease future income tax expense 
acquisitions lionbridge has grown its business since inception through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth 
such acquisitions through december  have resulted in the cumulative recognition of approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets on its balance sheet
