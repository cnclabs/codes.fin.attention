item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fremont general corporation fremont general or when combined with its subsidiaries the company is a holding company which is engaged in lending operations through its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary  fremont investment loan fil 
fil is a california state chartered industrial bank 
fremont general is not a bank holding company as defined for regulatory purposes 
fil has two primary real estate lending operations  commercial and residential  both operating on a nationwide basis 
fil s commercial real estate lending operation includes nine regional offices and  as of december   had loans outstanding in states 
the residential real estate lending platform originated loans from states through its five regional loan production centers during fil funds its operations primarily through deposit accounts sourced in california that are insured up to the maximum legal limit by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  and to a lesser extent  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb 
as such  fil is regulated by the fdic and the department of financial institutions of the state of california dfi 
fil s residential real estate lending operation originates first  and to a lesser degree  second mortgage loans on a wholesale basis through a network of independent mortgage brokers 
fil offers mortgage products that are designed for borrowers who do not generally satisfy the credit  documentation or other underwriting standards prescribed by conventional mortgage lenders  such as fannie mae and freddie mac and are commonly referred to as non prime or sub prime 
these borrowers generally have considerable equity in the properties securing their loans  but have impaired or limited credit profiles or higher debt to income ratios than conventional mortgage lenders allow 
the borrowers also include individuals who  due to self employment or other circumstances  have difficulty documenting their income through conventional means 
fil seeks to mitigate its exposure to credit risk through underwriting standards that strive to ensure appropriate loan to collateral valuations 
all of the loans that fil originates are currently either sold in whole loan sales to various financial institutions  or to a lesser extent  securitized and sold to various investors 
the company has retained some of these loans as held for investment in prior periods and may do so again in the future 
fil s commercial real estate lending operation provides first mortgage financing on various types of commercial properties 
the loans that fil originates are substantially all held for investment  with some loans participated out to reduce credit limit exposures 
loans are originated through broker and borrower relationships and the borrowers are typically mid size developers and owners seeking a loan structure that provides limited recourse and is short term  providing bridge or construction financing for comprehensive construction  renovation  conversion repositioning and lease up of existing or new properties 
to manage the credit risk involved in this lending  fil is focused on the value and quality of the collateral and the quality and experience of the parties with whom it does business 
the size of loan commitments originated generally range from million to million  with some loans for larger amounts 
the company s two operating lines of business were designed to be somewhat counter cyclical and to provide balance in varying economic cycles  however  this balance may not be achieved as both of the company s operating businesses are influenced by the overall condition of the economy  in particular the interest rate environment and  as a result  experience cyclicality in volume  gain on the sale of loans  net interest income  loan losses and earnings 
the company strives to manage its operations so as to optimize operational efficiency fremont general corporation financial statements 
table of contents and to maintain risks within acceptable parameters 
the company s lending operations generate income as follows all of the residential real estate loans originated are currently sold for varying levels of gain through whole loan sales to other financial institutions  and to a lesser degree  to various investors through securitization transactions 
a held for sale valuation reserve  a loan repurchase reserve and a premium recapture reserve are maintained and adjusted through provisions which are either an expense or a credit to income that are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
net interest income is recognized on these loans during the period that the company holds them for sale 
the company also recognizes interest income on the residual interests it retains from its securitization transactions 
servicing income is realized on the loans sold into the company s securitizations and on whole loan sales when servicing is retained  as well as on an interim basis for loans sold on a servicing released basis to other financial institutions 
when servicing is retained either through a securitization or a whole loan sale with servicing retained  a mortgage servicing rights msr asset is typically established  the msr is amortized to expense over the expected life of the related servicing income 
commercial real estate loans  which are held for investment  generate net interest income on the difference between the rates charged on the loans and the cost of borrowed funds 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions expense that are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the principal market risks the company faces are interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that the valuation of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and its net interest income will change due to changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk  which is the ability of the company to access the necessary funding and capital resources  in a cost effective manner  to fund its loan originations or to sell its loans held for sale 
the company endeavors to mitigate interest rate risk by attempting to match the rate reset or repricing characteristics of its assets with its liabilities 
the company also utilizes forward loan sale commitments to provide liquidity and to hedge its residential mortgage loan pipeline and loans held for sale  as well as interest rate caps to hedge execution of its securitization transactions 
the objective of the interest rate and liquidity risk management activities is to reduce the risk of operational disruption and to reduce the volatility in income caused by changes in interest rates  however  the mortgage banking industry is inherently subject to income volatility due to the effect of interest rate variations on loan production volume  premiums realized on loan sales and securitizations  and loan prepayment patterns  which in turn affects the valuation of the company s residual interests and msrs  as well as the amount of loan servicing income realized

changes in interest rates can affect loan interest income  gains on the sale of residential real estate loans  interest expense  loan origination volume  net investment income  and total stockholders equity

the company may experience a decrease in the amount of gain it realizes should significant interest rate volatility occur or if other economic factors have a negative impact on the value and volume of the loans the company originates 
the objective of the asset and liability management activities is to provide a high level of net interest and investment income  and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
there is no exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk resulting from differences between the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest earning loans held for investment and loans held for sale and the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest bearing liabilities used to finance these loans  such as deposits and debt 
interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree  earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in the loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations 
the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates 
for the company s financial instruments  the expected maturity date does not necessarily reflect the net market risk exposure because certain instruments are subject to interest rate changes before expected maturity 
with respect to the company s residential real estate loans held for sale and its unfunded loan pipeline  the company attempts to minimize its interest rate risk exposure through forward loan sale commitments and other derivatives  such as eurodollar futures contracts 
these financial instruments meet the definition of a derivative under generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  they are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value 
the company is reliant upon the secondary mortgage market for execution of its whole loan sales and securitizations of residential real estate loans 
while the company strives to maintain adequate levels of liquidity support and capital to withstand certain disruptions in the secondary mortgage market  a significant disruption could adversely impact the company s ability to fund  sell  securitize or finance its residential real estate loan origination volume  leading to reduced gains on sale and a corresponding decrease in revenue and earnings 
a deterioration in performance of the residential real estate loans after being sold in whole loan sales and securitizations could adversely impact the availability and pricing of such future transactions

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the company continued to securitize its residential real estate loans 
securitization is a process of transforming the loans into securities  which are sold to investors 
the loans are first sold to a special purpose corporation  which then transfers them to a qualifying special purpose entity a qspe which is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly known as asset backed securities  that are secured by the future cash flows to be derived from the sold loans 
the qspe uses the proceeds from the issuance of the securities to pay the purchase price of the securitized loans 
the company does not utilize unconsolidated special purpose entities as a mechanism to remove non performing assets from the consolidated balance sheets 
securitization is used by the company to provide an additional source of liquidity 
the qspes are not consolidated into the company s financial statements since they meet the criteria established by sfas no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas no 

in general  those criteria require the qspe to be isolated and distinct from the transferor the company  be limited to permitted activities  and have defined limits on the assets it can hold and the permitted sales  exchanges or distributions of its assets 
during  the company securitized billion in residential real estate loans 
the investors and the qspes do not have any recourse to the company if the cash flows generated by the sold loans are inadequate to service the securities issued by the qspes 
at the close of each securitization  the company removes from its balance sheet the carrying value of the loans sold and adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair value of the assets obtained in consideration for the loans which generally include the cash received net of transaction expenses  retained junior class securities referred to as residual interests and mortgage servicing rights 
additional information concerning the company s securitization activities is included in notes    and of notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
gain on whole loan sales and securitizations the company recognizes net gains or losses on whole loan sales and securitizations of its residential real estate loans at the date of settlement and when the company has transferred control over the loans to either a third party purchaser or to a securitization transaction 
the amount of gain or loss for whole loan sales is based upon the difference between the net cash received for the loans and the allocated carrying value of the loans 
the company primarily sells its whole loans on a servicing released basis and the net cash received includes a premium for the mortgage servicing rights 
in a securitization transaction  the company typically retains the mortgage servicing rights and a gain is recognized to the extent that the net selling price based upon the allocated fair values of the assets obtained at the date of transfer exceeds the carrying value of the loans sold 
the company structures each securitization transaction to meet the sale requirements of sfas no 
and  as a result  at the closing of each securitization  the company removes from its balance sheet the carrying value of the loans held for sale and adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair value of the assets obtained from the sale of loans through the securitization transaction which generally include the cash received net of transaction expenses  retained junior class interests residual interests in securitized loans  and mortgage servicing rights 
the carrying value of the loans sold generally is loan principal balance plus the direct costs of origination  less the net amount of fees received from the borrower 
concurrent with a securitization transaction  the company monetizes its retained residual interests through the issuance of net interest margin securities or nims 
the retained residual interests represent certain excess cash flows and prepayment fees from the securitization transaction  these cash flows serve as the collateralization for issuing the nims 
the retained residual interests are sold to a qspe a nim trust or llc from which interest bearing notes are issued 
the cash flow from the retained residual interests pays down the nim notes until they are paid in full  the company retains an interest which entitles it to receive the cash flow coming to the nim trust or llc after the nim notes have been extinguished 
the combination of the securitization transaction and the nim transaction enabled the company to generate upfront cash flow in excess of its carrying value of the loans sold 
the company values the retained interest in a nim transaction at fair value utilizing various assumptions that are inherently subject to volatility  such as anticipated prepayments of the loans  estimated credit losses and interest rate projections  and thus the value of the retained interest may exhibit variation as economic conditions fluctuate 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to adequately provide for known and probable losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is fremont general corporation financial statements 
table of contents established through a provision for loan losses in the consolidated statements of income and reduced by charge offs of loan balances related to specific loans 
the company utilizes a systematic methodology for determining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
management s methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance encompasses a variety of risk assumptions  both quantitative and qualitative  and the process includes a periodic loan by loan review of loans that are individually evaluated for impairment as well as detailed reviews of other loans  either individually or in pools 
quantitative factors include historical loss experience by property type and geographic market  delinquency trends  collateral values  specific problem loans  trends in problem and potential problem loans  and other relevant factors 
qualitative factors include prevailing and anticipated economic trends regionally  nationally and by industry  trends in volume  size and terms of loans  changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  loan concentrations geographic  property type and industry  and other relevant factors 
while this methodology utilizes historical and other objective information deemed to warrant recognition in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  the adequacy of the allowance is subject to variation as conditions change 
derivatives the company utilizes various derivative financial instruments in connection with its interest rate risk management activities and  as of december   utilized a combination of forward sales commitments and eurodollar futures contracts to hedge its residential loans held for sale and a certain portion of its unfunded pipeline 
the company s forward sales commitments represent obligations to sell loans at a specific price and date in the future 
the value of these commitments increases as interest rates increase 
short eurodollar futures contracts are standardized exchange traded contracts  the values of which are tied to spot eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the values of these futures contracts increase when interest rates increase 
these derivatives are intended to reduce the risk of adverse fair value changes in certain interest rate environments 
as established by sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 derivative financial instruments are reported at their fair value 
the company distinguishes commitments to sell forward loans in two categories  allocated and unallocated 
allocated forward sales commitments are contractual sales agreements whereby a specific pool of loans is agreed upon to be sold to specific buyers at a contractually agreed upon date and price 
both the allocated and unallocated sales commitments are currently treated as economic hedges not designated as accounting hedges and are classified as free standing derivatives 
the company s eurodollar futures contracts are currently treated as economic hedges not designated as accounting hedges and are classified as free standing derivatives 
in addition  the company conditionally quotes interest rates to potential borrowers  which are then subject to adjustment by the company if any such conditions are not satisfied 
since the company generally funds the loans at the rate lock commitments  which generally are for days  they are treated as free standing derivatives and are carried at their estimated fair value 
interest rate lock commitments are valued at zero at inception 
income taxes the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the ability to recover previously paid taxes through loss carrybacks and the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
the gain inherent in the company s loans held for sale has been recognized into taxable income in periods prior to being recognized into gaap income 
therefore  when the loans held for sale are ultimately sold  there will be no tax paid on the gain per gaap since the taxable gain was recognized in a previous period 
deferred tax assets relating to the allowance for loan losses are dependent on future taxable income to offset the deductions which are expected to arise when the loans relating to the allowance are ultimately charged off 
management s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market fremont general corporation financial statements 
table of contents conditions  loan loss experience  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances
