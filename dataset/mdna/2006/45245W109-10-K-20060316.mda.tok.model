com  for important safety information relating to erbitux  including boxed warnings 
erbitux binds specifically to the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  her  c erbb on both normal and tumor cells  and competitively inhibits the binding of the epidermal growth factor egf and other ligands  such as transforming growth factor alpha 
the egfr is constitutively expressed in many normal epithelial tissues  including the skin and hair follicle 
expression of egfr is also detected in many human cancers including those of the head and neck  colon and rectum 
we are conducting  and in some cases have completed  clinical studies evaluating erbitux for broader use in colorectal and head and neck cancers  lung and pancreatic cancers  as well as other potential indications 
in september  health canada approved erbitux for use in combination with irinotecan for the treatment of egfr expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma in patients who are refractory to other irinotecan based chemotherapy regimens and for use as a single agent for the treatment of egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal carcinoma in patients who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
on december   swissmedic  the swiss agency for therapeutic products  approved erbitux in switzerland for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer who no longer respond to standard chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan 
merck kgaa licensed the right to market erbitux outside the united states and canada from the company in in japan  merck kgaa has marketing rights to erbitux  which are co exclusive to the co development rights of the company and bms 
on june   merck kgaa received marketing approval by the european commission to sell erbitux for use in combination with irinotecan for the treatment of patients with egfr expressing metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of irinotecan including cytotoxic therapy 
on december   swissmedic approved erbitux in switzerland in combination with radiation in the treatment of patients with previously untreated  advanced scchn 
we co promote and otherwise support the commercial launch and sale in new indications of erbitux in north america together with our development  promotion and distribution partner brystol myers squibb company bms through its wholly owned subsidiary er squibb sons  er er squibb 
we manufacture erbitux for clinical studies and for commercial sales 
according to our agreements with bms and merck kgaa  each is obligated to pay us certain royalties on their sales of erbitux 
in addition to achieving approval in the above indications  we also have undertaken a comprehensive clinical development program to evaluate the broader use of erbitux in colorectal cancer  including two phase iii randomized studies known as bms second line metastatic setting and bms refractory metastatic setting 
we have completed enrollment in both of these randomized studies 
in collaboration with the national cancer institute nci cooperative groups  studies in first line colorectal cancer calgb and first line pancreatic cancer swog enrolled patients in subsequently calgb was closed to enrollment after accruing patients and a new first line colorectal cancer protocol that incorporates both erbitux and avastin developed by calgb began enrolling patients in by all of the nci cooperative groups intergroup 
furthermore  the nci cooperative groups began a phase iii randomized study to evaluate the merits of adding erbitux in the adjuvant setting trials following definitive surgical treatment of stage c locoregional colorectal cancer 
numerous registration directed studies of erbitux are underway in various other locoregional and advanced disease settings colorectal cancer  non small cell lung cancer  head and neck cancer and pancreatic cancer and pilot studies are either underway or planned to further evaluate the development of erbitux for other indications and tumor types 
additionally  enrollment started in in a phase i study of imc f  a fully human egfr antibody  in patients with solid tumors who have failed standard therapy 
in addition to our work developing and commercializing erbitux  we are developing investigational inhibitors of angiogenesis  which could be used to treat various kinds of cancer and other diseases 
we have identified potential monoclonal antibody based inhibitors  collectively known to us as imc kdr antibodies 
investigational data available to date indicate that the imc kdr antibodies bind selectively and with high affinity to the kinase insert domain containing receptor kdr  a principal vascular endothelial growth factor vegf receptor  thereby  we believe  inhibiting angiogenesis 
a phase i study of imc b  a fully human anti vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr antibody  in patients with advanced solid tumors was initiated in in august  imclone entered into a co development relationship with ucb to develop cdp  a humanized di fab antibody to vegfr conjugated to polyethylene glycol peg 
ucb s randomized phase ii study of non small cell lung cancer  evaluating treatment with chemotherapy with or without cdp  began in the company is no longer working in the area of cancer vaccines 
no further clinical studies of bec  a monoclonal antibody we were developing as a cancer vaccine  will be sponsored by imclone subsequent to the failure of the silva study to meet its endpoints in small cell lung cancer 
following the analysis of this phase iii data in small cell lung cancer  we and merck kgaa agreed to discontinue further development of bec in december  we agreed with merck kgaa to also cease work on the recombinant gp antigen  with respect to which we were collaborating with merck kgaa  as well as our gp dna vaccine  which is the subject of an ongoing phase i study as a treatment for melanoma 
we have therefore terminated our agreement with merck for both bec and gp antigen 
in addition to the development and commercialization of erbitux and the development of our lead product candidates  we continue to conduct research  both independently and in collaboration with academic and corporate partners  in a number of areas related to our core focus of tumor cell growth factor inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors 
we also have developed diagnostic products and vaccines for certain infectious diseases  and we have licensed the rights to these products and vaccines to corporate partners 
however  we are no longer actively developing product candidates in the areas of diagnostic and infectious diseases 
on january   we announced that our board of directors had engaged the investment bank lazard to conduct  in conjunction with management  a full review of the company s strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value 
these alternatives could include a merger  sale or strategic alliance 
the company is proceeding in consultation with its existing partners as the process moves forward 
clinical development programs erbitux cancer therapeutic erbitux is an igg chimerized part human  part mouse monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the egfr and thereby inhibits growth of tumors dependent upon activation of the egfr for cell division and survival 
the activation of the egfr is believed to play a critical role in the growth and survival of certain types of tumor cells and select normal cells 
certain cancer types are characterized by the expression of the egfr 
for example  imcl and other studies conducted by us have indicated that approximately of advanced stage refractory colorectal cancer cases have been shown to express the egfr in tumor cells 
similarly  according to the literature in this area  nearly all patients diagnosed with scchn have been shown to express the egfr on the surface of the tumor cells  therefore  no egfr testing is required to use erbutux based on the approved scchn indication 
according to the american cancer society  an estimated  cases of colorectal cancer and an estimated  cases of head and neck cancer will be diagnosed in the united states in other types of cancer are also characterized  in certain patients  by expression of the egfr  including non small cell lung  renal  and pancreatic cancers 
by preventing the binding of critical growth factors to the egfr  we believe it is possible to inhibit the growth and survival of these tumors 
erbitux clinical studies the charts presented below reflect studies in selected tumor types that we and our partners  merck kgaa and bms  are developing or collaborating on with the national cancer institute and various european cooperative groups  and are designed both for registration purposes and exploratory development in these indications

avastin erbitux adjuvant as part of our confirmatory obligation to the fda in regard to the approval of erbitux for colorectal cancer  we initiated a phase ii study enrolling patients with refractory  egfr non detectable  metastatic colorectal cancer 
this study is designed to estimate the overall response rate and duration obtained with single agent erbitux use and is targeted to complete accrual in in conjunction with our us partner  bms  and our partner in the rest of the world  merck kgaa  we have opened or expect to open additional studies in colorectal cancer  including randomized studies in first line  second line  and refractory settings for metastatic colorectal cancer  as well as in the adjuvant setting involving patients with locoregionally advanced disease following definitive surgical resection 
upon the approval of erbitux for colorectal cancer under the accelerated approval mechanism  studies bms and bms were designated as studies in the second line metastatic setting to confirm the clinical benefit of erbitux 
bms  which opened for patient enrollment in may  tests the addition of erbitux to irinotecan in patients who have failed oxaliplatin  fluorouracil  and leucovorin in the first line of therapy 
bms  which is being conducted in collaboration with merck kgaa  finished patient accrual in february preliminary toxicity data  substantiating the safety of the regimen  was presented at the annual american society of clinical oncology asco meeting in another study  bms  which opened for patient enrollment and treatment in march and which is now currently closed to accrual  tests the addition of erbitux and the combination of oxaliplatin  fluorouracil  and leucovorin folfox in patients who have failed irinotecan  fluorouracil  and leucovorin 
a pooled analysis of the preliminary results of this study was presented at the annual asco meeting in in the pooled analysis  the incidence of the characteristic erbitux and folfox toxicities does not seem to be increased as compared to the reported incidences in the erbitux and eloxatin package inserts 
based on our limited investigational experience the combination of folfox and erbitux appears to be a feasible regimen 
emr crystal  a randomized phase iii study that evaluates the merits of adding erbitux to irinotecan and infusional fluorouracil folfiri as first line therapy in patients with metastatic disease  completed patient accrual in december many other randomized phase iii trials sponsored by either merck kgaa  imclone  and or bms and or various national cooperative oncology groups in us and europe are evaluating the merits of adding erbitux to many different chemotherapy regimens plus or minus avastin in the first and second line metastatic setting

rtog  which opened to patient enrollment in november  was designed to extend the positive results with erbitux reported from study imcl in this phase iii study  patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer are being randomized to treatment with either radiation plus chemotherapy or radiation plus chemotherapy plus erbitux 
the eastern cooperative oncology group ecog published the final results of ecog  a randomized phase iii study of cisplatin plus erbitux versus cisplatin in the journal of clinical oncology 
in this study  the objective response rate was significantly higher for the erbitux arm versus 
both overall survival and progression free survival were numerically higher in patients receiving erbitux plus cisplatin  but the study was not adequate to demonstrate clinically relevant differences in these endpoints 
based on the results of ecog  as well as nonrandomized studies demonstrating the activity of erbitux in patients with recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancer following treatment with platinum based regimens  merck kgaa developed emr  a randomized phase iii study of cisplatin plus fluorouracil versus cisplatin plus fluorouracil plus erbitux 
the study  which was nearly completely accrued in january  may support registering erbitux in this indication in both the us and worldwide 
imclone and its partners  bms and merck kgaa  have also begun a large number of phase i and ii studies  some of which are randomized  to evaluate the merits of adding erbitux to a wide variety of radiation and chemoradiation regimens in many different settings of head and neck cancer eg neoadjuvant  adjuvant  metastatic  locoregional

months  merck kgaa began a phase iii randomized clinical trial flex  which finished target patient accrual in the first quarter of although this trial may be used to support the registration of erbitux  bms and bms were initiated to provide further support for erbitux in the first line treatment setting of patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer 
in  the size of bms was increased from to patients and the principal endpoint was modified from response rate to progression free survival  whereas the size of bms was decreased from to  which met its accrual target in at asco  the radiation therapy oncology group rtog presented preliminary toxicity and feasibility data on rtog which evaluated the feasibility  safety and efficacy of erbitux combined with taxol carboplatin and radiation  in patients with locoregionally advanced stage iiia nonsmall lung cancer 
the rtog reported that the regimen was both safe and feasible  efficacy results are pending 
in addition  the southwest oncology group swog completed accrual to swog  a randomized phase ii study evaluating combined therapy with erbitux paclitaxel carboplatin combined versus paclitaxel carboplatin followed by erbitux sequential in patients with stages iiib or iv nonsmall cell lung cancer 
both swog and rtog are planning randomized phase iii studies in advanced and locoregionally advanced patients  respectively  depending on the results of these aforementioned phase iii studies  which are expected to be available in mid furthermore  imcl select  which began in  is actively accruing patients to evaluate the merits of adding erbitux to chemotherapy in the second line metastatic setting  and a wide range of both randomized and nonrandomized phase i and phase ii studies  sponsored by imclone  bms  and merck kgaa  are evaluating erbitux in combination with many chemotherapy and chemoradiation regimens in neoadjuvant  adjuvant  locoregionally advanced  and advanced non small cell lung cancer disease settings

accrual has been quite rapid and the accrual is projected to be complete in the first quarter of  with top line data available sometime during the second half of or the first quarter of a number of phase ii randomized studies sponsored by imclone and bms or the nci cooperative oncology groups have been or will be initiated in these studies are designed to evaluate the merits of adding erbitux to various chemotherapy regimens consisting of either gemcitabine or irinotecan plus docetaxel  and several of these studies will evaluate erbitux combined with chemotherapy as well as the vegf inhibitor avastin 
further  we  in collaboration with our partners bms and merck kgaa  as well as the nci cooperative oncology groups are evaluating the feasibility and activity of administering erbitux with several other gemcitabine based chemotherapy regimens in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer  as well as evaluating the feasibility of administering erbitux with chemotherapy and or radiotherapy in earlier stages of the diseases  particularly in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings 
other cancers in collaboration with our partners bms and merck kgaa  we are in the process of supporting a wide array and large number of phase i and ii evaluations of erbitux administered alone or combined with other therapeutic modalities in adult malignancies that express egfr  including carcinomas of the brain  esophagus  stomach  rectum  cervix  endometrium  ovary  bladder  prostate  and breast  as well as pediatric malignancies 
in  imclone will sponsor a series of multicenter randomized phase ii studies to evaluate the merits of adding erbitux to standard therapy used to treat patients with bladder  prostate  esophageal  and ovarian cancers 
we and bms also presented preliminary results from study bms  in which tumor biopsies were performed on approximately patients with refractory colorectal cancer prior to treatment with erbitux to ascertain biomarker and or pharmacogenomic predictors of drug activity 
a wide variety of genomic markers  signaling proteins  and relevant ligands are being assessed by our scientists and our collaborators  bms and genomic health  inc safety and other general information grade infusion reactions  rarely with fatal outcome in  occurred in approximately of patients receiving erbitux cetuximab therapy  characterized by rapid onset of airway obstruction bronchospasm  stridor  hoarseness  urticaria  hypotension  and or cardiac arrest 
severe infusion reactions require immediate and permanent discontinuation of erbitux therapy 
most reactions were associated with the first infusion of erbitux despite the use of prophylactic antihistamines 
caution must be exercised with every erbitux infusion as there were patients who experienced their first severe infusion reaction during later infusions 
a hour observation period is recommended following the erbitux infusion 
longer observation periods may be required in patients who experience infusion reactions 
cardiopulmonary arrest and or sudden death occurred in of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with radiation therapy and erbitux as compared to none of patients treated with radiotherapy alone 
erbitux in combination with radiation therapy should be used with caution in patients with known coronary artery disease  congestive heart failure and arrhythmias 
close monitoring of serum electrolytes  including serum magnesium  potassium  and calcium during and after cetuximab therapy is recommended 
severe cases of interstitial lung disease ild  which was fatal in one case  occurred in less than of patients with advanced colorectal cancer mcrc receiving erbitux 
there was one case n of ild reported in patients in head and neck clinical trials with erbitux 
in clinical studies of erbitux  dermatologic toxicities  including acneform rash  skin drying and fissuring  and inflammatory and infectious sequelae eg  blepharitis  cheilitis  cellulitis  cyst were reported 
severe grade acneform rash was reported in of patients with head and neck cancer treated with erbitux plus radiation and in of patients treated with erbitux as a single agent as well as of patients with mcrc treated with erbitux 
sun exposure may exacerbate these effects 
a related nail disorder  occurring in grade of patients  was characterized as a paronychial inflammation 
the incidence of hypomagnesemia both overall and severe 
nci ctc grades was increased in patients receiving erbitux alone or in combination with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving best supportive care or chemotherapy alone based on ongoing  controlled clinical trials in patients 
approximately one half of these patients receiving erbitux experienced hypomagnesemia and experienced severe hypomagnesemia 
electrolyte repletion was necessary in some patients and in severe cases  intravenous replacement was required 
the safety of erbitux in combination with radiation therapy and cisplatin has not been established 
death and serious cardiotoxicity were observed in a single arm trial with erbitux  delayed  accelerated concomitant boost fractionation radiation therapy  and cisplatin mg m conducted in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
two of patients died  one as a result of pneumonia and one of an unknown cause 
four patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events 
two of these discontinuations were due to cardiac events myocardial infarction in one patient and arrhythmia  diminished cardiac output  and hypotension in the other patient 
additional serious adverse events associated with erbitux in combination with rt in patients with head and neck cancer were mucositis  radiation dermatitis  confusion and diarrhea 
additional serious adverse events associated with erbitux in mcrc clinical trials n were fever  sepsis  kidney failure  pulmonary embolus  dehydration in patients receiving erbitux with irinotecan  in patients receiving erbitux as a single agent  and diarrhea in patients receiving erbitux with irinotecan  in patients receiving erbitux as a single agent 
the overall incidence of late radiation toxicities any grade was higher in erbitux in combination with radiation therapy compared with radiation therapy alone 
the following sites were affected salivary glands  larynx  subcutaneous tissue  mucous membranes  esophagus  skin  brain  lung  spinal cord  and bone in the erbitux and radiation versus radiation alone arms  respectively 
the incidence of grade or late radiation toxicities were generally similar between the radiation therapy alone and the erbitux plus radiation therapy 
the most common adverse events seen in patients with carcinomas of the head and neck receiving erbitux in combination with radiation therapy n versus radiation alone n were mucositis stomatitis  acneform rash  radiation dermatitis  weight loss  xerostomia  dysphagia  asthenia  nausea  constipation and vomiting

com for important safety information relating to erbitux  including boxed warnings 
human monoclonal egfr inhibitor we have developed a fully human monoclonal antibody  referred to as imc f  which targets the human egfr 
imc f is a high affinity antibody that blocks ligand dependent activation of the egfr 
pre clinical in vitro studies have shown that imc f inhibits egfr activation  downstream signaling pathways and growth of human tumor cells 
in pre clinical human tumor xenograft models  imc f suppresses the growth of egfr positive tumors and enhances the activity of chemotherapeutic drugs when used in combination 
we intend to commercialize this antibody in europe and potentially elsewhere and we believe that we have rights to do so under our agreements with bms and merck kgaa 
however  merck kgaa has advised us that it believes that imc f is covered under our existing developmental and license agreement with merck kgaa and that it could therefore have the exclusive rights to market imc f outside the united states and canada and co exclusive development rights in japan  for which it would pay the same royalty as it pays for erbitux 
see corporate collaborations collaborations with merck kgaa and legal proceedings 
we believe that imc f is not covered under the merck kgaa development and license agreement 
this dispute has been submitted to binding arbitration through an expedited process outside of the provisions of the development and license agreement  the results of which we expect in the near future 
if successful in the arbitration  merck kgaa averred that it is entitled to certain unspecified damages under the development and license agreement 
while we intend to vigorously defend our position as it relates to imc f in arbitration  there is no assurance that our position would prevail and we are unable to predict the outcome of these procedings 
commercial rights to this antibody in the us and canada fall within the scope of our agreement with bms regarding erbitux 
the company received approval to begin phase i clinical trials of imc f from the national institute for public health and the environment rivm  the dutch regulatory agency 
the first patient began treatment in fourth quarter of in a phase i clinical trial of patients with solid tumors 
the two center study is being conducted at the free university in amsterdam and utrecht university in utrecht  and is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacology of imc f administered weekly or bi weekly by intravenous infusion 
the preliminary results of this trial  which is projected to achieve its objectives and close to patient accrual in the second half of  will be reported at the asco meeting 
disease directed developmental trials of f are projected to begin in the second half of study description population target enrollment cp phase i study of weekly and bi weekly human anti epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody f in patients with advanced solid tumors monoclonal antibody inhibitors of angiogenesis our general experience with growth factors  particularly the use of erbitux to block the egfr  is mirrored in our pursuit of what may be another promising approach for the treatment of cancer  the inhibition of angiogenesis 
angiogenesis is the natural process of new blood vessel growth 
vegf is one of a group of molecules that helps regulate angiogenesis 
tumor cells  as well as normal cells  produce vegf 
once produced by the tumor cells  vegf stimulates the production of new blood vessels and ensures an adequate blood supply to the tumor  enabling the tumor to grow 
kdr is a growth factor receptor found almost exclusively on the surface of human endothelial cells  which are the cells that line all blood vessels 
vegf must recognize and bind to this kdr receptor in order to stimulate the endothelial cells to grow and cause new blood vessels to form 
we believe that interference with the binding of vegf to the kdr receptor inhibits angiogenesis and potentially can be used to slow or halt tumor growth 
we have identified potential inhibitors collectively known by us as imc kdr antibodies 
in  we concluded a phase i clinical study with a chimeric part human  part mouse anti kdr antibody known as imc c in  we identified several fully human monoclonal anti kdr antibodies with potent anti kdr activity 
in  we initiated pre clinical development of one of these antibodies  imc b 
we filed an investigational new drug application ind for imc b in july and initiated clinical studies assessing its potential for angiogenesis inhibition in cancer patients during the fourth quarter of this fully human antibody replaced imc c in our development pipeline 
subject to further investigation  we believe that such inhibitors could be effective in treating many solid and liquid tumors and may also be useful in treating other diseases  such as diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration that  like cancer  depend on the growth of new blood vessels 
study description population target enrollment cp phase i study of weekly anti vascular endothelial growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors in  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with ucb s 
a to develop cdp  consisting of di fab human monoclonal antibody segments linked together by a peg linker 
in a phase i study in patients with advanced solid malignancies  cdp did not demonstrate dose limiting toxicities up to doses of mg kg every weeks  a dose level projected to achieve biologically relevant concentrations for most of the dosing interval 
in august  ucb started a randomized phase i ii study of cdp plus carboplatin paclitaxel in previously untreated patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer 
in this study  patients are being randomized to treatment with either carboplatin paclitaxel alone or with cdp at or mg kg every weeks 
in  we and ucb plan to start disease directed clinical evaluations of cdp study description population target enrollment rpcea phase i ii randomized study of paclitaxel carboplatin administered either alone or combined with cdp at or mg kg in patients with advanced stage iiib or iv non small cell lung cancer monoclonal antibody to insulin like growth factor receptor in  we successfully filed an ind for imc a  a unique human monoclonal antibody against insulin like growth factor receptor igfr which is expressed in diverse human tumor types 
activation of igfr in cancer cells in preclinical models increases the cells ability to survive  especially under conditions of chemotherapy or radiotherapy  and it also contributes to cancer cell growth  as well as the development of resistance to chemotherapeutics  hormones estrogens and androgens  and signal transduction inhibitors 
imc a prevents binding of insulin like growth factor to the receptor  thus preventing its activation and triggering of survival and growth mechanisms in cancer cells 
the antibody also causes rapid internalization removal from the cell surface of igfr  thus further interfering with cancer growth supporting properties of the receptor 
following successful filing of an ind for imc a in  we began a phase i study of the agent in patients with solid malignancies in december study description population target enrollment cp phase i study of imc a  an anti igfr human monoclonal antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr like vegfr  the target of our anti kdr antibodies  the vegfr receptor also known as flt is believed to be involved in blood vessel formation  but recent data suggest that it may function in novel ways unrelated to angiogenesis 
we have discovered that vegfr is expressed by a number of human tumors  most notably breast and colorectal cancer 
we have developed specific antibodies that block the function of vegfr and have conducted pre clinical studies showing that these antibodies can inhibit the growth of human breast and colorectal tumors in pre clinical models 
it is believed that vegfr inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of vegfr positive tumors  such as breast or colorectal cancer and we are developing therapeutic antibodies against this target for future clinical studies 
we successfully filed an ind for imc f  a fully human monoclonal antibody to vegfr  in december  for which we are beginning a phase i study in the first half of monoclonal antibody against platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha pdgfra pdgfra is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the binding of platelet derived growth factors 
studies have shown that pdgfra is expressed on ovarian  prostate  breast  lung  glial  skin and bone tumors 
we have developed a fully human antibody  designated imc g  that effectively blocks the function of pdgfra and inhibits the growth of glioblastoma and leiomyosarcoma tumors in animal models 
we are conducting additional pre clinical studies to evaluate if our antibody can also inhibit the growth of other cancers 
we expect to file an ind for imc g in the first half of and begin a phase i trial in the second half of research programs general our research programs have been focused on clear goals the identification of antibodies with growth inhibiting activity against human tumors 
to this end we have discontinued our small molecule and vaccine programs 
after an extensive analysis we determined that our strengths and expertise lie in the identification of new tumor targets and the selection and production of antibodies that bind and inhibit the activity of these targets 
in addition to concentrating on our products in development  we perform ongoing research  including research in each of the areas of our ongoing clinical programs of growth factor blockers  other tumor cell growth inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors 
we have assembled a scientific staff with expertise in a variety of disciplines  including oncology  immunology  molecular and cellular biology  antibody engineering  bioinformatics and protein chemistry 
we have centralized our target identification group into a new tumor biology department 
these scientists have the primary responsibility of identifying new targets and validating their role in tumor growth and development 
new targets are both engendered internally and obtained from external partners 
also  we recently concluded an agreement with caprion pharmaceuticals and are currently validating a series of new targets 
additional collaborations of this type are under consideration 
our primary goal is to identify a number of targets sufficient to support and expand our portfolio beyond our current level 
in addition to pursuing research programs in house  we collaborate with academic institutions and corporations to support our research and development efforts 
research on growth factor blockers research on modulators of apoptosis programmed cell death we are developing antibody therapeutics that interfere with anti apoptotic signaling and survival mechanisms of cancer cells 
one mechanism involves the insulin like growth factor receptor igfr which is frequently over expressed in diverse human tumor types 
activation of igfr in cancer cells increases the cells ability to survive  especially under conditions of chemotherapy or radiotherapy  and it also contributes to cancer cell growth 
we have developed and evaluated an antibody to igfr  designated imc a  that blocks binding of insulin like growth factor to the receptor  thus preventing its activation and triggering of survival and growth mechanisms in cancer cells 
the antibody also causes rapid internalization removal from the cell surface of igfr  thus further interfering with cancer growth supporting properties of the receptor 
the imc a ind was accepted by the fda and our phase i study was initiated and is ongoing 
research on vegfr inhibitors we are investigating the activities of antibodies that block the function of vegfr flt  another receptor to which vegf binds 
like vegfr  the target of our anti kdr antibodies  the vegfr receptor is believed to be involved in blood vessel formation  but recent data suggest that it may function in novel ways unrelated to angiogenesis 
we have discovered that vegfr is expressed by a number of human tumors  most notably breast and colorectal cancer 
we have developed specific antibodies that block the function of vegfr and have conducted pre clinical studies showing that these antibodies can inhibit the growth of human breast and colorectal tumors in pre clinical models 
it is believed that vegfr inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of vegfr positive tumors  such as breast or colorectal cancer and we are developing therapeutic antibodies against this target for future clinical studies 
one such agent  imc f  is a fully human monoclonal antibody for which an ind has been filed and accepted 
phase i studies should begin in the first half of research on pdgfr alpha inhibitors platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha pdgfra is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the binding of platelet derived growth factors 
studies have shown that pdgfra is expressed on ovarian  prostate  breast  lung  glial  skin and bone tumors 
we have developed a fully human antibody  designated imc g  that effectively blocks the function of pdgfra and inhibits the growth of glioblastoma and leiomyosarcoma tumors in animal models 
we are conducting additional pre clinical studies to evaluate if our antibody can also inhibit the growth of other cancers 
we expect to file an ind for imc g early in anti fgfr dysregulation of the fibroblast growth factor fgf and receptor fgfr pathway has been linked to the development of both solid tumors and hematological malignancies 
inhibiting this pathway may therefore have therapeutic benefit 
two neutralizing antibodies were generated that target fgfr and fgfr  respectively 
these antibodies have been tested for anti tumor effects in vitro and have shown activity in prostate and bladder carcinoma  multiple myeloma and leukemia 
significant tumor inhibition in vivo was observed in human prostate xenografts treated with anti fgfr  and in human multiple myeloma xenografts treated with anti fgfr anti ron the macrophage stimulating protein receptor ron belongs to the c met family of receptor tyrosine kinases 
since its discovery in  several lines of evidence suggest that ron is expressed in several major cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis 
antagonists of ron activity  however  have not been reported 
consequently  we generated several fully human monoclonal antibodies that bind to human ron with high affinity and block ligand binding 
by preventing ron signaling  these antibodies have significantly inhibited cancer cell line invasion migration as well as tumor formation in several tumor xenograft models 
these findings are the first to validate ron as a cancer target and underscore the potential of ron antibodies for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of human cancer 
current efforts are focused on antibody production in preparation for clinical development 
anti gp gp is a melanoma antigen and an ideal target for antibody based therapy 
a novel fully human antibody to gp  d  was generated 
this antibody is effective against a panel of human melanomas grown as xenografts in nude mice 
we are currently exploring additional pre clinical models 
anti flt flt is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in the majority of acute myelogenous leukemias and lymphocytic leukeumia 
we have developed a fully human anti flt antagonist antibody named imc eb preclinical studies have shown that imc eb significantly inhibits leukemia cell growth in human leukemia xenograft models in mice 
in another approach  we have recently developed an immunotoxin conjugate named eb mmaf using imc eb antibody in collaboration with seattle genetics 
preclinical data have demonstrated that eb mmaf has a potent  antigen specific therapeutic activity in xenograft models 
research on angiogenesis inhibitors research on vegfr inhibitors we are continuing to work with an experimental antibody known as dc in animal models in order to support the clinical development of our imc kdr monoclonal antibody known as imc b 
dc neutralizes the flk receptor  which is the mouse receptor to vegf that corresponds to kdr in humans 
tumor models in mice have shown that dc inhibits tumor growth as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy 
we filed an ind for imc b in august and have since started a clinical phase i trial to study its potential for angiogenesis inhibition in cancer patients 
research on ve cadherin inhibitors in another approach to angiogenesis inhibition  we are exploring the therapeutic potential of antibodies against vascular specific cadherin ve cadherin 
cadherins are a family of cell surface molecules that help organize tissue structures 
ve cadherin is believed to play an important role in angiogenesis by organizing endothelial cells into vascular tubes  which is a necessary step in the formation of new blood vessels 
advanced tumor growth is dependent on the formation of a capillary blood vessel network in the tumor to ensure an adequate blood supply to the tumor 
therefore  antibodies that inhibit ve cadherin may inhibit such capillary formation in tumors  and help fight cancer by cutting off adequate blood supply to the tumor 
pre clinical studies using monoclonal antibodies against ve cadherin have demonstrated that inhibition of angiogenesis  tumor growth and metastasis occurs as a consequence of interfering with the ability of ve cadherin to form tubular structures 
we are evaluating in pre clinical studies antibodies that are efficacious in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth without negatively affecting existing vessels 
in connection with our ve cadherin research program  we have an exclusive license from icos corporation to certain patent rights pertaining to ve cadherin and antibodies thereto for the treatment of cancer in humans 
research on vegfr inhibitors antagonist antibodies to vegfr also known as flt have several potential therapeutic uses blocking of metastasis by inhibiting lymphangiogenesis  blocking tumor angiogenesis  inhibiting the growth of tumors stimulated by flt vegf c or d autocrine loops and inhibiting inflammation 
systemic treatment of mice with monoclonal antibody  mf c  directed to the mouse vegfr results in inhibition of new lymphatic formation in tumor models  leading to significant inhibition of metastasis 
administration of mf c reduces the growth of primary human tumors in mice most likely by blocking angiogenesis or tumor inflammation and this effect appears to act additively with chemotherapy 
in a model of lung inflammation  this antibody greatly reduced bronchial lymphangiogenesis and regional lymphadenopathy and prolonged retinal graft survival in mice 
a candidate therapeutic fully human anti human vegfr antibody called hf c has been produced and its antagonist activity for vegfr has been verified 
research support for clinical programs imclone presently has five antibodies in various stages of clinical development fully human anti egf  anti igfr  anti vegfr  cdp and anti vegfr while all these agents are being assessed clinically as single agents  our research scientists are performing studies to determine which potential combinations would be most useful in future clinical studies 
these combinations include chemotherapeutic small molecules  signaling inhibitors and selective antibodies

collaborations with merck kgaa erbitux development and license agreement in december  the company entered into a development and license agreement with merck kgaa with respect to erbitux 
in exchange for granting merck kgaa exclusive rights to market erbitux outside of the united states and canada and co exclusive development rights in japan  the company received  through december  in up front cash fees and early cash payments based on the achievement of defined milestones 
an additional  was received through december  based upon the achievement of further milestones for which merck kgaa received equity in the company 
the chart below details the equity milestone payments received from merck kgaa during the three years ended december  date amount of milestone common shares issued to merck kgaa price per share may june july july december july the equity interests underlying the milestone payments were priced at varying premiums to the then market price of the common stock depending upon the timing of the achievement of the respective milestones 
merck kgaa pays us a royalty on sales of erbitux outside of the united states and canada 
in august  merck kgaa and we amended this agreement to provide  among other things  that merck kgaa may manufacture erbitux for supply in its territory and may utilize a third party to do so upon our reasonable acceptance 
the amendment further released merck kgaa from its obligations under the agreement relating to providing a guaranty under a  credit facility relating to the build out of bb in addition  the amendment provides that the companies have co exclusive rights to erbitux in japan  including the right to sublicense and merck kgaa waived its right of first offer in the case of a proposed sublicense by us of erbitux in our territory 
in consideration for the amendment  we agreed to a reduction in royalties payable by merck kgaa on sales of erbitux in merck kgaa s territory 
in september  the company entered into a binding term sheet  effective as of april   for the supply of erbitux to merck kgaa  which replaces previous supply arrangements 
the term sheet provides for merck kgaa to purchase bulk and finished erbitux ordered from us during the term of the december development and license agreement at a price equal to our fully loaded cost of goods 
the term sheet also provided for merck kgaa to use reasonable efforts to enter into its own contract manufacturing agreements for supply of erbitux and obligates merck kgaa to reimburse us for costs associated with transferring technology and any other services requested by merck kgaa relating to establishing its own manufacturing or contract manufacturing capacity 
in june  we agreed to supply a fixed quantity of erbitux for use in merck kgaa s medical affairs program on different ordering and pricing terms than those provided in the binding term sheet  including prepayment by merck kgaa for a portion of such supply 
we had recorded this prepayment as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the product was shipped to merck kgaa 
during  the company shipped some products under this agreement and the remaining quantity was shipped during bec research and license agreement effective april  we entered into an agreement with merck kgaa relating to the development and commercialization of bec and the recombinant gp antigen 
under this agreement we granted merck kgaa a license  with the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold bec and gp antigen outside north america  we granted merck kgaa a license  without the right to sublicense  to use  sell  or have sold  but not to make  bec within north america in conjunction with imclone systems  we retained the rights  without the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold bec in north america in conjunction with merck kgaa and with the right to sublicense  to make  have made  use  sell  or have sold gp antigen in north america  we were required to give merck kgaa the opportunity to negotiate a license in north america to gp antigen before granting such a license to any third party 
in return  merck kgaa made research support payments to us totaling  was required to make milestone payments to us of up to  of which  was received through december  based on milestones achieved in the product development of bec  was required to make royalty payments to us on all sales of the licensed products outside north america  if any  with a portion of the earlier funding received under the agreement being creditable against the amount of royalties due 
following an analysis of the results of various clinical studies involving bec and work relating to the recombinant gp antigen  we and merck kgaa determined to discontinue their further development and terminated the related agreement in ucb sa in august  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with ucb sa  a company registered in belgium  for the development and commercialization of cdp  ucb s novel  investigational pegylated di fab antibody targeting vegfr no upfront or milestone payments are payable under the agreement 
the agreement provides that we and ucb s 
a will share equally all agreed upon development costs for cdp as well as worldwide profits derived from the commercialization of cdp in indications jointly pursued by the parties 
we will also receive an incremental single digit royalty on net sales worldwide for such indications 
under certain circumstances  one party may be entitled to pursue in its territory an indication independently of the other party  which retains the option to join in the development or commercialization at a later stage 
we have exclusive commercialization rights to cdp in north america  with ucb receiving such rights in europe  japan  and the rest of the world 
we recorded an expense related to this agreement of approximately  for the year ended december  manufacturing imclone systems manufacturing facilities we own and operate a pilot manufacturing facility bb for biologics in branchburg  new jersey for the manufacture of clinical study materials 
at our pilot facility  we previously manufactured a portion of the erbitux utilized for clinical studies 
we now are using our pilot facility for supporting the scale up of erbitux manufacturing process improvements  developing the cell culture and purification processes for new antibodies and producing antibodies for anticipated clinical studies 
our pilot facility is operated in accordance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp  which is a requirement for product manufactured for use in clinical studies and for commercial sale 
production of erbitux in commercial quantities required the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and the hiring and training of additional personnel 
in july  we completed construction of an  square foot manufacturing facility  bb  on our branchburg  new jersey campus 
bb contains three  liter production volume fermenters and is dedicated to the clinical and commercial production of erbitux 
the construction of bb cost a total of approximately  excluding capitalized interest of approximately  bb was ready for its intended use and was put into operation in july in december  swissmedic approved erbitux manufactured at bb for commercial use in switzerland  in addition to erbitux manufactured at a european contract manufacturing site boehringer ingelheim 
on june   the fda granted a license to the bb facility for us commercial supply 
in may  team biologics conducted a routine biannual cgmp inspection 
additionally  bb had a satisfactory cgmp inspection by the regierungspr sidium darmstadt that resulted in a product import license being granted to merck kgaa in april  covering the period november to october the regierungspr sidium completed and successfully closed a reinspection of bb in july another reinspection will be scheduled in approximately two years 
we constructed a  square foot multiple product manufacturing facility bb in branchburg  new jersey with capacity of up to  liters production volume 
mechanical completion of bb was reached in the fourth quarter of this facility has three distinct suites capable of producing up to three different products concurrently 
we also have the ability to produce multiple products at each of the three suites 
currently  we have fitted and are validating and commissioning suite and we plan to fully dedicate this suite to the production of erbitux 
we estimate to complete the validation and commissioning of suite by the end of the second quarter of  and begin production of erbitux for commercial use in the second half of we have fitted suite with equipment but have not determined when we will begin commissioning and validation of this suite 
at this point  suite remains vacant until further determination of its ultimate use 
management estimates that this facility will cost approximately  including approximately  of costs related to the commissioning and validation of suite this estimate may change depending on various factors  particularly costs estimated to be incurred for external contractors assisting us in the validation and commissioning of suite this estimate does not include costs associated with the eventual commissioning and validation of suite or the fitting  commissioning and validation of suite in addition  we will also spend approximately million in laboratory equipment and incur approximately million in capitalized interest that is not included in the total estimated cost described above 
we have incurred approximately  in conceptual design  engineering  pre construction and construction costs  excluding capitalized interest of approximately  through december  as of december   committed purchase orders totaling approximately  have been placed with subcontractors for equipment related to this project and  for engineering  procurement  construction management and validation costs 
through december    has been paid relating to these committed purchase orders 
contract manufacturing on march   the company entered into a five year multi product supply agreement the agreement with lonza biologics plc lonza for the manufacture of biological material at the  liter scale 
the company has discretion over which products to manufacture  which may include later stage clinical production of the company s antibodies currently in phase i clinical testing and those nearing phase i testing 
the value of producing all batches allocated under the agreement is approximately million  unless terminated earlier 
the agreement provides that the company can cancel any batches at any time  however  depending on how much notice the company provides lonza  the company could incur a cancellation fee that varies based on timing of the cancellation 
this cancellation fee is only applicable if lonza does not resell the slots reserved for the cancelled batches 
in september  we entered into a three year commercial manufacturing services agreement with lonza relating to erbitux 
this agreement was amended in june  september  and august to include additional services and potentially to extend the term of the agreement 
all existing commitments under this agreement were completed during the year ended december   but an august amendment to the agreement allows for potential manufacture of a limited number of additional batches 
the total cost for services to be provided under the commercial manufacturing services agreement was approximately  we incurred costs of  for the year ended december  and  was incurred from inception through december   for services provided under the commercial manufacturing services agreement 
as of december   our commitment to lonza under this agreement was completed 
the entire erbitux inventory produced by lonza was consumed in clinical trials and used for commercial distribution during we rely entirely on a third party manufacturer for filling and finishing services with respect to erbitux 
if our current third party manufacturers or critical raw material suppliers fail to meet our expectations  we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into new agreements with other suppliers or third party manufacturers without an adverse effect on our business 
marketing and sales pursuant to the terms of the commercial agreement  er squibb has primary responsibility for distribution  marketing and sales of erbitux in the united states and canada and will provide sales force personnel and marketing services for erbitux 
we have the right  at our election and sole expense  to co promote erbitux with er squibb 
as part of our strategy to develop the capacity to market our cancer therapeutic products  we have exercised this co promotion right and are therefore entitled to have our field organization participate in activities supporting the sale and further commercial launch of erbitux 
pursuant to the terms of the commercial agreement  er squibb retains the exclusive rights to sell and distribute the product 
pursuant to our co promotion rights  during the third quarter of the company decided to establish a field force of oncology sales professionals to increase the company s presence and prominence within the oncology community and help maximize the market potential for erbitux in its approved indications 
we will continue to evaluate future arrangements and opportunities with respect to other products we may develop in order to optimize our profits and our distribution  marketing and sales capabilities 
patents and trademarks general we seek patent protection for our proprietary technology and products in the united states and abroad 
patent applications have been submitted and are pending in the united states  canada  europe and japan  as well as other countries 
the patent position of biopharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal questions 
our success will depend  in part  on whether we can obtain patents to protect our own products  obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties  which may be protected by patents  protect our trade secrets and know how  and operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others 
patent rights  licenses we currently have exclusive licenses or assignments to issued patents worldwide that relate to our proprietary technology in the united states and foreign countries  of which are issued united states patents 
in addition  we currently have exclusive licenses or assignments to approximately families of patent applications 
erbitux 
we have an exclusive license from the university of california to an issued united states patent for the murine form of erbitux  our egfr antibody product 
we believe that this patent s scope should be its literal claim scope as well as other antibodies not literally embraced but potentially covered under the patent law doctrine of equivalents 
whether or not a particular antibody is found to be an equivalent to the antibodies literally covered by the patent can only be determined at the time of a potential infringement  and in view of the technical details of the potentially infringing antibody in question 
our licensor of this patent did not obtain patent protection outside the united states for this antibody 
we are pursuing additional patent protection relating to the field of egfr antibodies in the treatment of cancer that may limit the ability of third parties to commercialize egfr antibodies for such use 
specifically  we are pursuing patent protection for the use of egfr antibodies in combination with chemotherapy to inhibit tumors or tumor growth 
we have exclusively licensed from rhone poulenc rorer pharmaceuticals  now known as sanofi aventis  patent applications seeking to cover the therapeutic use of antibodies to the egfr in conjunction with anti neoplastic agents 
a us patent  a canadian patent and a european patent were issued in this family 
in december  opposition proceedings seeking to revoke the european patent were brought by the scripps research institute  amgen inc  abgenix  inc  and ym biosciences inc 
an opposition proceeding is an administrative process  the outcome of which may be that our european patent will be revoked 
the company has vigorously defended its position in this matter  which is suspended pending the outcome of the yeda matter discussed under item  legal proceedings 
we have filed additional patent applications  based in part on our own research  that would cover the use of erbitux and other egfr antibodies in conjunction with radiation therapy  and the use of erbitux and other egfr inhibitors in refractory patients  either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy 
we have also filed patent applications that include claims on the use of conjugated forms of erbitux  as well as humanized forms of the antibody and fragments 
our license agreements with the university of california and sanofi aventis require us to pay royalties on sales of erbitux that are covered by these licenses 
we have entered into license agreements with genentech for rights to patents covering certain use of epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and with both genentech and centocor for rights to patents covering various aspects of antibody technology 
our agreements with both genentech and centocor require us to pay royalties on the sale of erbitux that are covered by these licenses 
there can be no assurance that patent applications related to the field of antibodies in the treatment of cancer to which we hold rights will result in the issuance of patents  that any patents issued or licensed to our company related to erbitux or its use will not be challenged and held to be invalid or of a scope of coverage that is different from what we believe the patent s scope to be  or that our present or future patents related to these technologies will ultimately provide adequate patent coverage for or protection of our present or future egfr antibody technologies  products or processes 
until recently  patent applications were secret until patents were issued in the us  or corresponding applications were published in foreign countries  and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make our inventions  or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
in addition  patents do not give the holder the right to commercialize technology covered by the patents  should our production or our use be found by a court to be embraced by the patent of another 
in the event that we are called upon to defend and or prosecute patent suits and or related legal or administrative proceedings  such proceedings are costly and time consuming and could result in loss of our patent rights  infringement penalties or both 
litigation and patent interference proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of efforts by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in any such interference proceedings or in patent litigation  particularly with respect to erbitux  to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
if required  the necessary licenses may not be available on acceptable financial or other terms or at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us  in whole or in part  from commercializing our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that there is patent litigation involving one or more of the patents issued to us  there can be no guarantee that the patents will be held valid and enforceable 
the scope of patents may be called into question and could result in a decision by a court that the claims have a different scope than we believe them to have 
further  the outcome of patent litigation is subject to intangibles that cannot be adequately quantified in advance  including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses that will be called to testify and the identity of the adverse party 
this is especially true in biotechnology related patent cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims in patent suits  that one or more of our products or processes infringe third parties patents or violate the proprietary rights of third parties 
defense and prosecution of such patent suits can result in the diversion of substantial financial  management and other resources from our other activities 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability to third parties  require us to obtain licenses from third parties  or require that we cease any related product development activities or product sales 
an adverse determination by a court in any such patent litigation  or by the us patent and trademark office in a patent interference proceeding  particularly with respect to erbitux  to which we may become a party  could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties  or result in loss in whole or part of our ability to continue to sell our product 
if required  the necessary licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us  in whole or in part  from commercializing our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
angiogenesis inhibitors 
with respect to our research on inhibitors to angiogenesis based on the flk receptor vegfr  we are the exclusive licensee from princeton university of a family of patents and patent applications covering recombinant nucleic acid molecules that encode the murine flk receptor and antibodies to extracellular portions of the receptor and its human homolog  kdr 
we are also the assignee of a family of patents and patent applications filed by our scientists generally related to angiogenesis inhibiting antibodies to receptors that bind vegf  for example human flt vegfr and kdr vegfr 
one of the patents licensed from princeton university claims the use of flk receptor antibodies to isolate cells expressing the flk receptor on their cell surfaces 
additionally  we are a co owner of a patent application claiming the use of flk kdr receptor antibodies to isolate endothelial stem cells that express flk kdr on their cell surfaces 
at present  we are seeking exclusive rights to this invention from the co owners 
we have an exclusive license from the ludwig institute for cancer research for patent rights pertaining to antibodies that specifically bind flt vegfr and their use in cancer 
our license from princeton university requires us to pay royalties on sales that would otherwise infringe the licensed patents  which cover antibodies to the flk kdr receptor 
imc b and other antibodies of the imc kdr family are fully human monoclonal antibodies 
patents have been issued to other biotechnology companies that relate to the selection of fully human antibodies or their manufacture 
therefore  though we have licensed such patents from certain companies in this field we may be required to obtain additional licenses before we can commercialize our own fully human monoclonal antibodies  including imc b 
we cannot be certain that we will ever be able to obtain such additional patent licenses related to fully human and or phage derived monoclonal antibodies in the us or in other territories of the world where we would want to commercialize such imc kdr antibodies 
even if we are able to obtain other licenses as requested  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on financial or other terms acceptable to us or that we would be able to successfully redesign our products or processes to avoid the scope of such patents 
in either such case  such inability could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot guarantee that the cost of such licenses would not materially affect the ability to commercialize imc kdr antibodies 
there can be no assurance that others will not be  or have not been  issued patents that may prevent the sale of one or more of our products or the practice of one or more of our processes  or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by us to third parties in order to enable us to conduct business 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that one or more of our products or processes infringe other patents or violate the proprietary rights of third parties 
in the event that we are called upon to defend and or prosecute patent suits  the related legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and time consuming and could result in loss of patent rights  infringement penalties or both 
in addition  defense and prosecution of patent suits can result in the diversion of substantial financial  management and other resources from our other activities 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability to third parties  require us to obtain licenses from third parties  or require us to cease any related product development activities or product sales and might have a material adverse effect on our business 
ve cadherin 
we have obtained an exclusive license from icos corporation to certain patent rights pertaining to ve cadherin and antibodies thereto for the treatment of cancer in humans 
we are also the assignee of a family of patent applications filed by an employee related to methods of generating therapeutically valuable antibodies that bind ve cadherins 
these two families of patent applications cover cadherin molecules that are involved in endothelial cell interactions 
these interactions are believed to be involved in angiogenic processes 
the subject patents and patent applications also cover antibodies that bind to  and affect the cadherin molecules 
our license from icos requires us to pay royalties on the sale of certain ve cadherin antibodies 
phage display technology 
a number of antibodies that we are developing  including our fully human anti egfr monoclonal antibody imc f and our fully human anti kdr monoclonal antibody imc b are phage derived antibodies  which means they are made using phage technology 
since patents have been issued to biotechnology companies that relate to phage derived antibodies and their manufacture  we may be required to obtain licenses under these patents before we can commercialize certain phage derived antibodies 
in march  we entered into a license with dyax corp 
dyax for certain of dyax s patent rights and know how covering certain phage display technology and a proprietary phage display library 
this license also includes sublicense or non enforcement covenant rights from other companies that possess patent and other intellectual property rights relating to phage display technology 
we believe  though we cannot be certain  that this license will provide us with the freedom to operate in the development of imc f and imc b as well as certain other phage derived antibodies 
trademarks 
erbitux  erbitux cetuximab antibody design logo  imclone  imclone systems  imclone systems incorporated  targeted oncology and the antibody design pantone orange  our corporate icon  are trademarks and or service marks of imclone systems incorporated 
applications are pending or registrations have been issued for various of these marks in the united states and or foreign jurisdictions 
in october  exxon mobil corporation filed a notice of opposition against our erbitux cetuximab antibody design logo 
an opposition in the us patent and trademark office is an administrative process  the outcome of which may be the rejection of the company s federal trademark application 
the company is negotiating with exxon mobil to resolve this matter 
trade secrets 
with respect to certain aspects of our technology  we rely  and intend to continue to rely  on our confidential trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to protect our competitive position 
such aspects of our technology include methods of isolating and purifying antibodies and other proteins  collections of plasmids in viable host systems  and antibodies that are specific for proteins that are of interest to us 
we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques  or that we are free of the patent or other rights of third parties to commercialize this technology 
relationships between us and our employees  scientific consultants and collaborators provide these persons with access to our trade secrets  know how and technological innovation under confidentiality agreements with the parties involved 
similarly  our employees and consultants enter into agreements with us that require that they do not disclose confidential information of ours and that they assign to us all rights to any inventions relating to our activities made while in our employ or while consulting for us 
government regulation the research and development  manufacture and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products are subject to regulation  primarily by the fda in the united states and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  research and development activities including testing in animals and in humans and the testing  manufacturing  handling  labeling  storage  distribution  import  export  record keeping  reporting  approval  advertising and promotion of the products that we are developing 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in various adverse consequences  including delay in approval or refusal to approve product licenses or other applications  suspension or termination of clinical investigations  revocation of approvals previously granted  fines  criminal prosecution  recall or seizure of products  injunctions against shipping products and total or partial suspension of production and or refusal to allow a company to enter into governmental supply contracts 
the process of obtaining requisite fda approval has historically been costly  time consuming  and uncertain 
current fda requirements for a new human drug or biological product to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of pre clinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct human clinical studies for drugs or biologics  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a new drug application nda for a drug product or a bla for a biological product to allow commercial distribution of the drug or biologic  and fda review of whether the facility in which the drug or biologic is manufactured  processed  packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product s continued quality 
overall  conducting clinical studies is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
pre clinical tests include the evaluation of the product in the laboratory and in animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulation 
the results of the pre clinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind to support the evaluation of the product in human patients 
historically  the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical studies have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical studies 
a number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in early clinical studies  but for which there was a subsequent failure to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors  including changes in regulatory policy during the period of pre clinical and clinical development 
clinical studies involve administration of the product to patients under supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
such studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into human patients  the product is generally tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution  and excretion 
phase ii typically involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the biological or clinical activity of the product for specific  targeted indications  determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if phase ii evaluations indicate that a product is effective and has an acceptable benefit to risk relationship  phase iii studies may be undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population 
phase iii studies are often the pivotal studies upon which commercial approval is sought  although earlier phase studies can sometimes support approval  particularly in the case of products approved on an accelerated or fast track basis 
phase iv studies  or post regulatory approval studies  may also be required to provide additional data on safety or efficacy 
united states law requires that studies conducted to support approval for product marketing be adequate and well controlled 
in general  this means that either a placebo or a product already approved for the treatment of the disease or condition under study must be used as a reference control 
studies must also be conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including good clinical practice  or gcp  and informed consent requirements 
the fda may prevent clinical studies from beginning if  among other reasons  it concludes that clinical subjects would be exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
studies may also be prevented from beginning by institutional review boards  who must review and approve all research involving human subjects 
the fda and institutional review boards review the results of the clinical studies and may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of clinical studies at any time if they believe the product candidate exposes clinical subjects to an unacceptable health risk 
investigational products used in clinical studies must be produced in compliance with cgmp pursuant to fda regulations 
side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical studies can delay  impede  or prevent regulatory approval 
similarly  adverse events that are reported after regulatory approval can result in additional limitations being placed on a product s use and  potentially  withdrawal of the product from the market 
any adverse event  either before or after marketing authorization  can result in product liability claims against the company 
during the course of  and following the completion of clinical studies  the data are analyzed to determine whether the studies successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness  and whether a product approval application may be submitted 
in the united states  if the product is regulated as a drug  a new drug application  or nda  must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin 
if the product is regulated as a biologic  such as antibodies  a biologics license application  or bla  must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin 
the fda center for drug evaluation and research  or cder  has responsibility for the review and approval of drugs  and  following reorganization at fda  also has responsibility for the review and approval of certain therapeutic biologics such as monoclonal antibodies  cytokines  growth factors  enzymes  interferons and certain proteins 
the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  or cber  has responsibility for other biologics 
based on this re distribution of responsibility  we expect that most of our products will be reviewed by cder 
the nda or bla must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness and  in the case of a biologic  purity and potency of the compound from laboratory  animal and clinical testing  as well as data and information on manufacturing  product stability  and proposed product labeling 
under the prescription drug user fee act  as amended  the fda receives fees for reviewing an nda or bla and supplements thereto  as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products 
these fees can be significant 
the nda or bla review fee alone can exceed  although certain limited deferrals  waivers and reductions may be available 
under applicable laws and fda regulations  each nda or bla submitted for fda approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within to days following submission of the application 
if deemed complete  the fda will file the nda or bla  thereby triggering substantive review of the application 
the fda can refuse to file any nda or bla that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable 
if the fda refuses to file an application  the fda will retain percent of the user fee as a penalty 
the fda has established performance goals for the review of ndas and blas six months for priority applications and ten months for regular applications 
however  the fda is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these performance goals may change over time 
moreover  the outcome of the review  even if generally favorable  typically is not an actual approval but an action letter that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved 
the fda s review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent fda advisory committee 
even if the fda approves a product  it may limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling  require that warning statements be included in the product labeling  require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval  impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution  prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan  or otherwise limit the scope of any approval 
some of our cancer treatments may be used in conjuction with in vitro diagnostic products to test patients for particular traits 
in vitro diagnostic products are generally regulated by the fda as medical devices 
before a medical device may be marketed in the united states  the manufacturer generally must obtain either clearance through a k pre market notification k process or approval through the pre market approval application pma process 
section k notifications may be filed only for those devices that are substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device 
if a device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device  a pma must be filed 
the pre market approval procedure generally involves more complex and lengthy testing  and a longer review process than the k process 
under current law  each domestic and foreign drug and device product manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda before product approval 
domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must meet strict standards for compliance with cgmp regulations and licensing specifications after the fda has approved an nda  bla or pma for a product manufactured at such facility 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities periodically inspect domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities where applicable 
significant additional legal and regulatory requirements also apply after fda approval to market under an nda or bla 
along with the requirement for ongoing adherence to cgmps these requirements include  among other things  requirements related to adverse events and other reporting  product advertising and promotion  and the need to submit appropriate new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product  product labeling or manufacturing process 
the fda also enforces the requirements of the prescription drug marketing act  or pdma  which  among other things  imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians 
in the united states  the research  manufacturing  distribution  sale  and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in addition to the fda  including the centers for medicare and medicaid services formerly the health care financing administration  other divisions of the united states department of health and human services eg  the office of inspector general  and state and local governments 
for example  sales and marketing and medical affairs programs must comply with a variety of federal  state and local laws  and regulations and principles  such as the medicare medicaid anti fraud and abuse act  as amended  the false claims act  also as amended  the privacy provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  and the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america code on interactions with healthcare professionals 
pricing and rebate programs must comply with the medicaid rebate requirements of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of  as amended 
if products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule of the general services administration  additional laws and requirements apply 
all of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 
moreover  we are now  and may become subject to  additional federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies relating to safe working conditions  laboratory practices  the experimental use of animals  and or the use  storage  handling  transportation and disposal of human tissue  waste and hazardous substances  including radioactive and toxic materials and infectious disease agents used in conjunction with our research work 
sales outside the united states of products we develop will also be subject to regulatory requirements governing human clinical studies and marketing for drugs and biological products and devices 
the requirements vary widely from country to country  but typically the registration and approval process takes several years and requires significant resources 
in most cases  if the fda has not approved a product for sale in the united states the product may be exported to any country if it complies with the laws of that country and has valid marketing authorization by the appropriate authority in canada  australia  new zealand  japan  israel  switzerland or south africa  or in the european union or a country in the european economic area if the drug is marketed in that country or the drug is authorized for general marketing in the european economic area 
there are specific fda regulations that govern this process 
our ability to earn sufficient returns on our products may depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations will provide reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available 
in the united states  debate over the reform of the health care system has resulted in an increased focus on pricing 
although there are currently no government price controls over private sector purchases in the united states  federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under certain public health care programs 
various states have adopted mechanisms under medicaid and otherwise that seek to control drug prices  including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers 
in the absence of new government regulation  managed care has become a potent force in the market place that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products 
new federal legislation  enacted in december  has altered the way in which physician administered drugs covered by medicare are reimbursed  generally leading to lower reimbursement for physicians 
as of january   physicians are reimbursed for physician administered drugs  such as erbitux  based on the average sales price of the drug plus six percent 
the average sales price is the average net price of a drug to all non federal purchasers 
price discounts will affect the drug reimbursement rates 
to date  the company has not discounted the sale of erbitux to non federal purchasers  other than routine prompt payment discounts 
this focus on pricing has led to other adverse government action  and may lead to other action in the future 
for example  in december federal legislation was enacted to change united states import laws and expand the ability to import lower priced versions of pharmaceutical products from canada  where there are government price controls 
these changes to the import laws will not take effect unless and until the secretary of health and human services certifies that the changes will lead to substantial savings for consumers and will not create a public health safety issue 
the current secretary of health and human services has indicated that there is not a basis to make such a certification at this time 
however  it is possible that this secretary or a subsequent secretary could make the certification in the future 
in addition  legislative proposals have been made to implement the changes to the import laws without any certification  and to broaden permissible imports in other ways 
even if the changes to the import laws do not take effect  and other changes are not enacted  imports from canada and elsewhere may increase due to market and political forces  and the limited enforcement resources of the fda  the customs service  and other government agencies 
for example  numerous states and localities have proposed programs to facilitate canadian imports  and at least one locality has already begun such a program  notwithstanding questions raised by fda about the legality of such actions 
we expect that pressures on pricing results will continue 
in the eu  governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers 
the approach taken varies from member state to member state 
some jurisdictions operate positive and or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed 
other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines  but monitor and control company profits 
the downward pressure on health care costs in general  particularly prescription drugs  has become very intense 
as a result  increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products  as exemplified by the national institute for clinical excellence in the united kingdom which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government 
in addition  in some countries cross border imports from low priced markets parallel imports exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country 
in japan  the national health ministry biannually reviews the pharmaceutical prices of individual products 
in the past  these reviews have resulted in price reductions 
environmental and safety matters we use hazardous chemicals  biological agents and various radioactive isotopes and compounds in our research and development and our manufacturing activities 
accordingly  we are subject to and seek to comply with  applicable regulations under federal  state and local laws regarding employee safety  environmental protection and hazardous substance control 
we have made and will continue to make expenditures for environmental compliance  environmental protection and employee safety 
such expenditures have not had  and in the opinion of management are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operation  capital expenditures or competitive position 
however  these laws may change  our processes may change  or other facts may emerge which could affect our operations  business or assets and therefore the amount and timing of expenditures in the future may vary substantially from those currently anticipated 
competition competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and based significantly on scientific  technological and market factors 
these factors include the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products  the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain governmental approval for testing  manufacturing and marketing 
we compete with specialized biopharmaceutical firms in the united states  europe and elsewhere  as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies that are applying biotechnology to their operations 
many biopharmaceutical and large pharmaceutical companies have focused their development efforts in the human therapeutics area  including cancer 
many major pharmaceutical companies have developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies 
further  such companies have substantially greater financial resources and greater access to the capital markets than we do 
these companies  as well as academic institutions  governmental agencies and private research organizations  also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific  technical and professional personnel and consultants 
we are aware of certain products under development or manufactured by competitors that are used or marketed for the prevention  diagnosis  or treatment of certain diseases that we have targeted for product development 
various companies are developing or commercializing biopharmaceutical products that potentially compete directly with our commercial product and product candidates 
these include areas such as the use of biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical products targeted to the egfr or antibodies to that receptor to treat cancer  the development of inhibitors to angiogenesis  and the use of recombinant antigen approaches to cancer vaccines 
currently there are two small molecule egfr inhibitors approved by the fda 
osi pharmaceuticals  inc and genentech  inc received approval from the fda for tarceva erlotinib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen 
astrazeneca pharmaceuticals received approval from the fda for iressa gefitinib  a small molecule egfr inhibitor indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer after failure of both platinum based and docetaxel chemotherapies 
in addition  several product candidates are in advanced stages of clinical studies 
we are aware of several companies that have potential antibody or other product candidates in clinical testing that target the egfr and therefore may compete with our lead product  erbitux 
these companies include  but are not limited to abgenix  inc in collaboration with amgen  inc the most clinically advanced of these potential competitors  have stated publicly that they have initiated a rolling bla for their monoclonal antibody  panitumumab  for refractory colorectal cancer pfizer  inc  glaxosmithkline plc  novartis  merck kgaa  wyeth  medarex  and ym bioscience inc on february   genentech received fda approval for avastin for treatment in first line metastatic colorectal cancer 
avastin is an approved therapeutic antibody designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor vegf 
while avastin does not target the egfr and is indicated for a patient population different than the patient population in the pivotal studies we submitted as the basis of the fda s approval for erbitux ie  previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer patients versus irinotecan refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients  it is competing significantly with erbitux as a treatment for colorectal cancer and may compete significantly with erbitux as a treatment for other cancers 
we believe that  notwithstanding the fact that the fda has approved avastin and erbitux for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in different indications  physicians have prescribed avastin outside of its approved indication and within erbitux s approved indications 
if physicians continue or accelerate such prescription of avastin outside of its approved indication  the prescription volume or market share of erbitux within its approved indication may be limited or may diminish 
we expect that our products under development and in clinical studies will address major markets within the cancer sector  and potentially markets in other therapeutic areas 
our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities 
additionally  the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors products may be an important competitive factor 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can develop products  complete pre clinical testing  clinical studies and approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors 
we expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors  including product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price  patent position  manufacturing capacity and capability  distribution capability and government action 
our employees we have assembled a qualified business  professional and scientific staff with a variety of complementary skills in a broad base of areas  including legal  finance  advanced research technologies  oncology  immunology  molecular and cell biology  antibody engineering  protein and medicinal chemistry and high throughput screening 
we believe that we have been successful to date in attracting and retaining skilled and experienced business and scientific professionals 
we have also recruited a staff of technical and professional employees to carry out manufacturing at our branchburg  new jersey facilities 
of our full time personnel on february   were employed at our new jersey facilities and were employed at our new york headquarters 
our staff includes persons with phd s and with md s 
industry segment we operate in only one industry segment biotechnology 
we do not have any foreign operations  and our business is not seasonal

risk factors risks relating to our business and other matters the outcome of the review of our strategic alternatives currently being performed by the company with the assistance of lazard is uncertain 
we recently announced that our board of directors has engaged the investment bank lazard to conduct  in conjunction with management  a full review of the company s strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value 
these alternatives could include a merger  sale or strategic alliance 
we are proceeding in consultation with our existing partners as the process moves forward 
it is uncertain whether any particular strategic alternative will be pursued or that any transaction will occur  or on what terms 
we do not plan to release additional information about the status of the review of alternatives until a definitive agreement is entered into or the process is otherwise completed 
royalty and manufacturing revenue from sales of erbitux represent a substantial portion of our revenues 
if erbitux does not receive continued market acceptance  sales may not continue and we may not earn sufficient revenues 
our future growth and a significant portion of our future revenues depend on the continued commercial success of erbitux  our only fda approved product 
we cannot be certain that erbitux will continue to be licensed or approved in the united states or in any foreign market 
a number of factors may affect the rate and level of market acceptance of erbitux  including the perception by physicians and other members of the healthcare community of erbitux s safety or efficacy or that of competing products  the effectiveness of our and bms sales and marketing efforts in the united states and the effectiveness of merck kgaa s sales and marketing efforts outside the united states  the ability to obtain additional fda approvals to market erbitux in additional treatment indications and tumor types  any unfavorable publicity concerning erbitux or competitive drugs  the price of erbitux relative to other drugs or competing treatments  the availability and level of third party reimbursement for sales of erbitux  the continued availability of adequate supplies of erbitux to meet demand  and regulatory developments related to the manufacture or continued use of erbitux 
if erbitux does not continue to be accepted  our revenues would decline  which would impact our profitability and the price of our common stock 
we depend on bms and merck kgaa to co promote market and sell erbitux 
if either bms or merck kgaa becomes unable to meet its obligations  or we fail to adequately maintain our relationship with these partners  it would negatively impact our revenues and harm our business 
under our agreement with bms  bms has the exclusive right to distribute erbitux in the united states and canada  in exchange for which we receive royalty payments of of bms net sales of erbitux in the united states and canada 
under our agreement with merck kgaa  merck has the exclusive right to market erbitux outside of the united states  canada and japan  in exchange for which we receive royalty payments based on merck s gross profit from erbitux sales 
these royalty payments from bms and merck represent a significant portion of our current revenues 
in addition  we receive milestone payments and reimbursements of various regulatory and clinical expenses as well as certain marketing and administrative expenses from bms and merck 
our reliance on these relationships creates a number of potential risks  including the risk that we may be unable to control whether our corporate partners devote sufficient resources to our programs or product 
if either bms or merck becomes unable to market effectively and sell sufficient quantities of erbitux  or otherwise unable to meet its contractual obligations  our revenues would be negatively impacted and it would harm our business 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  including in terms of product pricing  that is subject to rapid and significant technological change 
the pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms 
certain of these companies have considerably greater financial  research  clinical  regulatory  manufacturing  and marketing resources than we do 
we have already experienced significant competition to erbitux from avastin bevacizumab a non chemotherapeutic biopharmaceutical product manufactured by genentech  inc and approved by the fda as a first line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and xeloda a chemotherapeutic biopharmaceutical product manufactured by roche laboratories  inc and also approved by the fda as a first line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
we believe that  notwithstanding the fact that the fda has approved avastin  xeloda and erbitux for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in different indications  physicians have prescribed avastin and xeloda outside of their approved indications and within erbitux s approved indications 
we are also aware of products in development at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies that  if successful in clinical trials and approved for marketing  may be priced competitively and compete with erbitux for the indication for which we have fda approval  or for indications for which we are seeking  or may seek  fda approval 
business combinations among our competitors may increase competition and the resources available to these competitors 
in addition  the pharmaceutical industry has undergone  and is expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change  and we expect competition to increase with technical advances 
the development of products or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our product or product candidates  we will not be able to market our product or further develop our product candidates 
we are subject to stringent regulation with respect to product safety and efficacy by various international and us federal  state and local authorities 
of particular significance are the fda s requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
any biopharmaceutical that we may develop cannot be marketed in the united states until it has been approved by the fda  and then can only be marketed for the indications and claims approved by the fda 
as a result of these requirements  the length of time  the level of expenditures and the laboratory and clinical information required for approval of an nda or a bla  or any supplements thereto  are substantial and can require a number of years  and the ability to obtain regulatory approval is uncertain 
in addition  after any of our products receives regulatory approval  it remains subject to ongoing fda regulation  including with respect to  for example  changes to the product  its manufacturing or label  new or revised regulatory requirements for manufacturing practices  additional clinical study requirements  restricted distribution  written warnings to physicians  a product recall  and withdrawal of a previously obtained approval 
similarly extensive regulation exists outside of the united states  including in europe and japan 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to receive necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all  for any of the product candidates we are developing or that we can maintain or receive any additional necessary regulatory approvals for erbitux 
any delay in obtaining such approval or failure to maintain regulatory approvals could prevent us from marketing our product and would have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  it is possible that the current regulatory framework could change or additional regulations could arise at any stage during our product development or marketing processes  which may affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products 
our revenues will diminish if our collaborators fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for erbitux from third party payors 
all our revenues from erbitux are based on sales of the product by our two collaborators  bms and merck kgaa 
the continuing efforts of us and foreign government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit the revenues that we earn from these sales of erbitux 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product  physicians may not prescribe it 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  there is  and we expect that there will continue to be  federal  state and local legislation aimed at imposing similar controls 
in addition  we expect managed care initiatives in the united states to continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
cost control initiatives would decrease the price received by our collaborators for any of our products in the future 
further  cost control initiatives would impair or diminish our ability or incentive  or the ability or incentive of our partners or potential partners  to commercialize our other product candidates  and accordingly  our ability to earn revenues 
our ability to commercialize any other product candidates  alone or with collaborators  will continue to depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from government and health administration authorities  including medicare and medicaid  private health insurers  and other third party payors 
third party payors  including medicare  are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and level of reimbursement for new drugs and  in some cases  refusing to provide coverage for a patient s use of an approved drug for purposes not approved by the fda 
our royalty and collaborative agreement revenues could vary significantly and may adversely impact our business 
royalty and collaborative agreement revenues in future periods could vary significantly 
major factors affecting these revenues include  but are not limited to variations in bms and merck kgaa s and other licensees sales of licensed products  the expiration or termination of existing arrangements with our collaborative partners  particularly merck kgaa and bms  which may include development and marketing arrangements for our products in the us  europe and other countries outside the united states  the timing of us and us approvals  if any  for our products licensed to bms  merck kgaa and other licensees  the initiation of new collaborative agreements with other companies  whether and when collaborative agreement benchmarks and milestones are achieved  the failure or refusal of a licensee to pay royalties  the expiration or invalidation of our patents or licensed intellectual property  decreases in licensees sales of our products due to competition  manufacturing difficulties or other factors affecting sales of products  including any safety issues  and disputes arising with respect to the interpretation of provisions in existing or future agreements with our collaborative partners 
if we are unable to earn sufficient revenues from erbitux  our operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
we will be required to expend significant resources for research and development of our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully  which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth and our stock price 
our only approved product is erbitux while our product candidates are still undergoing clinical trials and are in the early stages of development 
any successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and depends on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  each of our product candidates under development will require significant additional research and development resources to be expended prior to their commercialization 
even if we spend substantial amounts on research and development  our potential products may not be developed successfully 
if the product candidates on which we have expended significant amounts for research and development are not commercialized  we will not earn a return on their research and development expenditures  which would adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth and our stock price 
difficulties or delays in product manufacturing and finishing could cause shortfalls in the supply of erbitux or our product candidates currently being developed which would harm our business and  in the case of erbitux  our ability to meet our financial obligations 
cardinal health inc is currently our sole provider of filling and finishing services the final stage of manufacturing for erbitux 
in addition  we currently manufacture erbitux at our bb manufacturing facility and through cardinal health inc any prolonged interruption in the operations of our or our contractors manufacturing and finishing facilities could result in cancellations of shipments  loss of product in the process of being manufactured  or a shortfall of available product inventory 
a number of factors could cause interruptions  including a failure of our or our contractors manufacturing and finishing facilities to obtain fda approval and maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements  changes in the fda s regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our manufacturing processes  action by the fda that results in the halting of production of one or more of our products due to regulatory issues  a contract manufacturer going out of business  natural or other disasters  or other similar factors 
because our manufacturing and finishing processes and those of our contractors are highly complex and are subject to a lengthy fda approval process and extensive ongoing regulation  alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all 
we may also experience insufficient available capacity to manufacture existing or new products which could cause shortfalls of available product inventory 
difficulties or delays in our and our contractors manufacturing and supply of existing or new products could increase our costs  cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation 
although the fda has approved our bb manufacturing facilities and the facilities have passed multiple subsequent inspections  if we are unable to maintain fda approval for bb  it may cause shortfalls in our product inventory which would negatively impact our revenues and our business 
our marketing partners may experience pressure to lower the price of erbitux because of new and or proposed federal legislation  which would reduce our royalty revenue and may harm our business 
federal legislation enacted in december altered the way in which physician administered drugs covered by medicare  such as erbitux  are reimbursed  generally leading to lower reimbursement levels 
this legislation also added an outpatient prescription drug benefit to medicare  effective january the outpatient prescription drug benefit is provided primarily through private entities  which will attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers  including our collaborators 
these negotiations may increase pressures to lower pricing for erbitux 
while the law specifically prohibits the united states government from interfering in price negotiations between manufacturers and medicare drug plan sponsors  some members of congress are pursuing legislation that would permit the united states government to use its enormous purchasing power to demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies  thereby creating de facto price controls on prescription drugs  such as erbitux 
in addition  the new law contains triggers for congressional consideration of cost containment measures for medicare in the event medicare cost increases exceed a certain level 
these cost containment measures could include some sorts of limitations on prescription drug prices that our collaborators charge for erbitux which would reduce our royalty revenue and harm our business 
if we become subject to importation of products from canada and other countries  it will affect our profitability and harm our business 
erbitux and other products that we may develop may become subject to competition from lower priced imports from canada  mexico and other countries where government price controls or other market dynamics have resulted in lower priced products 
the ability of patients and other customers to obtain these lower priced imports has grown significantly as a result of the internet  an expansion of pharmacies in canada and elsewhere targeted to american purchasers  the increase in us based businesses affiliated with canadian pharmacies marketing to american purchasers and other factors 
many of these foreign imports are illegal under current law 
however  the volume of imports continues to rise due to the limited enforcement resources of the fda and the us customs service  and the pressure in the current political environment to permit the imports as a mechanism for expanding access to lower priced medicines 
in addition  in december  federal legislation was enacted to modify united states import laws and expand the ability for lower priced pharmaceutical products to be imported from canada  where government price controls have been enacted 
these changes to the import laws will not take effect unless and until the secretary of health and human services certifies that the changes will lead to substantial savings for consumers and will not create a public health safety issue 
the current secretary of health and human services has indicated that there is not a basis to make such a certification at this time 
however  it is possible that this secretary or a subsequent secretary could make such a certification in the future 
in addition  legislation has been proposed to implement the changes to the import laws without any requirement for certification from the secretary of health and human services  and to broaden permissible imports in other ways 
even if these changes to the import laws do not take effect  and other changes are not enacted  lower priced imports of products from canada and elsewhere may continue to increase due to market and political forces  and the limited enforcement resources of the fda  the us customs service  and other government agencies 
for example  state and local governments have suggested that they may import drugs from canada for employees covered by state health plans or others  and some have already enacted such plans 
lower priced imports will adversely affect our profitability 
this impact could become more significant in the future  and the impact could be even greater if there is a further change in the law or if state or local governments take further steps to permit lower priced imports from abroad 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to develop our business 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our executive management and scientific personnel and our ability to recruit  train and retain highly qualified management  scientific  manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel 
if we lose the services of any of these personnel  our research and product development and marketing goals  including the maintenance of relationships with leading research institutions and key collaborators  could be delayed or curtailed 
in addition  we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
as a result  we may be unable to minimize the negative impact on our business stemming from the loss of a key employee 
the law or fda policy could change and expose us to competition from generic or follow on versions of our products  which may impact our market share and harm our business 
under current us law and fda policy  generic versions of conventional chemical drug compounds  sometimes referred to as small molecule compounds  may be approved through an abbreviated approval process 
in general terms  the generic applicant references an approved innovator product for which full clinical data demonstrating safety and effectiveness exist for the approved conditions of use 
the generic applicant in turn need only demonstrate that its product has the same active ingredient s  dosage form  strength  route of administration  and conditions of use labeling as the referenced innovator drug  and that the generic product is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as the referenced innovator drug this is known as bioequivalence 
in addition  the generic application must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality  and must contain certifications to patents listed with the fda for the referenced innovator drug 
there is no such abbreviated approval process under current law for biological products approved under the public health service act through a bla  such as monoclonal antibodies  cytokines  growth factors  enzymes  interferons and certain other proteins 
however  various proposals have been made to establish an abbreviated approval process to permit approval of generic or follow on versions of these types of biological products 
the proposals include proposals for legislation  and proposals for the fda to extend its existing authority to this area 
for example  some have proposed that the fda allow a generic or follow on copy of certain therapeutic biologics to be approved under an existing mechanism known as a b application 
a b application is a form of an nda  where the applicant does not have a right to reference some of the data being relied upon for approval 
under current regulations  b applications can be used where the applicant is relying in part on published literature or on findings of safety or effectiveness in another company s nda 
b applications have not been used to date for therapeutic biologic products 
in addition  the use of b applications even for conventional chemical drug products is the subject of ongoing legal challenge 
it is thus not clear what the permitted use of a b application might be in the future for biologics products  or whether any other proposals on generic or follow on biologics will be adopted 
however  if the law is changed or if the fda somehow extends its existing authority in new ways  and third parties are permitted to obtain approvals of versions of our products through an abbreviated approval mechanism and without conducting full clinical studies of their own  it could adversely affect our business 
such products would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market  and could lead to the existence of multiple lower priced competitive products 
this would substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those products 
risks relating to intellectual property and legal matters protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly 
if we fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights  we could lose revenue 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain  maintain and enforce our patents 
our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products 
in the absence of patent protection  competitors may cause a negative impact to our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent products and technology 
patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercialization of products 
we have in the past been  are currently  and may in the future be  involved in material patent litigation  such as the matters discussed under part i item legal proceedings 
patent litigation is time consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
in addition  an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute 
the existence of patents or other proprietary rights belonging to other parties may lead to our termination of the research and development of a particular product or cause us to obtain third party licenses at potentially material costs 
we believe that we have strong patent protection or the potential for strong patent protection for our product and product candidates 
however  it is for the courts and or other governmental agencies in the us and in other jurisdictions ultimately to determine the strength of that patent protection 
we hold patents or licenses to patents relating to murine antibodies as well as patents and licenses relating to the therapeutic use of egfr antibodies 
these patents expire on various dates  the earliest of which is in risks related to our patent position with respect to erbitux and our product candidates are more fully discussed under item business patents and trademarks 
several lawsuits have been filed against us which may result in litigation that is costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our business 
litigations or arbitrations to which we are currently or have been subjected relate to  among other things  our patent and other intellectual property rights  licensing arrangements with other persons and those other claims more fully described under part i item legal proceedings 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the outcome of these pending lawsuits or arbitrations 
any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  the costs to us of defending these claims or any other proceedings  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or other proceedings could also harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
our operations use hazardous materials  which may lead to environmental liability  and may harm our business 
we use certain hazardous materials in connection with our research and manufacturing activities 
these hazardous materials include various flammable solvents  corrosives  oxidizers and toxics 
we also use radioactive isotopes in our scientific research 
in the event such hazardous materials are stored  handled or released into the environment in violation of law or any permit  or in a manner that adversely affects the environment  we could be subject to loss of our permits  government fines or penalties and or other adverse governmental or third party action 
we do not maintain any specific insurance to cover any accidents associated with the hazardous materials that we use in our manufacturing and research activities 
the levy of a substantial fine or penalty  the payment of significant environmental remediation costs or the loss of a permit or other authorization to operate or engage in our ordinary course of business could materially adversely affect our business 
we could be exposed to material product liability claims that could prevent or interfere with the commercialization of any other products that we may develop 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
liability exposures for biopharmaceuticals  such as erbitux  could prevent or interfere with continued sales of erbitux or the commercialization of any other products that we may develop 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
we currently have million of aggregate product liability insurance coverage 
our business may be materially and adversely affected by a successful product liability claim or claims in excess of or outside our insurance coverage 
risks relating to our common stock certain provisions of delaware law  our charter and bylaws and our stockholder rights plan could hinder  delay or prevent changes in control 
certain provisions of delaware law  our charter and our bylaws  as well as our stockholder rights plan have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing transactions that involve an actual or threatened change in control 
these provisions include the following stockholder rights plan 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan on february  our stockholder rights plan may discourage any potential acquirer from acquiring more than of our outstanding common stock since  upon this type of acquisition without approval of our board of directors  all other common stockholders will have the right to purchase a specified amount of our common stock at a substantial discount from market price  thus significantly increasing the acquisition cost to a potential acquirer 
special meetings 
according to our bylaws  special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors 
removal of directors 
subject to the rights of bms to elect at least one director  our bylaws provide that a director can be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast 
advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations and proposals 
our bylaws require advance written notice for stockholders to nominate persons for election as directors at  or to bring other business before  any meeting of stockholders 
this bylaw provision limits the ability of stockholders to make nominations of persons for election as directors or to introduce other proposals unless we are notified in a timely manner prior to the meeting 
preferred stock 
under our charter  our board of directors has authority to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms  preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock  all without approval of our stockholders 
delaware business combinations 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  restricts certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and a stockholder owning or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes a stockholder 
in addition to discouraging a third party from acquiring control of us  the foregoing provisions could impair the ability of existing stockholders to remove and replace our management and or our board of directors 
our stock price is highly volatile 
it may be difficult for you to resell our common stock 
over the past two years our common stock price has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
in addition  the following factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development or being commercialized by us or our competitors  developments or outcomes of investigations and litigation generally  including litigation relating to proprietary rights and patents  regulatory developments or delays concerning our products in the united states and foreign countries  issues concerning the safety of our products or of biotechnology products generally  economic and other external factors or a disaster or crisis  and period to period fluctuations in our financial results

as previously disclosed  the company is developing a fully human monoclonal antibody  referred to as imc f  which it intends to commercialize outside the united states and canada 
the company believes it has the right to do so under its existing development and license agreement with merck kgaa 
however  merck kgaa has advised the company that it believes that imc f is covered under the development and license agreement with merck kgaa and that it could therefore have the exclusive rights to market imc f outside the united states and canada and co exclusive development rights in japan  for which it would pay the same royalty as it pays for erbitux

our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and under risk factors set forth in item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview imclone systems is a biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to advance oncology care by developing and commercializing a portfolio of targeted treatments designed to address the medical needs of patients with cancer 
our lead product  erbitux is a first of its kind antibody approved by the fda for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
erbitux binds specifically to epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  her  c erbb on both normal and tumor cells  and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor egf and other ligands  such as transforming growth factor alpha 
we are conducting  and in some cases have completed  clinical studies evaluating erbitux for broader use in colorectal cancer  for the potential treatment of head and neck  lung and pancreatic cancers  as well as other potential indications 
on february   the fda approved erbitux for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
in september  health canada approved the use of erbitux for use in combination with irinotecan for the treatment of egfr expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma in patients who are refractory to other irinotecan based chemotherapy regimens and for use as a single agent for the treatment of egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal carcinoma in patients who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
on march   the fda approved erbitux for use in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of locally or regionally advanced scchn and as a single agent in recurrent or metastatic scchn where prior platinum based chemotherapy has failed 
please see full prescribing information  available at www 
erbitux 
com  for important safety information relating to erbitux  including boxed warnings 
on december   swissmedic  the swiss agency for therapeutic products  approved erbitux in switzerland for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer who no longer respond to standard chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan 
merck kgaa licensed the right to market erbitux outside the united states and canada from the company in in japan  merck kgaa has marketing rights to erbitux  which are co exclusive to the co development rights of the company and bms 
on june   merck kgaa received marketing approval by the european commission to sell erbitux for use in combination with irinotecan for the treatment of patients with egfr expressing metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of irinotecan including cytotoxic therapy 
on december   swissmedic approved erbitux in switzerland in combination with radiation in the treatment of patients with previously untreated  advanced scchn 
our revenues  as well as our results of operations  have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period due to several factors  including but not limited to the amount and timing of revenues earned from commercial sales of erbitux  the effect in of full absorption cost of goods sold on sales of erbitux to our corporate partners  the timing of recognition of license fees and milestone revenues  the status of development of our various product candidates  whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones  fluctuations in our effective tax rate and timing on when we may revise our conclusions regarding the realization of our net deferred tax assets  which currently have a full valuation allowance  legal costs and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and investigations  and the addition or termination of research programs or funding support and variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary product candidates during any given period 
as a result of our substantial investment in research and development  we have incurred significant operating losses and have an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we anticipate that our accumulated deficit may continue to decrease in the future as we earn revenues on commercial sales of erbitux and generate net income 
although prior to we had devoted most of our efforts and resources to research and development  consistent with  we expect that we will continue to devote greater efforts and resources to the manufacturing  marketing  and commercialization of erbitux 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully manufacture  market or commercialize erbitux or that potential customers will buy erbitux 
we rely entirely on third party manufacturers for filling and finishing services with respect to erbitux 
if our current third party manufacturers or critical raw material suppliers fail to meet our expectations  we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into new agreements with other suppliers or third party manufacturers without an adverse effect on our business 
highlights and outlook on january   we announced that the board of directors had engaged the investment bank lazard to conduct  in conjunction with management  a full review of the company s strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value 
these alternatives could include a merger  sale or strategic alliance 
the company is proceeding in consultation with its existing partners as the process moves forward 
the decision to undertake this process follows a review of the company s business  products  assets and current strategic position 
we believe that we are in a strong financial position  we have a commercial product in erbitux with over million in domestic in market sales last year each successive quarter seeing notable sales increases 
in  we expect to launch erbitux in a second tumor type and we hope to see mature survival data in a variety of settings that could give this compound a significant advantage over potential competition 
we also have a pipeline that includes a number of clinical stage therapeutics aimed at some of the more interesting targets in oncology today 
we believe that these compounds have the potential to make tremendous progress over the next two years  some reaching phase iii testing in a variety of indications 
in addition to our clinical pipeline  we are developing a host of mid and late stage pre clinical compounds that will begin to enter the clinic over this same time frame 
given the foregoing  and in addition to our strong financial position  manufacturing capabilities  development and commercialization capabilities  we believe that imclone has evolved successfully over the past few years 
but for us to realize the full value of erbitux  our pipeline and other assets  in an increasingly competitive market  we believe that scale is a critical factor 
our current size combined with the time and resources required to realize commercial benefit from our existing pipeline may limit our ability to achieve our full potential 
for this reason  we feel that it is now appropriate to initiate a process of exploring ways to enhance shareholder value and unlock the potential of our assets 
while it is our intention to execute an appropriate transaction  we cannot make assurances that any particular alternative will be pursued or that a transaction will occur 
to that end  we will continue to operate as a company in the ordinary course  and we will continue a program of robust investment in the future of our products 
because we believe our human capital our employees are an important asset in any eventuality  it is our goal to continue to provide for their development as the company moves forward 
in  we continued to build and provide for the future development of our erbitux franchise by continuing our clinical investment in a variety of indications  by filing an sbla to seek approval for use in head and neck cancer  and by enhancing commercial efforts to broaden patient access 
from a financing perspective  we announced the approval of a share repurchase plan permitting the repurchase of our common stock up to a total aggregate amount of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased  shares at an average price of per share for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
on december   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of unvested stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share outstanding as of december  that had been previously awarded to company employees and other eligible participants  including officers and non employee directors 
options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were subject to this acceleration 
as a condition  we required each non employee director and each officer of the company  to agree to refrain from selling  transferring  pledging or otherwise disposing of shares of common stock acquired upon any exercise of subject stock options until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the stock option s pre acceleration vesting terms or pursuant to the company s change in control plan or  if earlier  the officer s last day of employment with  or director s last day of service as a director of  the company 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these stock options  which were out of the money was made primarily to minimize future compensation expense that we would otherwise have been required to recognize pursuant to fasr  which we have adopted effective january  we estimate that the aggregate future expense that will be eliminated as a result of this acceleration of vesting is approximately million in and million in in  we are continuing to execute a program of focused investments designed to sustain our competitive position in the short term and ensure that we are adequately positioned for sustainable  longer term growth 
our financial expectations and plans for the year reflect these objectives 
the following guidance has been provided on our expected results for the year royalty revenue in will continue to reflect of bms s net sales and a range of of merck kgaa net sales 
license fees and milestone revenue in will include the continuing amortization  based on clinical development spending  of the million received thus far from bms and the final milestone of million from bms as a result of the approval of the head and neck sbla 
at the anticipated rates of clinical spending for  amortization of milestones for the full year  assuming the receipt of the additional million  should approximate million  including a catch up effect of receipt of this final milestone of approximately million 
manufacturing revenue in will continue to reflect erbitux shipped to our partners for commercial use  although no such product was shipped to merck kgaa in the price charged for commercial material is based on our actual cost to manufacture the product  plus  in the case of bms only  a mark up on bulk manufacturing costs 
the selling price to our partners in is estimated to be comparable to the price charged in collaborative agreement revenue in will continue to include the purchase of erbitux for clinical use by our partners  reimbursement by our corporate partners of certain regulatory  clinical and marketing expenses incurred on behalf of erbitux  and reimbursement of royalty expenses of of domestic net sales in accordance with the existing terms of the bms agreement  as well as a low single digit amount from merck kgaa 
effective january   we have adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which provides that the expense associated with share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
based on the implementation of this statement  we estimate that the total expense for stock options in will be approximately million 
such expense will be reflected in each expense category where the employee benefits are categorized 
research and development expenses include costs to support our pre clinical research efforts as well as development costs including process scale up  toxicology and production of non erbitux clinical materials for our pipeline 
these costs are expected to approximate million in  including approximately million attributable to stock option expense 
the increase from reflects additional efforts in support of our non erbitux pipeline  including third party manufacturing costs  costs associated with producing clinical supplies of erbitux for use by us and our partners which are reimbursed as a component of collaborative agreement revenue  and expansion of basic research activities 
clinical and regulatory expenses in are expected to increase significantly as we embark on a number of studies in support of expanded use of erbitux as well as later stage clinical development programs for four pipeline products 
in addition  we are enhancing our medical affairs programs  and expanding our regulatory capabilities 
as a result  total clinical and regulatory expenses are expected to reach approximately million in  including approximately million attributable to stock option expense 
of course  a contractually determined portion of the erbitux related expenses will continue to be reimbursed as a component of collaborative agreement revenue 
marketing  general and administrative expenses should approximate million in  including approximately million attributable to stock option expense 
the increase versus is principally attributable to increased marketing efforts in support of the potential head and neck indication for erbitux 
royalty expenses in will continue to include of north american net sales through the first quarter  with of us net sales expected to be reimbursed as a component of collaborative agreement revenue  resulting in a net royalty burden to us of 
in subsequent quarters  the gross royalty expense of domestic net sales is expected to decline to  resulting in a net royalty burden of 
in addition  a single digit percentage of international net sales will also be incurred 
based on our current expectations of purchases by our partners  we expect to begin to reflect full cost of manufacturing revenue in with respect to the tax rate for  we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately  which does not include the effect of any potential release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates are deemed critical when a different methodology could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate from period to period may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies that require management to make significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are set forth below 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure below have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition our revenues are derived from four primary sources license fees and milestone payments  manufacturing revenue  royalty revenue  and collaborative agreement revenue 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments primarily consist of up front license fees and milestone payments received under the commercial agreement with bms  relating to erbitux  and milestone payments received under the development and license agreement with merck kgaa 
we recognize all non refundable up front license fees as revenues in accordance with the guidance provided in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
our most critical application of this policy  to date  relates to the  in license fees received from bms under the commercial agreement which are being deferred and recognized as revenue based upon the actual product research and development costs incurred since september  to date by bms and imclone as a percentage of the estimated total of such costs to be incurred over the year term of the commercial agreement 
the estimated total of such costs is based on the clinical development budget which establishes joint responsibilities that will be carried out by both the company and bms for certain clinical and other studies 
of the  in payments received through december    was recognized as revenue in and  from the commencement of the commercial agreement in through december  the methodology used to recognize deferred revenue involves a number of estimates and judgments  such as the estimate of total product research and development costs to be incurred under the commercial agreement 
changes in these estimates and judgments can have a significant effect on the size and timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  if management had chosen a different methodology to recognize the license fee and milestone payments received under the commercial agreement  the company s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
for example  if the company were to recognize the revenues earned from the commercial agreement on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement  the company would have recognized approximately  and  as revenue for and from the commencement of the commercial agreement  respectively  through december  management believes that the current methodology used to recognize revenues under the commercial agreement  which reflects the level of effort consistent with the product development activities  is the most appropriate methodology because it reflects the level of expenditure and activity in the period in which it is being spent as compared to the total expected expenditure over the life of the commercial agreement 
this cost to cost approach is systematic and rational  it provides a factually supportable pattern to track progress  and is reflective of the level of effort  which varies over time 
non refundable upfront payments received from merck kgaa were deferred due to our significant continuing involvement and are being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated service period because the activities specified in the agreement between the company and merck kgaa will be performed over the estimated service period and there is no other pattern or circumstances that indicate a different way in which the revenue is earned 
in addition  the development and license agreement with merck kgaa does not contain any provisions for establishing a clinical budget and none has been established between the parties 
this agreement does not call for co development with the company in merck kgaa s territory  rather merck kgaa is solely responsible for regulatory efforts in its territory 
non refundable milestone payments  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  pursuant to collaborative agreements other than the commercial agreement  are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone 
this is because each milestone payment represents the achievement of a substantive step in the research and development process and merck kgaa has the right to evaluate the technology to decide whether to continue with the research and development program as each milestone is reached 
manufacturing revenue consists of revenue earned on the sale of erbitux to our corporate partners for subsequent commercial sale 
the company recognizes manufacturing revenue when the product is shipped  which is when our partners take ownership and title has passed  collectibility is reasonably assured  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we are contractually obligated to sell erbitux to bms at our cost of production plus a markup on bulk 
we sell bulk inventory to merck kgaa at our full absorption cost of production 
the continuing level of manufacturing revenue in future periods may fluctuate significantly based on market demand  our cost of production  as well as bms s required level of safety stock inventory for erbitux and whether merck kgaa orders erbitux for commercial use 
royalty revenues from licensees  which are based on third party sales of licensed products and technology  are recorded as earned in accordance with contract terms when third party sales can be reliably measured and collection of funds is reasonably assured 
collaborative agreement revenue consists of reimbursements received from bms and merck kgaa related to clinical and regulatory studies  erbitux provided to them for use in clinical studies  reimbursement of a portion of royalty expense and certain marketing and administrative costs 
collaborative agreement revenue is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements under the respective contracts 
withholding taxes in january  new york state notified the company that it was liable for the new york state and city income taxes that were not withheld because one or more of the company s employees who exercised certain non qualified stock options in and failed to pay new york state and city income taxes for those years 
on march   the company entered into a closing agreement with new york state  paying  to settle the matter 
subsequently  the company became aware of another potential income and employment tax withholding liability associated with the exercise of certain warrants granted in the early years of the company s existence that were held by certain former officers  directors and employees 
after the company informed new york state of the issue relating to the warrants  new york state  in june  notified the company that it was continuing the previously conducted audit of the company and was evaluating the terms of the closing agreement to determine whether or not it should be re opened 
on march   the company entered into a new closing agreement pursuant to which the company paid new york state an additional  in full satisfaction of all the deficiencies and determinations of withholding taxes for the years as a result  we utilized  of the liability of  that we previously established for new york withholding taxes on stock options and warrants exercised and recognized a benefit of  as a recovery in the consolidated statements of operations in on march   the company initiated discussions with the internal revenue service the irs relating to the federal income taxes applicable to the above noted issues 
on february   the company received a draft of the irs s report of its preliminary findings which indicated that the irs  in addition to imposing liability on the company for taxes not withheld  intended to assert penalties with respect to both the failure to withhold on non qualified stock options and the failure to report and withhold on the warrants described above 
on march   the company reached an agreement in principle with the irs to resolve the employment tax audit  which includes the company s agreement to the imposition of an accuracy related penalty under section of the internal revenue code 
under this agreement  the company expects to pay approximately  to the irs 
the company had previously recorded a withholding tax liability of  and a withholding tax asset of  in its consolidated balance sheet as of december  based on the agreement in principle reached with the irs  the company has eliminated the withholding tax asset of  and has recorded an additional withholding tax liability of  or a total of  in its consolidated balance sheet as of december  as a result  the company has recorded in the fourth quarter of a net withholding tax expense of  inventories until february   all costs associated with the manufacturing of erbitux were included in research and development expenses when incurred 
effective february   the date after the company received approval from the fda for erbitux  we began to capitalize in inventory the cost of manufacturing erbitux and will expense such costs as cost of manufacturing revenue at the time of sale 
since we had previously expensed all inventory produced  the costs of manufacturing revenue in reflected minimal costs that primarily consisted of shipping and storage charges 
in  we continued to sell inventory that was previously expensed as well as inventory that was partially expensed  since there was inventory in process on the date that we received fda approval of erbitux 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold substantially all inventory with partial costs and in  our cost of manufacturing revenue will reflect full absorption costs of production 
as previously mentioned  we are obligated to sell erbitux to bms at our costs of production plus a mark up on bulk and to merck kgaa at our cost of production 
we expect that our quarterly margins on sales of erbitux will begin to stabilize in and reflect an average margin of approximately 
our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products when  based on management s judgment  future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in fasb concepts statement no 
if applicable  we assess the regulatory and approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval 
we also consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval 
we review our inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
litigation the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we have not established a legal reserve in our financial statements because we do not believe that such a reserve is required to be established at this time  in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
however  if in a future period  events in any such legal proceedings render it probable that a loss will be incurred  and if such loss is reasonably estimable at that time  we will establish such a reserve 
thus  it is possible that legal proceedings may have a material adverse impact on the operating results for that period  on our balance sheet or both 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 
assets are considered to be impaired and written down to fair value if expected associated undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying amounts 
fair value is generally determined as the present value of the expected associated cash flows 
as noted under item properties  we own a number of buildings that are primarily dedicated to the manufacturing of erbitux and other clinical products in our pipeline 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 
changes in regulatory or other business conditions in the future could change our judgments about the carrying value of these facilities  which could result in the recognition of material impairment losses 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
as of december   the company continues to reflect a valuation allowance against its total net deferred tax assets because  more likely than not  its net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
although management believes that the valuation allowance as of december  is appropriate  we expect that as we continue to sell erbitux to our corporate partners for commercial use and earn royalties and income from operations from the expected commercial sales of erbitux  we will need to revise our conclusions regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets due to expected changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
in addition  there may be other factors such as changes in tax laws and future levels of research and development spending that may impact our effective tax rate in the future

there are certain categories for which we receive reimbursement from our partners clinical and regulatory expenses  the cost of erbitux supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies  certain marketing and administrative expenses  and a portion of royalty expense 
during  we earned  in collaborative agreement revenue  of which approximately  represents amounts earned from bms and approximately  represents amounts earned from merck kgaa  as compared to  earned in the comparable period in  of which  was earned from bms and approximately  was earned from merck kgaa 
the increase in collaborative agreement revenue of million is principally due to an increase in reimbursement for clinical drugs of approximately million and an increase in royalty expense reimbursement of approximately million  partly offset by minor decreases in the reimbursement of certain marketing  general and administrative expenses 
collaborative agreement revenue in will continue to include the purchase of erbitux for clinical use by our partners  reimbursement by our corporate partners of certain regulatory  clinical and marketing expenses incurred on behalf of erbitux  and for royalty expense of of north american net sales in accordance with the existing terms of the bms agreement and a low single digit amount from merck kgaa

as previously mentioned  we are obligated to sell erbitux to bms at our costs of production plus a mark up on bulk and to merck kgaa at our cost of production 
we expect that our quarterly margins on sales of erbitux will begin to stabilize in and reflect an average margin of approximately 
discontinuation of small molecule program on may   we announced a plan to discontinue our small molecule research program 
this decision was made after evaluating our investment in such program against the time horizon before commercial benefits would be realized 
as a result of this decision  we recorded in the second quarter of approximately  of costs associated with the discontinuation of this program 
such costs include approximately  of costs related to severance for employees that were terminated  approximately  of costs related to the write off of fixed assets used in such program and approximately  of contract termination costs related to the cancellation of the lease at the brooklyn facility where the employees were conducting such research and approximately  of other shutdown expenses 
the disposition of this program is substantially complete and the majority of the termination benefits was paid as of december  witholding tax expense recovery the increase of  is due to the fact that  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net withholding tax expense of  as a result of reaching an agreement in principle with the irs to resolve a pending withholding tax matter 
the agreement in principle reached with the irs provides for the imposition of an accuracy related penalty under section of the internal revenue code  which increased the estimated withholding tax liability from million as previously recorded in our balance sheet as of december  to a total of approximately million 
in  we recorded a recovery of withholding tax of  because we reversed a liability that was settled at an amount less than originally estimated 
interest income and interest expense interest income in amounted to  an increase of  or from the comparable period in this increase is attributable to increases in interest rates from the comparable period in as well as a higher average cash and securities balance during as compared with  as a result of receiving  from the issuance of convertible debt in may and receiving million from bms in march of interest expense in amounted to  a decrease of  or from the decrease is due to lower interest rate than in the comparable period of  partly offset by an increase in debt outstanding 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  amounted to approximately 
the effective tax rate for includes an adjustment of approximately  resulting from the reconciliation of the tax provision to our filed tax returns 
the primary reason for the increase in the effective rate from the rate previously estimated is due to the impact of a withholding tax expense of  recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of reaching a tentative agreement with the irs to resolve an employment tax matter that had been outstanding since the difference from the statutory rate of is due to the utilization of fully reserved deferred tax assets  primarily the amortization of deferred revenue associated with license fees and milestones  which were taxable in prior periods 
a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately  which does not include the effect of any potential release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
net income we had net income of  or per basic common share and per diluted common share for the year ended december   compared with net income of  or per basic common share and per diluted common share for the year ended december  the fluctuation in results was due to the factors noted above

of  the increase of  in license fees and milestone revenue from the comparable period in is due to an increase in revenue recognized under the commercial agreement with bms primarily as a result of the  received in the first quarter of  when we obtained fda approval of erbitux and due to increases in clinical development spending by bms and imclone 
manufacturing revenue manufacturing revenue of  in consists of sales of erbitux to our corporate partners for commercial use 
in accordance with the commercial agreement  we are contractually obligated to sell erbitux to bms at our cost of production plus a markup on bulk 
we sell bulk inventory to merck kgaa at our full absorption cost of production 
there were no sales of erbitux to merck kgaa during the selling price for erbitux to our corporate partners is based on the full absorption costs of production incurred  which during reflected the weighted average costs of production for inventory previously produced by lonza and at our bb manufacturing plant 
during  we sold all inventory produced by lonza 
royalty revenue royalty revenue consists primarily of royalty payments earned on the sale of erbitux by our partners  bms and merck kgaa 
under our agreement with bms  we are entitled to royalty payments equal to of bms s net sales of erbitux in the united states and canada 
under our agreement with merck kgaa  we are entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of gross margin of merck kgaa s sales of erbitux outside the united states and canada 
during  we earned royalties from bms of  on net sales of erbitux of approximately million and royalties from merck kgaa of  on net sales of erbitux of approximately million 
collaborative agreement revenue collaborative agreement revenue consists primarily of reimbursements from our partners bms and merck kgaa under our collaborative agreements 
there are certain categories for which we receive reimbursement from our partners clinical and regulatory expenses  the cost of erbitux supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies  certain marketing and administrative expenses and a portion of royalty expense 
during  we earned  in collaborative agreement revenue of which  represents amounts earned from bms and  represents amounts earned from merck kgaa  as compared to  earned in the comparable period in  of which  was earned from bms and  was earned from merck kgaa 
the increase in collaborative agreement revenue of  in is principally due to royalty expense reimbursed by our corporate partners of approximately  and an increase in drug shipments to our partners of approximately  partly offset by a decrease in clinical and regulatory reimbursement 
research and development research and development expenses in and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses include costs associated with our in house and collaborative research programs  product and process development expenses  costs to manufacture erbitux until february  and other product candidates prior to any approval that we may obtain of a product candidate for commercial sale and quality assurance and quality control costs 
research and development include costs that are reimbursable from our corporate partners 
approximately  and  of costs representing research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  were reimbursed and included under collaborative agreement revenue since they represent inventory supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies

in order to increase our presence and prominence within the oncology community and to help maximize the market potential for erbitux in its approved indications  we established a sales force of oncology sales professionals during the fourth quarter of cost of manufacturing revenue effective february   the company began to capitalize in inventory the costs of manufacturing of erbitux for commercial sale and will expense such costs as cost of manufacturing revenue at the time of sale 
however  as we have been selling our existing inventory that was previously expensed  there has been a period of time in which the company reflected minimum cost of manufacturing revenue since the majority of the cost of such inventory was expensed in prior periods as research and development expenses 
cost of manufacturing revenue for of approximately million reflects primarily fill and finish costs 
royalty expense royalty expense of  for the year ended december  consists of obligations related to certain licensing agreements related to erbitux 
approximately  of royalty expense is reimbursed by our corporate partners and included as collaborative agreement revenue for the year ended december  in january  we finalized and signed license agreements with genentech and centocor  inc for the rights to patents covering various aspects of antibody technology and certain use of epidermal growth factor receptor egfr antibodies 
for erbitux use in combination with anti neoplastic agents  imclone systems gross royalty expense for all licenses  including genentech  centocor  aventis and the university of california  is approximately of north american sales 
we receive reimbursements for a portion of these royalty expenses  resulting in a net royalty expense of approximately 
after the first quarter of  gross royalty expense will decrease to and net royalty expense will decrease to 
for erbitux monotherapy use  gross and net royalty expenses will be reduced by approximately because certain licenses are not applicable 
fourth quarter royalty expenses include charges of approximately million required to bring estimated royalty expenses recorded through the first nine months of in line with actual obligations 
litigation settlement in january  a number of complaints asserting claims under the federal securities laws against the company and certain of the company s directors and officers were filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
those actions were consolidated under the caption irvine v 
imclone systems incorporated 
the complaint generally alleged that various public statements made by or on behalf of the company or the other defendants during and early regarding the prospects for fda approval of erbitux were false or misleading when made  that the individual defendants were allegedly aware of material non public information regarding the actual prospects for erbitux at the time that they engaged in transactions in the company s common stock and that members of the purported stockholder class suffered damages when the market price of the company s common stock declined following disclosure of the information that allegedly had not been previously disclosed 
on january   and continuing thereafter  nine separate purported shareholder derivative actions were filed against members of the company s board of directors  certain of the company s present and former officers  and the company  as nominal defendant  advancing claims based on allegations similar to the allegations in the federal securities class action complaints 
on january   we reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated class action described above for a cash payment of million  a portion of which will be paid by our insurers 
the settlement is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive settlement documents and to court approval 
the company anticipates that a hearing to consider approval of the settlement will be held in late april or early may we also reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated derivative action described above 
under the settlement  the company will be paid million by its insurers  which the company intends to contribute toward the settlement of the irvine securities class action described above after deducting amounts awarded by the court in the derivative action for plaintiffs attorney s fees and expenses in that action  which the company has agreed not to oppose in an amount up to  the proposed settlement is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive settlement documents  the approval and consummation of the settlement of the irvine class action and court approval 
as a result  we have recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at december  as litigation settlement  a liability of million and a receivable from our insurers of approximately million  included in other current assets 
net expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as litigation settlement 
witholding tax expense recovery the amount for the year december  of  consists of the reversal of a liability related to withholding taxes that was settled at an amount less than was originally estimated 
the recovery in the comparable period of of  is due to a recovery of a previous write down related to a withholding tax matter attributable to a former executive of the company 
interest income and interest expense interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with  in the comparable period in  an increase of  this increase is attributable to the increase in the company s cash and cash equivalents and our securities portfolio primarily as a result of the receipt of  in march of and the  of convertible debt issued in may interest expense was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the fact that the company s cost of borrowing decreased with the issuance of million of convertible debt in may of  compared to the million of convertible debt outstanding in the comparable period of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  amounted to approximately which is lower than the amount previously indicated in our third quarter filing 
the primary reason for the decline in the effective rate is due to the fact that the company was able to utilize approximately million of net operating losses that were previously believed to be limited based on a previous analysis conducted under section of the internal revenue code of during the fourth quarter of  we hired an external firm to conduct a study under section in order to verify if we had any limitations under this section of the code 
based on the results of such study  we learned that we do not have a limitation under section  as previously believed 
therefore  we have utilized all available net operating losses in which has resulted in a lower actual effective rate than previously calculated in the third quarter of the effective tax rate in was also impacted by a million litigation settlement expense taken in the fourth quarter of the difference from the statutory rate of is due to the utilization of net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards and state taxes 
a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income loss we had net income of  or per basic common share and per diluted common share for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or per basic and diluted common share in the comparable period in the fluctuation in results was due to the factors noted above 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale of approximately million 
historically  we have financed our operations through a variety of sources  most significantly through the issuance of public and private equity and convertible notes  license fees and milestone payments and reimbursements from our corporate partners 
since the approval of erbitux on february   we began to generate royalty revenue and manufacturing revenue from the commercial sale of erbitux by our corporate partners and generated income from operations in and as we continue to generate income  our cash flows from operating activities are expected to increase as a source to fund our operations 
therefore  we anticipate that our future financial condition and our future operating performance will continue to experience significant changes and that past performance will not likely be indicative of our future performance 
summary of cash flows years ended december  variance vs 
vs 
thousands of dollars cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents historically our cash flows from operating activities have fluctuated significantly due to the nature of our operations and the timing of our cash receipts 
during the year ended december   we used approximately million in cash for operating activities  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities in of million 
the fluctuation in operating cash flows is due to the fact that in we paid million in net litigation expense related to the securities class action settled in january  and approximately million of royalty payments to genentech and centocor related to for license agreements that we finalized during january these uses of cash from operations were partially offset by cash generated from operations due to increased royalty income in as a result of higher in market net sales of erbitux by our partners bms and merck kgaa 
in  we generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately million  mainly due to receipt of a milestone payment of million from bms as a result of the fda s approval of erbitux in the first quarter of as we continue to earn revenues and operating income from the sale of erbitux  we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to experience significant fluctuations from prior period results 
our primary sources and uses of cash under investing activities consist of purchases and sales activity in our investment portfolio  which we manage based on our liquidity needs  possible business development transactions and amounts used for capital expenditures 
during the year ended december   we used net cash from investing activities of million comprised of approximately million in acquisition of fixed assets  primarily related to the construction of our bb manufacturing facility  offset by net proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities in our investment portfolio of million 
in  we used million from investing activities mainly due to the fact that in we had net purchases of approximately million in investment securities for our portfolio  which we classified as securities available for sale and we spent approximately million on fixed assets  primarily related to the construction of our bb manufacturing facility 
the cash used in for investing purposes was generated from the issuance of the million of senior convertible notes in the second quarter of and from the million milestone payment received from bms in march net cash flows used in financing activities in amounted to million due to the purchase of  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for aggregate consideration of approximately million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees of approximately million 
in  we generated approximately million in net cash from cash financing activities primarily as a result of the issuance of the million in senior convertible notes and also as a result of proceeds of million from employees exercise of stock options 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and our cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to support our operations at least through the first quarter of we are also entitled to reimbursement for certain marketing  royalty expense  and research and development expenditures and certain other payments  some of which are payable contingent upon the achievement of research and development and regulatory milestones 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve these milestones 
our future working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to progress and cost of our research and development programs  pre clinical testing and clinical studies  the amount and timing of revenues earned from the commercial sale of erbitux  our corporate partners fulfilling their obligations to us  timing and cost of seeking and obtaining additional regulatory approvals  level of resources that we devote to the development of marketing and field operations capabilities  costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  and legal costs associated with the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and investigations  status of competition  and our ability to maintain existing corporate collaborations and establish new collaborative arrangements with other companies to provide funding to support these activities

interest on the securities is adjusted monthly  quarterly or semi annually  depending on the instrument  using prevailing interest rates 
these holdings are highly liquid and we consider the potential for loss of principal to be minimal 
our outstanding fixed rate convertible senior notes in the principal amount of  due may  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment and to certain restrictions as outlined in the indenture agreement 
the fair value of fixed interest rate instruments is affected by changes in interest rates and in the case of the convertible notes by changes in the price of our common stock as well 
the fair value of the convertible senior notes was approximately  at december
