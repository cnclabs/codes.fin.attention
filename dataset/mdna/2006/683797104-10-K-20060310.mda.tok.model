item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the company engages in a broad range of activities in the securities industry  including retail securities brokerage  institutional sales and trading  investment banking both corporate and public finance  research  market making  and investment advisory and asset management services 
the company provides its services from offices in states located throughout the united states 
the company conducts business in offices in latin america through local broker dealers 
client assets entrusted to the company as at december  totaled approximately billion 
the company provides investment advisory services through oam and oppenheimer s fahnestock asset management and omega group divisions 
the company provides trust services and products through oppenheimer trust company 
the company provides discount brokerage services through freedom and through buyandhold  a division of freedom 
at december   client assets under management by the asset management groups totaled billion 
at december   the company employed approximately  people full time  of whom approximately  were financial advisors 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized in note to those statements 
certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the company s financial results because they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
these include cash equivalents  deposits with brokers and clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
the company s remaining financial instruments are generally short term in nature  and their carrying values approximate fair value  with the exception of the company s variable rate exchangeable debentures  which are carried at cost 
investments  included in securities owned  which have a ready market are valued using quoted market or dealer prices 
investments with no ready market value are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by management 
generally  management will initially value investments at cost 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include available market prices  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results of the issuer  and other pertinent information 
management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of these investments 
there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique 
the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of an amount that the company could realize in a current transaction 
because of inherent uncertainty of valuation  these estimated fair values do not necessarily represent amounts that might be ultimately realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances and the differences could be material 
intangible assets and goodwill goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  provides that goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of identifiable intangible assets must be amortized over their useful lives  unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
goodwill relates to the acquisitions of oppenheimer  first of michigan capital corporation  grand charter group incorporated  josephthal co 
inc and the oppenheimer divisions and has been allocated to the private client reporting unit pursuant to sfas no 
the company obtained an independent valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with respect to the acquisition of the oppenheimer division in this valuation involved significant estimates  which were based on historical data  revenue projections and industry experience 
the company has identified intangible assets relating to customer relationships  which it is amortizing over their useful lives  and trademarks and trade names  which are being evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis 
t he excess cost of the oppenheimer division is being allocated to goodwill 
the company reviews its goodwill on at least an annual basis in order to determine whether its value is impaired 
as a result of the company s share price trading below book value during the latter part of  the company engaged an independent investment bank to test the value of the company 
based on that report and the judgment of management  the company has determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  the company uses valuation techniques based on multiples of revenues  earnings  book value and discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
if the value of the goodwill is impair ed  the difference between the value of the goodwill reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal and regulatory proceedings in accounts payable and other liabilities 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing  if any  on the part of an employee of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law as well as the timing of the resolution of such matters 
each legal and regulatory proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded as a charge to results in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal or regulatory proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount 
the company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from clients and financial consultants 
client loans are collateralized by securities  however  if there is a decline in the value of the collateral and the company cannot obtain additional collateral or collect on the loan  a reserve is established 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors as part of its hiring process 
reserves are established on these receivables if the financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and the receivable has not been promptly repaid or if it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
the company also estimates taxes payable and records income tax reserves 
these reserves are based on historic experience and may not reflect the ultimate liability 
the company monitors and adjusts these reserves as necessary 
asset management operations asset management fees are generally recognized over the period the related service is provided based on the account value at the valuation date in accordance with the respective asset management agreements 
in certain circumstances  the firm is entitled to receive incentive fees when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets 
incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a month period and are not subject to adjustment once the measurement period ends 
accordingly  incentive fees are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings when the measurement period ends 
asset management fees and incentive fees are included in advisory fees in the consolidated statements of earnings 
assets under management are not included as assets of the company 
business environment the securities industry is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including fluctuations in volume and price levels of securities and changes in interest rates  inflation  political events  investor participation levels  legal and regulatory  accounting  tax and compliance requirements and competition  all of which have an impact on commissions  firm trading  fees from accounts under investment management  and investment income as well as on liquidity 
substantial fluctuations can occur in revenues and net income due to these and other factors 
economic and market conditions continued to improve in the fourth quarter of investors remained focused on record high oil prices  indications of higher inflation  and rising short term interest rates 
expectations of increased corporate earnings led to increased equity market participation 
commission revenue improved in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous six quarters  although  in total  commissions for fiscal slightly lagged commissions in fiscal net interest revenue improved significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of higher interest rates and higher customer debit balances 
advisory fees in fiscal showed an increase compared to fiscal in line with improved market conditions and clients continuing adoption of fee based programs 
the company s expense burden in increased compared to the same period of due primarily to higher inter est costs  increased variable compensation costs relating to higher revenue levels  and an increase in the provision for legal and regulatory reserves 
the company has experienced a material increase in expenses relating to regulatory matters as it responds to the requirements of its various industry regulators  the sarbanes oxley act and the patriot act  as well as regulatory matters related to the company specifically  all of which have imposed significant costs including the establishment of additional reserves  as well as the expenditure of time and effort for the organization 
expenses of this type are anticipated to continue into the future  although not at the level experienced in interest rate changes impact the company s costs associated with carrying proprietary fixed income and equity inventories as well as its cost of borrowed funds 
interest rates were higher in fiscal compared to in fiscal investor interest in fixed income securities is driven by attractiveness of published rates  the direction of rates and economic expectations 
volatility in bond prices also impacts opportunities for profits in fixed income proprietary trading 
management constantly monitors its exposure to interest rate fluctuations to mitigate risk of loss in volatile environments 
regulatory environment the brokerage business is subject to regulation by the sec  the nyse  the nasd and various state securities regulators 
events in recent years surrounding corporate accounting and other activities leading to investor losses resulted in the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act and have caused increased regulation of public companies 
new regulations and new interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations are creating increased costs of compliance and increased investment in systems and procedures to comply with these more complex and onerous requirements 
increasingly  the various states are imposing their own regulations that make the uniformity of regulation a thing of the past  and make compliance more difficult and more expensive to monitor 
this regulatory environment has resulted in increased costs of compliance with rules and regulations  in particular  the impact of the rules and requirements that were created by the passage of the patriot act  and the anti money laundering regulations aml that are related thereto 
the expectation is that the increased costs of compliance in today s regulatory environment are not temporary 
the nasd rule and the nyse rule have instituted new rules relating to supervisory control processes 
these rules require that on march  the ceos of regulated broker dealers certify that their companies have processes to ensure that controls are in place so that policies and procedures conform to the requirements of applicable federal securities laws 
the company currently has no reason to believe that its ceo will not be able to make such certification 
mutual fund inquiry since the third quarter of  oppenheimer has been responding to the sec  the ny state attorney general  the nyse  the nasd and other regulators as part of an industry wide review of market timing  late trading and other activities involving mutual funds 
the company has answered several document requests and subpoenas and there have been on the record interviews of company personnel 
the inquiries have centered on oppenheimer s activities as a broker dealer and as a clearing firm 
the company has conducted its own investigation and is continuing to cooperate with the investigating entities 
the company believes that a few of its former financial advisors  working from a single branch office  engaged in activities that are the subject of the sec s inquiry largely during the period before the company acquired the us private client division of cibc world markets on january  the former employees and two persons  who had a supervisory role with respect to such financial advisors  who continue to be employed by the company  are also being investigated by and have received wells notices from the sec  the company has received no such notice 
there is no evidence that either the company or its employees were engaged in late trading 
the company has set aside reserves that it believes should address its financial exposure with respect to these matters 
the company continues to closely monitor its mutual fund activities and the activities of its employees 
other regulatory matters the company has been the subject of various regulatory investigations with respect to its operations up to and including most of these matters revolve around the period when the company was transferring the business and client accounts of various acquisitions it has made to a common systems platform between september and june during that period of time  the company absorbed approximately branch offices and  financial advisors  and transitioned more than  client accounts from four separate and distinct companies  each of which utilized a different technology platform 
the company s business doubled during this period 
as previously reported  certain of the company s operations were impacted beginning in june and the company experienced client service issues  which were subsequently corrected 
the new businesses undertaken by the company and the effect on the company  s operations for the period described above has resulted in investigations by the sec  the nyse  and the nasd 
with the exception of the mutual funds timing matter described above  the company has settled substantially all outstanding matters with the nyse 
on december   oppenheimer settled various regulatory matters including anti money laundering aml issues and nyse regulatory examination findings 
the settlements involved total fines of million  which was fully reserved in the company s results for the nine months ended september  as previously disclosed  these settled matters arose during a period of rapid expansion of the company 
as a result of this rapid growth  the company had not yet put in place all of the processes and procedures for the management of its larger business 
those processes have now been in place for an extended period of time 
the company s aml settlement with the nyse and the us treasury department fincen involved inadequate implementation of policies and procedures primarily in its two foreign branch offices  inadequate staffing and training in its aml area  and the filing of inadequate suspicious activity reports and did not involve allegations of money laundering or any other illegal or illicit activities by clients or employees of our firm 
further  none of the matters covered by the aml settlement resulted in any loss to clients 
oppenheimer also consented  without admitting or denying the allegations  to a censure and the imposition of a fine of  by the nasd with respect to the late filing of forms u and u during the period january through march on may  the nasd filed a complaint against oppenheimer for matters arising prior to with respect to the timeliness and accuracy of its municipal bond reporting  the adequacy of its email retention  the adequacy of its supervisory systems and procedures  as well as the timeliness of its response to certain nasd requests for information 
the company believes that it has made and continues to make every effort to cooperate with the nasd and all other regulators 
the company worked diligently to provide tens of thousands of documents and all requested information and will continue to work with the nasd toward a resolution of this matter 
on january   the nasd filed an action against oppenheimer and its chairman and ceo the complaint for alleged violations with respect to the company s filing of the nasd mutual fund breakpoint survey in this action could result in  among other things  monetary penalty  censure  suspension and or other remedial sanctions 
as previously disclosed  oppenheimer had previously informed the nasd of certain limitations within its system relative to selecting out and generating data in the form requested by the nasd  and the nasd had stated that no extensions to file would be granted to any firm 
as a result  just prior to the deadline  oppenheimer submitted the data it then had available 
the nasd informed oppenheimer within two days that its submission was deficient 
the company and mr 
lowenthal  the chairman and ceo  further maintain that the assignment of overall responsibility for the response to the survey was properly delegated by its ceo to individuals who had the requisite experience and background to complete and file the survey with the nasd 
the company and mr 
lowenthal believe that they have strong defenses for the disciplinary action brought against them because of these issues and intend to vigorously defend the action 
as the nasd itself notes  the issuance of a disciplinary complaint represents the initiation of a formal proceeding by the nasd in which the allegations have not been heard or determined and does not represent a decision as to any of the allegations contained in the complaint 
prior to the filing of the complaint  the company advised the nasd that it had reviewed the actual breakpoints applied for the period through  a period longer than required by nasd of similar member firms  and had returned to customers approximately  in breakpoint credits and had revised and enhanced its procedures for determining applicable breakpoints 
the company believes that the breakpoint survey matter was an industry wide problem and that the company has appropriately addressed in all respects the breakpoint issue with it clients 
the company and mr 
lowenthal are cooperating  have been cooperating and intend to continue to cooperate with all regulators and hope to reach a fair resolution of all outstanding regulatory issues 
the company has and continues to request an expedited adjudication of the matters in dispute 
as noted above  certain regulatory issues between the company and the nyse and nasd remain outstanding 
as part of its ongoing business  the company records reserves for legal expenses  judgments  fines and or awards attributable to litigation and regulatory matters 
in connection therewith  the company has increased its legal reserves for the fourth quarter of business continuity the company is committed to an on going investment in its technology and communications infrastructure including extensive business continuity planning and investment 
these costs are on going and the company believes that current and future costs will exceed historic levels due to business and regulatory requirements 
the company believes that internally generated funds from operations are sufficient to finance its expenditure program 
outlook the company s long term plan is to continue to expand existing offices by hiring experienced professionals as well as through the purchase of operating branch offices from other broker dealers  thus maximizing the potential of each office and the development of existing trading  investment banking  investment advisory and other activities 
equally important is the search for viable acquisition candidates 
as opportunities are presented  it is the long term intention of the company to pursue growth by acquisition where a comfortable match can be found in terms of corporate goals and personnel and at a price that would provide the company s shareholders with incremental value 
in the near term  the company will not be seeking additional significant acquisitions  but will continue to focus its attention on the management of its existing business 
in addition  the company is committed to improving its technology capabilities to support client service and the expansion of its capital markets capabilities 
results of operations the results of the year ended december   compared to the same period of  reflect improved market conditions in compared to as well as the impact of higher interest rates and higher customer balances 
the us economy has continued to pick up momentum as reflected in growth in fourth quarter gnp 
in the last half of  the equity markets experienced a rally that allowed most of the major indexes to close up for the year 
the following table sets forth the amount and percentage of the company s revenue from each principal source for each of the following years ended december in thousands of dollars  except percentages commissions principal transactions  net interest investment banking advisory fees arbitration awards other total revenue the company derives most of its revenue from the operations of its principal subsidiaries  oppenheimer and oam 
although maintained as separate entities  the operations of the company s brokerage subsidiaries are closely related because oppenheimer acts as clearing broker and omnibus clearing agent in transactions initiated by freedom 
except as expressly otherwise stated  the discussion below pertains to the operations of oppenheimer 
it is important to note when comparing the results of the year ended december   and  that the first quarter results were substantially impacted by non operating items resulting from a favorable arbitration award in the amount of  the following table and discussion summarizes the changes in the major revenue and expense categories for the past two years 
period to period change increase decrease in thousands of dollars versus versus amount percentage amount percentage revenue commissions principal transactions  net interest investment banking advisory fees arbitration awards other total revenue expenses compensation and related expenses clearing and exchanges fees communications and technology occupancy and equipment costs interest other total expenses profit before taxes income taxes net profit fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  other than interest commission income and  to a large extent  income from principal transactions depend on investor participation in the markets

advisory fees increased by for the year ended december  compared to fiscal assets under management by the asset management group were billion at december   unchanged from december   net of the december  expiration of the advisory contracts for the asia tigers fund and india fund 
these two advisory contracts represented approximately billion of assets managed at december  other revenue decreased by in the year ended december  compared to fiscal interest net interest revenue interest revenue less interest expense increased significantly in the year ended december  compared to fiscal as a result of higher interest rates in combined with higher customer debit balances

this expense is relatively fixed and is not influenced by increases or decreases in revenue levels 
the company s notes receivable balance peaked in july as a result of the acquisition of the oppenheimer divisions  resulting in higher amortization levels beginning in the third quarter of which are expected to continue through most of that said  due to attrition  the amortization expense in fiscal was approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal the cost of clearing and exch ange fees increased by in the year ended december  compared to fiscal the company finds itself processing a larger number of trades due to the general growth of its business and the fractionalization of executions as a result of changes in the equity markets  incurring higher overall clearing and exchange fees in fiscal compared to fiscal the cost of communications and technology decreased in the year ended december   compared to fiscal the level of investment in technology declined in the new contracts with vendors have reduced communications cost in fiscal compared to fiscal occupancy costs decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the company has continued to address its occupancy costs and has been successful in negotiating favorable leases resulting in reduced costs in fiscal compared to fiscal other expenses increased by for the year ended december  compared to fiscal included in other expenses in is approximately million of fee expense paid to third party money managers by oam million in  approximately million of solicitor fee expense paid to third parties by oppenheimer for introduced business million in  approximately million in regulatory settlement  litigation and legal costs million in  a credit of approximately thousand with respect to bad debt expense million credit in and a reduction in audit and accounting fees primarily due to the company s ability in to self administer its sarbanes oxley processes and procedures million in compared to million in 
the company continued to be affected by litigation and regulatory settlement costs in much of the company s unfavorable litigation experience in the past several years arose from its acquisitions of josephthal and prime charter in as stated above  the company has been affected by regulatory settlement expenses in which primarily arose from the period in after the conversion of customer accounts following the acquisition of the private client business of cibc world markets inc the company may incur additional such expenses in future quarters 
the company has used its best estimate to provide adequate reserves to cover potential litigation losses 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  other than interest commission income and  to a large extent  income from principal transactions depend on investor participation in the markets 
in the year ended december   commission revenue increased by compared to fiscal primarily as a result of overall investor activity in the markets

see item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company s principal business activities by their nature involve significant market  credit and other risks 
the company s effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability 
as part of its normal business operations  the company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market making capacity 
the company makes markets in over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers 
the company also makes markets in municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  government bonds and high yield bonds 
market risk 
market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
oppenheimer monitors market risks through daily profit and loss statements and position reports 
each trading department adheres to internal position limits determined by senior management and regularly reviews the age and composition of its proprietary accounts 
positions and profits and losses for each trading department are reported to senior management on a daily basis 
in its market making activities  oppenheimer must provide liquidity in the equities for which it makes markets 
as a result of this  oppenheimer has risk containment policies in place  which limit position size and monitor transactions on a minute to minute basis 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by the company fails to perform its contractual obligations 
the company follows industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
the company adjusts margin requirements if it believes the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
when oppenheimer advances funds or securities to a counterparty in a principal transaction or to a customer in a brokered transaction  it is subject to the risk that the counterparty or customer will not repay such advances 
if the market price of the securities purchased or loaned has declined or increased  respectively  oppenheimer may be unable to recover some or all of the value of the amount advanced 
a similar risk is also present where a customer is unable to respond to a margin call and the market price of the collateral has dropped 
in addition  oppenheimer s securities positions are subject to fluctuations in market value and liquidity 
in addition to monitoring the credit worthiness of its customers  oppenheimer imposes more conservative margin requirements than those of the nyse 
generally  oppenheimer limits customer loans to an amount not greater than of the value of the securities or if the securities in the account are concentrated in a limited number of issues 
particular attention and more restrictive requirements are placed on more highly volatile securities traded in the nasdaq market 
in comparison  the nyse permits loans of up to of the value of the equity securities in a customer s account 
further discussion of credit risk appears in item  under the caption notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in its operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in its internal control processes 
the company operates in diverse markets and it is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems  human error or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance policies and procedures including the maintenance of disaster recovery facilities and procedures related thereto that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
with respect to its trading activities  the company has procedures designed to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected on the company s books on a timely basis 
with respect to client activities  the company operates a system of internal controls designed to ensure that transactions and other account activity new account solicitation  transaction authorization  transaction processing  billing and collection are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled

the company is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its activities 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly intense over the past few years and the company  as well as others in the industry  has been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny 
the company has comprehensive procedures for addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  granting of credit  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping

see further discussion on the company s reserve policy in item  under the caption critical accounting policies  item  legal proceedings and item  regulation 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the company does not rely on off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  special purpose or limited purpose entities to manage risk 
value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the sec s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading of financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows in thousands of dollars fiscal as at december  high low average interest rate risk equity price risk commodity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio at december  compared to december   which include a larger position in fixed income securities on an overall portfolio which is higher than at december  the company s portfolio as at december  includes approximately   in in corporate equities  which are co related to deferred compensation liabilities and which do not bear any value at risk to the company 
the company did not use derivative financial instruments to hedge market risk in fiscal  but did hold a small hedge posit ion in which is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such information is hereby incorporated by reference 
further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item  risk management 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions 
likewise  the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
