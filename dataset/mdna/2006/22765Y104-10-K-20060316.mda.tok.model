item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein 
our cash flow consists almost exclusively of distributions from crosstex energy  lp our only cash generating assets are our partnership interests in crosstex energy  lp our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of the partnership to make distributions to its partners 
the amount of cash that the partnership can distribute to its partners  including us  each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the amount of natural gas transported in its gathering and transmission pipelines  the level of the partnership s processing and treating operations  the fees the partnership charges and the margins it realizes for its services  the price of natural gas  the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  and its level of operating costs 
in addition  the actual amount of cash the partnership will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond its control  including the level of capital expenditures the partnership makes  the cost of acquisitions  if any  its debt service requirements  fluctuations in its working capital needs  restrictions on distributions contained in its bank credit facility  its ability to make working capital borrowings under its bank credit facility to pay distributions  prevailing economic conditions  and the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner for the proper conduct of its business 

table of contents we are largely prohibited from engaging in activities that compete with the partnership 
so long as we own the general partner of the partnership  we are prohibited by an omnibus agreement with the partnership from engaging in the business of gathering  transmitting  treating  processing  storing and marketing natural gas and transporting  fractionating  storing and marketing ngls  except to the extent that the partnership  with the concurrence of its independent directors comprising its conflicts committee  elects not to engage in a particular acquisition or expansion opportunity 
this exception for competitive activities is relatively limited 
although we have no current intention of pursuing the types of opportunities that we are permitted to pursue under the omnibus agreement such as competitive opportunities that the partnership declines to pursue or permitted activities that are not competition with the partnership  the provisions of the omnibus agreement may  in the future  limit activities that we would otherwise pursue 
in our corporate charter  we have renounced business opportunities that may be pursued by the partnership or by affiliated stockholders that hold a majority of our common stock 
in our restated charter and in accordance with delaware law  we have renounced any interest or expectancy we may have in  or being offered an opportunity to participate in  any business opportunities  including any opportunities within those classes of opportunity currently pursued by the partnership  presented to persons who are officers or directors of the company or who  on october   were  and at the time of presentation are  stockholders of the company or to persons who are affiliates or associates of such officers  directors or stockholders  if the company is prohibited from participating in such opportunities by the omnibus agreement  or two affiliated stockholders with a substantial interest in our company  yorktown energy partners iv  lp and yorktown energy partners v  lp  or any other investment fund sponsored or managed by yorktown partners llc  including any fund still to be formed  or to any of our directors who is an affiliate or designate of these entities 
as a result of this renunciation  these officers  directors and stockholders should not be deemed to be breaching any fiduciary duty to us if they or their affiliates or associates pursue opportunities presented as described above 
substantially all of our partnership interests in the partnership are subordinated to the common units 
we own  units representing limited partner interests in the partnership  of which  are subordinated units and  are common units 
during the subordination period  the subordinated units will not receive any distributions in a quarter until the partnership has paid the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit  plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters  on all of the outstanding common units 
distributions on the subordinated units are therefore more uncertain than distribution on the common units 
furthermore  no distributions may be made on the incentive distribution rights until the minimum quarterly distribution has been paid on all outstanding units 
therefore  distributions with respect to the incentive distribution rights are even more uncertain than distributions on the subordinated units 
neither the subordinated units nor the incentive distribution rights are entitled to any arrearages from prior quarters 
generally  the subordination period ends  and the subordinated units convert to common units  only after december  and only upon the satisfaction of certain financial tests 
although we control the partnership  the general partner owes fiduciary duties to the partnership and the unitholders 
conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationship between us and our affiliates  including the general partner  on the one hand  and the partnership and its limited partners  on the other hand 
the directors and officers of crosstex energy gp  llc have fiduciary duties to manage the general partner in a manner beneficial to us  its owner 
at the same time  the general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage the partnership in a manner beneficial to the partnership and its limited partners 
the board of directors of crosstex energy gp  llc will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict 
the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our stockholders 

table of contents for example  conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations the allocation of shared overhead expenses to the partnership and us  the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates  on the one hand  and the partnership  on the other hand  including obligations under the omnibus agreement  the determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to the partnership s partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of the partnership s business  the determination whether to make borrowings under the capital facility to pay distributions to partners  and any decision we make in the future to engage in activities in competition with the partnership as permitted under our omnibus agreement with the partnership 
if the general partner is not fully reimbursed or indemnified for obligations and liabilities it incurs in managing the business and affairs of the partnership  its value  and therefore the value of our common stock  could decline 
the general partner may make expenditures on behalf of the partnership for which it will seek reimbursement from the partnership 
in addition  under delaware partnership law  the general partner  in its capacity as the general partner of the partnership  has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  such as its debts and environmental liabilities  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
to the extent the general partner incurs obligations on behalf of the partnership  it is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by the general partner 
in the event that the partnership is unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify the general partner  the general partner may be unable to satisfy these liabilities or obligations  which would reduce its value and therefore the value of our common stock 
acquisitions by the partnership typically increase its debt and subject it to other substantial risks  which could adversely affect its results of operations 
the partnership s future financial performance will depend  in part  on its ability to make acquisitions of assets and businesses at attractive prices 
from time to time  the partnership will evaluate and seek to acquire assets or businesses that it believes complements existing business and related assets 
the partnership may acquire assets or businesses that it plans to use in a manner materially different from their prior owner s use 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including the inability to integrate the operations of acquired businesses or assets  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses  a significant increase in the partnership s indebtedness  and potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems 
management s assessment of these risks is necessarily inexact and may not reveal or resolve all existing or potential problems associated with an acquisition 
realization of any of these risks could adversely affect the partnership s operations and cash flows 
if the partnership consummates any future acquisition  its capitalization and results of operations may change significantly  and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that the partnership will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
the partnership continues to consider large acquisition candidates and transactions 
the integration  financial and other risks discussed above will be amplified if the size of the partnership s future acquisitions increases 
the partnership s acquisition strategy is based  in part  on expectation of ongoing divestitures of gas processing and transportation assets by large industry participants 
a material decrease in such divestitures will limit the partnership s opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect its growth plans 

table of contents the partnership is vulnerable to operational  regulatory and other risks associated with south louisiana and the gulf of mexico  including the effects of adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes  because a significant portion of its assets are located in south louisiana 
the partnership s operations and revenues will be significantly impacted by conditions in south louisiana because the partnership has a significant portion of its assets located in south louisiana 
this concentration of activity makes the partnership more vulnerable than many of its competitors to the risks associated with louisiana and the gulf of mexico  including adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms  delays or decreases in production  the availability of equipment  facilities or services  and changes in the regulatory environment 
because a significant portion of the partnership s operations could experience the same condition at the same time  these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on the partnership s results of operations than they might have on other midstream companies who have operations in a more diversified geographic area 
in addition  the partnership s operations in south louisiana are dependent upon continued deep shelf drilling in the gulf of mexico 
the deep shelf in the gulf of mexico is an area that has had limited historical drilling activity 
this is due  in part  to its geological complexity and depth 
deep shelf development is more expensive and inherently more risky than conventional shelf drilling 
a decline in the level of deep shelf drilling in the gulf of mexico could have a adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
the partnership s profitability is dependent upon prices and market demand for natural gas and ngls  which are beyond its control and have been volatile 
the partnership is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these risks are based upon three components of the partnership s business it purchases certain volumes of natural gas at a price that is a percentage of a relevant index  certain processing contracts for its gregory system and its plaquemine and gibson processing plants expose it to natural gas and ngl commodity price risks  and part of its fees from its conroe and seminole gas plants as well as those acquired in the el paso acquisition are based on a portion of the ngls produced  and  therefore  is subject to commodity price risks 
the margins the partnership realizes from purchasing and selling a portion of the natural gas that it transports through its pipeline systems decrease in periods of low natural gas prices because its gross margins related to such purchases are based on a percentage of the index price 
for the years ended december  and  the partnership purchased approximately and  respectively  of its gas at a percentage of relevant index 
accordingly  a decline in the price of natural gas could have an adverse impact on its results of operations 
a portion of the partnership s profitability is affected by the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices 
for a component of the partnership s gregory system and its plaquemine plant and gibson plant volumes  the partnership purchases natural gas  processes natural gas and extracts ngls  and then sells the processed natural gas and ngls 
a portion of the partnership s profits from the plants acquired in the el paso acquisition is dependent on ngl prices and elections by the partnership and the producers 
in cases where the partnership processes gas for producers when they have the ability to decide whether to process their gas  the partnership may elect to receive a processing fee or it may retain and sell the ngls and keep the producer whole on its sale of natural gas 
since the partnership extracts energy content  which it measures in btus  from the gas stream in the form of the liquids or consumes it as fuel during processing  the partnership reduces the btu content of the natural gas 
accordingly  the partnership s margins under these arrangements can be negatively affected in periods in which the value of natural gas is high relative to the value of ngls 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile and we expect this volatility to continue 
for example  in  the nymex settlement price for natural gas for the prompt month contract ranged from a high of per mmbtu to a low of per mmbtu 
in  the same index ranged from per mmbtu to per mmbtu 
a composite of the opis mt 
belvieu monthly average liquids price based upon the partnership s average liquids composition in ranged from a high of approximately per gallon to a low of 
table of contents approximately per gallon 
in  the same composite ranged from approximately per gallon to approximately per gallon 
the partnership may not be successful in balancing its purchases and sales 
in addition  a producer could fail to deliver contracted volumes or deliver in excess of contracted volumes  or a consumer could purchase less than contracted volumes 
any of these actions could cause the partnership s purchases and sales not to be balanced 
if the partnership s purchases and sales are not balanced  the partnership will face increased exposure to commodity price risks and could have increased volatility on its operating income 
the markets and prices for residue gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond the partnership s control 
these factors include demand for oil  natural gas and ngls  which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors  including the impact of weather on the demand for oil and natural gas  the level of domestic oil and natural gas production  the level of domestic industrial and manufacturing activity  the availability of imported oil and natural gas  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations  the availability of local  intrastate and interstate transportation systems  the availability and marketing of competitive fuels  the impact of energy conservation efforts  and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation 
the partnership must continually compete for natural gas supplies  and any decrease in its supplies of natural gas could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
competition is intense in many of the partnership s markets 
the principal areas of competition include obtaining gas supplies and the marketing and transportation of natural gas and ngls 
the partnership s competitors include major integrated oil companies  interstate and intrastate pipelines and natural gas gatherers and processors 
some of the partnership s competitors offer more services or have greater financial resources and access to larger natural gas supplies than it does 
if the partnership is unable to maintain or increase the throughput on its systems by accessing new natural gas supplies to offset the natural decline in reserves  its business and financial results could be materially  adversely affected 
in addition  the partnership s future growth will depend  in part  upon whether it can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in its currently connected supplies 
in order to maintain or increase throughput levels in the partnership s natural gas gathering systems and asset utilization rates at its treating and processing plants  the partnership must continually contract for new natural gas supplies 
the partnership may not be able to obtain additional contracts for natural gas supplies 
the primary factors affecting the partnership s ability to connect new wells to its gathering facilities include its success in contracting for existing natural gas supplies that are not committed to other systems and the level of drilling activity near its gathering systems 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
tax policy changes could have a negative impact on drilling activity  reducing supplies of natural gas available to the partnership s systems 
the partnership has no control over producers and depends on them to maintain sufficient levels of drilling activity 
a material decrease in natural gas production or in the level of drilling activity in the partnership s principal geographic areas for a prolonged period  as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise  likely would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position 

table of contents a substantial portion of the partnership s assets are connected to natural gas reserves that will decline over time  and the cash flows associated with those assets will decline accordingly 
a substantial portion of the partnership s assets  including its gathering systems and treating plants  is dedicated to certain natural gas reserves and wells for which the production will naturally decline over time 
accordingly  the partnership s cash flows associated with these assets will also decline 
if the partnership is unable to access new supplies of natural gas either by connecting additional reserves to its existing assets or by constructing or acquiring new assets that have access to additional natural gas reserves  its cash flows may decline 
growing the partnership s business by constructing new pipelines and processing and treating facilities subjects the partnership to construction risks  risks that natural gas supplies will not be available upon completion of the facilities and risks of construction delay and additional costs due to obtaining rights of way 
one of the ways the partnership intends to grow its business is through the construction of additions to its existing gathering systems and construction of new pipelines and gathering  processing and treating facilities 
the construction of pipelines and gathering  processing and treating facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital  which may exceed the partnership s expectations 
generally  the partnership may have only limited natural gas supplies committed to these facilities prior to their construction 
moreover  the partnership may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize 
the partnership may also rely on estimates of proved reserves in its decision to construct new pipelines and facilities  which may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas to achieve the partnership s expected investment return  which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the partnership faces the risks of construction delay and additional costs due to obtaining rights of way 
the partnership is in the process of completing a mile pipeline and associated gathering lines from an area near fort worth  texas into new markets accessed by the ngpl pipeline system 
drilling success in the barnet shale formation in the area has expanded productions beyond the capacity of the existing pipeline infrastructure to efficiently access markets 
capital cost to construct the pipeline and associated facilities are estimated to be approximately million 
the partnership has limited control over the development of certain assets because it is not the operator 
as the owner of non operating interests in the seminole and blue water gas processing plants  the partnership does not have the right to direct or control the operation of the plants 
as a result  the success of the activities conducted at these plants  which are operated by a third party  may be affected by factors outside of the partnership s control 
the failure of the third party operator to make decisions  perform its services  discharge its obligations  deal with regulatory agencies or comply with laws  rules and regulations affecting these plants  including environmental laws and regulations  in a proper manner could result in material adverse consequences to the partnership s interest and adversely affect the partnership s results of operations 
the partnership expects to encounter significant competition in any new geographic areas into which it seeks to expand and its ability to enter such markets may be limited 
as the partnership expands its operations into new geographic areas  the partnership expects to encounter significant competition for natural gas supplies and markets 
competitors in these new markets will include companies larger than the partnership  which have both lower capital costs and greater geographic coverage  as well as smaller companies  which have lower total cost structures 
as a result  the partnership may not be able to successfully develop acquired assets and markets located in new geographic areas and its results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents the partnership is exposed to the credit risk of its customers and counterparties  and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by its customers could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by the partnership s customers are a major concern in its business 
the partnership is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by the partnership s customers could adversely affect its results of operations 
the partnership may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers  which would reduce its revenues and limit its future profitability 
the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with the partnership s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond the partnership s control  including competition from other pipelines  and the price of  and demand for  natural gas in the markets it serves 
for the year ended december   approximately of the partnership s sales of gas which were transported using its physical facilities were to industrial end users and utilities 
as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices  end users and utilities are reluctant to enter into long term purchase contracts 
many end users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time 
some of these end users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternate fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market 
because there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with the partnership in the marketing of natural gas  the partnership often competes in the end user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price 
the inability of the partnership s management to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on its profitability 
the partnership depends on certain key customers  and the loss of any key customer could adversely affect financial results 
the partnership derives a significant portion of its revenues from contracts with key customers 
to the extent that these and other customers may reduce volumes of natural gas purchased under existing contracts  celp would be adversely affected unless it was able to make comparably profitable arrangements with other customers 
agreements with key customers provide for minimum volumes of natural gas that each customer must purchase until the expiration of the term of the applicable agreement  subject to certain force majeure provisions 
customers may default on their obligations to purchase the minimum volumes required under the applicable agreements 
the partnership s business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be fully covered by insurance 
the partnership s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering  compressing  treating and processing of natural gas and storage of residue gas  including damage to pipelines  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes  floods  fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism  inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leaks of natural gas  ngls and other hydrocarbons  and fires and explosions 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of the partnership s related operations 
the partnership s operations are concentrated in texas  louisiana and the mississippi gulf coast  and a natural disaster or other hazard affecting this region could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
the partnership is not fully insured against all risks incident to its business 
in accordance with typical industry practice  the partnership does not have any property insurance on any of its 
table of contents underground pipeline systems that would cover damage to the pipelines 
the partnership is not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur  other than those considered to be sudden and accidental 
the partnership s business interruption insurance covers only its gregory processing plant 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect the partnership s operations and financial condition 
the threat of terrorist attacks has resulted in increased costs  and future war or risk of war may adversely impact the partnership s results of operations and its ability to raise capital 
terrorist attacks or the threat of terrorist attacks cause instability in the global financial markets and other industries  including the energy industry 
uncertainty surrounding retaliatory military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect the partnership s operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  and transmission and distribution facilities  could be direct targets  or indirect casualties  of an act of terror 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism  the war in iraq or future developments could also affect the partnership s ability to raise capital 
changes in the insurance markets attributable to the threat of terrorist attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for the partnership to obtain 
the partnership s insurance policies now generally exclude acts of terrorism 
such insurance is not available at what the partnership believes to be acceptable pricing levels 
a lower level of economic activity could also result in a decline in energy consumption  which could adversely affect the partnership s revenues or restrict its future growth 
federal  state or local regulatory measures could adversely affect the partnership s business 
while the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  generally does not regulate any of the partnership s operations  directly or indirectly  ferc influences certain aspects of the partnership s business and the market for its products 
as a raw natural gas gatherer  the partnership generally is exempt from ferc regulation under the natural gas act of  or nga  but ferc regulation still significantly affects the partnership s business 
in recent years  ferc has pursued pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines 
however  we cannot assure you that ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transportation capacity 
some of the partnership s intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines are subject to regulation as a common carrier and as a gas utility by the texas railroad commission  or trrc 
the trrc s jurisdiction extends to both rates and pipeline safety 
the rates the partnership charges for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under texas law unless challenged in a complaint 
should a complaint be filed or should regulation become more active  the partnership s business may be adversely affected 
other state and local regulations also affect the partnership s business 
the partnership is subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states where it operates 
ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take  without undue discrimination  natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling 
similarly  common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer 
these statutes have the effect of restricting the partnership s right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas 
federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states  and some of the states in which the partnership operates have adopted complaint based or other limited economic regulation of natural gas gathering activities 
states in which the partnership operates that have adopted some form of complaint based regulation  like oklahoma and texas  generally allow natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination 
the states in which the partnership conducts operations administer federal pipeline safety standards under the pipeline safety act of the rural gathering exemption under the natural gas pipeline safety act of presently exempts substantial portions of the partnership s gathering facilities from jurisdiction under that statute  including those portions located outside of cities  towns  or any area designated as residential or commercial  such as a subdivision or shopping center 
the rural gathering exemption  however  may be restricted in the future  and it 
table of contents does not apply to the partnership s natural gas transmission pipelines 
in response to recent pipeline accidents in other parts of the country  congress and the department of transportation have passed or are considering heightened pipeline safety requirements 
compliance with pipeline integrity regulations issued by the trrc  or those issued by the united states department of transportation  or dot  in december of could result in substantial expenditures for testing  repairs and replacement 
trrc regulations require periodic testing of all intrastate pipelines meeting certain size and location requirements 
the partnership s costs relating to compliance with the required testing under the trrc regulations were approximately million for the year ended december  and million in and the partnership expects the costs for compliance with trrc and dot regulations to be million in the aggregate during and if the partnership s pipelines fail to meet the safety standards mandated by the trrc or the dot regulations  then it may be required to repair or replace sections of such pipelines  the cost of which cannot be estimated at this time 
the partnership s business involves hazardous substances and may be adversely affected by environmental regulation 
many of the operations and activities of the partnership s gathering systems  plants and other facilities  including the natural gas and processing liquids business in south louisiana recently acquired from el paso  are subject to significant federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations impose obligations related to air emissions and discharge of pollutants from the partnership s facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances and other wastes that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by the partnership or locations to which it has sent wastes for treatment or disposal 
various governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and the permits issued under them  and violators are subject to administrative  civil and criminal penalties  including civil fines  injunctions or both 
strict  joint and several liability may be incurred under these laws and regulations for the remediation of contaminated areas 
private parties  including the owners of properties through which the partnership s gathering systems pass  may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage 
there is inherent risk of the incurrence of significant environmental costs and liabilities in the partnership s business due to its handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions related to its operations  historical industry operations  waste disposal practices and the prior use of natural gas flow meters containing mercury 
in addition  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the partnership s compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
the partnership may incur material environmental costs and liabilities 
furthermore  the partnership s insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against the partnership 
the partnership s business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits 
new environmental regulations might adversely affect the partnership s products and activities  including processing  storage and transportation  as well as waste management and air emissions 
federal and state agencies could also impose additional safety requirements  any of which could affect the partnership s profitability 
the partnership s use of derivative financial instruments has in the past and could in the future result in financial losses or reduce its income 
the partnership uses over the counter price and basis swaps with other natural gas merchants and financial institutions  and it uses futures and option contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
use of these instruments is intended to reduce the partnership s exposure to short term volatility in commodity prices 
the partnership could incur financial losses or fail to recognize the full value of a market opportunity as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if one of its counterparties fails to perform under a contract 

table of contents due to the partnership s lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in its gathering  transmission  treating  processing and producer services businesses would materially impact its financial condition 
the partnership relies exclusively on the revenues generated from its gathering  transmission  treating  processing and producer services businesses  and as a result its financial condition depends upon prices of  and continued demand for  natural gas and ngls 
due to the partnership s lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in one of these businesses would have a significantly greater impact on its financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets 
the partnership s success depends on key members of its management  the loss or replacement of whom could disrupt its business operations 
the partnership depends on the continued employment and performance of the officers of crosstex energy gp  llc and key operational personnel 
crosstex energy gp  llc has entered into employment agreements with each of its executive officers 
if any of these officers or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced  the partnership s business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the partnership does not maintain any key man life insurance for any officers

overview crosstex energy  inc is a delaware corporation formed on april  to engage through its subsidiaries in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls 
on july   we formed crosstex energy  lp  a delaware limited partnership  to acquire indirectly substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of its predecessor  crosstex energy services  ltd 
our assets consist almost exclusively of 
table of contents partnership interests in crosstex energy  lp  a publicly traded limited partnership engaged in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls 
these partnership interests consist of i  common units and  subordinated units  representing approximately of the limited partner interests in crosstex energy  lp and ii ownership interest in crosstex energy gp  lp  the general partner of crosstex energy  lp  which owns a general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in crosstex energy  lp our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
the partnership is required by its partnership agreement to distribute all its cash on hand at the end of each quarter  less reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business or to provide for future distributions 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter  and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 
distributions by the partnership have increased from per unit for the quarter ended march  its first full quarter of operation after its initial public offering  to per unit for the quarter ended december  as a result  our distributions from the partnership pursuant to our ownership of our  common and subordinated units have increased from million for the quarter ended march  to million for the quarter ended december   our distributions pursuant to our general partner interest have increased from  to approximately million  and our distributions pursuant to our incentive distribution rights have increased from nothing to million 
as a result  we have increased our dividend from per share for the quarter ended march  the first dividend payout after our initial public offering to per share for the quarter ended december  since we control the general partner interest in the partnership  we reflect our ownership interest in the partnership on a consolidated basis  which means that our financial results are combined with the partnership s financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries 
the interest owned by non controlling partners share of income is reflected as an expense in our results of operations 
we have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership  and our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
our consolidated results of operations are derived from the results of operations of the partnership and also include our gains on the issuance of units in the partnership  deferred taxes  interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income  interest income expense and general and administrative expenses not reflected in the partnership s results of operation 
accordingly  the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primarily reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the partnership 
the partnership has two industry segments  midstream and treating  with a geographic focus along the texas gulf coast and in mississippi and louisiana 
the partnership s midstream division focuses on the gathering  processing  transmission and marketing of natural gas and ngls  as well as providing certain producer services  while the treating division focuses on the removal of contaminants from natural gas and ngls to meet pipeline quality specifications 
for the year ended december   of our gross margin was generated in the midstream division  with the balance in the treating division 
celp focuses on gross margin to manage its business because its business is generally to purchase and resell gas for a margin  or to gather  process  transport  market or treat gas or ngls for a fee 
celp buys and sells most of its gas at a fixed relationship to the relevant index price so margins are not significantly affected by changes in gas prices 
as explained under commodity price risk below  it enters into financial instruments to reduce volatility in gross margin due to price fluctuations 
since the formation of the partnership s predecessor  it has grown significantly as a result of construction and acquisition of gathering and transmission pipelines and treating and processing plants 
from january  through december   the partnership has invested over million to develop or acquire new assets 
the purchased assets were acquired from numerous sellers at different periods and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations for such acquisitions are included in our 
table of contents financial statements only from the applicable date of the acquisition 
as a consequence  the historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable 
the partnership s midstream segment margins are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  transported  purchased and sold through its pipeline systems  processed at its processing facilities and the volumes of natural gas liquids handled at its fractionation facilities 
treating segment margins are largely a function of the number and size of treating plants as well as fees earned for removing impurities and from natural gas liquids at a non operated processing plant 
celp generates revenues from five primary sources purchasing and reselling or transporting natural gas on the pipeline systems it owns  processing natural gas at its processing plants and fractionating and marketing the recovered natural gas liquids  treating natural gas at its treating plants  recovering carbon dioxide and natural gas liquids at a non operated processing plant  and providing off system marketing services for producers 
the bulk of the partnership s operating profits are derived from the margins it realizes for purchasing and reselling natural gas through its pipeline systems 
generally  the partnership buys gas from a producer  plant tailgate  or transporter at either a fixed discount to a market index or a percentage of the market index 
the partnership then transports and resells the gas 
the resale price is based on the same index price at which the gas was purchased  and  if the partnership is to be profitable  at a smaller discount or larger premium to the index than it was purchased 
the partnership attempts to execute all purchases and sales substantially concurrently  or it enters into a future delivery obligation  thereby establishing the basis for the margin it will receive for each natural gas transaction 
the partnership s gathering and transportation margins related to a percentage of the index price can be adversely affected by declines in the price of natural gas 
see commodity price risk below for a discussion of how it manages its business to reduce the impact of price volatility 
processing and fractionation revenues are largely fee based 
processing fees are largely based on either a percentage of the liquids volume recovered  or a fixed fee per unit processed 
fractionation and marketing fees are generally fixed per unit of product 
the partnership generates treating revenues under three arrangements a volumetric fee based on the amount of gas treated  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively  a fixed fee for operating the plant for a certain period  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively  or a fee arrangement in which the producer operates the plant  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses are costs directly associated with the operations of a particular asset 
among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision and associated transportation and communication costs  property insurance  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance expenses  measurement and utilities 
these costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges  and therefore  do not normally decrease or increase significantly in the short term with decreases or increases in the volume of gas moved through the asset 
we modified certain terms of certain outstanding options on our common stock in the first quarter of which allowed the option holders to elect to be paid in cash for the modified options based on the fair value of the options 
these modifications resulted in variable award accounting for the modified options until the option holders elected to cash out the options or the election to cash out the options lapsed 
we were responsible for paying the intrinsic value of the options for the holders who elected to cash out their options 
december  was the last valuation date that a holder of modified options could elect the cash out alternative 
accordingly  effective 
table of contents january   we ceased applying variable accounting for the remaining modified options 
we recognized total compensation expense of approximately million related to these modified options in the partnership has grown significantly through asset purchases in recent years  which creates many of the major differences when comparing operating results from one period to another 
the most significant asset purchases since january   are the acquisitions of the defs assets  the lig assets  and the el paso processing and liquids business in south louisiana 
it also acquired treating operations totaling million in on november  celp acquired el paso corporation s processing and liquids business in south louisiana for million 
the assets acquired include bcf d of processing capacity   barrels per day of fractionation capacity  million barrels of underground storage and miles of liquids transport lines 
the primary facilities and other assets acquired consist of the eunice processing plant and fractionation facility  the pelican processing plant  the sabine pass processing plant  a interest in the blue water gas processing plant  the riverside fractionator and loading facility  the cajun sibon pipeline and the napoleonville natural gas liquid storage facility 
on january  the partnership acquired all of the assets of graco operations for million 
graco s assets consisted of treating plants and associated inventory 
on may  it acquired all of the assets of cardinal gas services for million 
cardinal s assets consisted of nine gas treating plants  operating wellhead gas processing plants for dewpoint suppression  and equipment inventory 
in april the partnership acquired lig pipeline company and its subsidiaries collectively  lig from a subsidiary of american electric power aep for million in cash 
the principal assets acquired consist of approximately  miles of gas gathering and transmission systems located in parishes extending from northwest and north central louisiana through the center of the state to the south and southeast louisiana and five processing plants  including three idle plants that straddle the pipeline in three locations and have a total processing capacity of  mmbtu d 
the system has a throughput capacity of  mmbtu d and average throughput at the time of our acquisition was approximately  mmbtu d 
customers include power plants  municipal gas systems  and industrial markets located principally in the industrial corridor between new orleans and baton rouge 
the lig system is connected to several interconnected pipelines and the jefferson island storage facility providing access to additional system supply 
it subsequently sold one of the idle plants with a capacity of  mmbtu d in september and realized a gain on sale of million 
the partnership acquired the duke energy field services assets  or defs assets  in june for million in cash 
the principal assets acquired were the mississippi pipeline system  a mile natural gas gathering and transmission system in south central mississippi that serves utility and industrial customers  and a non operating interest in the seminole gas processing plant  which provides carbon dioxide separation and sulfur removal services for several major oil companies in west texas 
the acquisition provided celp with a new core area for growth in south central mississippi  expanded its presence in west texas and enabled it to enter the business of carbon dioxide separation 
other assets 
we own two inactive gas plants and a receivable associated with the enron corp 
bankruptcy in addition to our limited and general partner interests in the partnership 
the two gas plants are the jonesville processing plant  which has been largely inactive since the beginning of  and the clarkson plant  acquired shortly before the partnership s initial public offering 
in the third quarter of  we fully impaired our investment in the jonesville plant 
impact of federal income taxes 
crosstex energy  inc is a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as such  our federal taxable income is subject to tax at a maximum rate of under current law 
we expect to have significant amounts of taxable income allocated to us as a result of our investment in the partnership units particularly because of remedial allocations that will be made among the unitholders and because of the general partner s incentive distribution rights  which we will benefit from as the sole owner of the general partner 
taxable income allocated to us by the partnership will increase over the years as the ratio of income to distributions increases for all of the unitholders 
we currently have a net operating loss carryforward of million as of december  for federal income taxes and state loss carryforwards of million 
we estimate that our net operating loss carryforwards will 
table of contents be utilized to offset federal taxable income in and in years after  however  we do not expect to have this net operating loss carryforward to offset our income 
as a result  we will have to pay tax on our federal taxable income at a maximum rate of under current law 
thus  the amount of money available to make cash distributions to our stock holders will decrease markedly after we use all of our net operating loss carryforward 
our use of this net operating loss carryforward will be limited if there is a greater than change in our stock ownership over a three year period 
however  we do not expect such a change in ownership to limit our utilization of carryforwards prior to their year expiration period 
commodity price risk the partnership s profitability has been and will continue to be affected by volatility in prevailing ngl product and natural gas prices 
changes in the prices of ngl products can correlate closely with changes in the price of crude oil 
ngl product and natural gas prices have been subject to significant volatility in recent years in response to changes in the supply and demand for crude oil  ngl products and natural gas 
profitability under the partnership s gas processing contracts is impacted by the margin between ngl sales prices and the cost of natural gas and may be negatively affected by decreases in ngl prices or increases in natural gas prices 
changes in natural gas prices impact profitability since the purchase price of a portion of the gas the partnership buys is based on a percentage of a particular natural gas price index for a period  while the gas is resold at a fixed dollar relationship to the same index 
therefore  during periods of low gas prices  these contracts can be less profitable than during periods of higher gas prices 
however  on most of the gas we buy and sell  margins are not affected by such changes because the gas is bought and sold at a fixed relationship to the relevant index 
therefore  while changes in the price of gas can have very large impacts on revenues and cost of revenues  the changes are equal and offsetting 
set forth in the table below is the volume of the natural gas purchased and sold at a fixed discount or premium to the index price and at a percentage discount or premium to the index price for the partnership s principal gathering and transmission systems and for its producer services business for the year ended december  year ended december  gas purchased gas sold fixed fixed amount percentage of amount percentage of asset or business to index index to index index in thousands of mmbtu s lig system south texas system other assets and activities gas sold is less than gas purchased due to production of natural gas liquids on certain assets included in the south texas system 
the partnership estimates that  due to the gas that it purchases at a percentage of index price  for each per mmbtu increase or decrease in the price of natural gas  its gross margins increase or decrease by approximately million on an annual basis before consideration of hedge positions 
as of december   it has hedged approximately of its exposure to such fluctuations in natural gas prices for celp expects to continue to hedge its exposure to gas prices when market opportunities appear attractive 
celp processes approximately of its volume at eunice  pelican  sabine and blue water under percent of proceeds contracts  under which it receives as a fee a portion of the liquids produced  and of volume as fixed fee per unit processed 
under percent of proceeds contracts  it is exposed to changes in the prices of natural gas liquids 
for the years and  it has purchased puts or entered into forward sales covering all of its anticipated minimum share of natural gas liquids production 
the partnership expects to continue to hedge its exposure to gas production which it purchases at a percentage of index when market opportunities appear attractive 

table of contents the partnership s processing plants at plaquemine and gibson have a variety of processing contract structures 
in general  the partnership buys gas under keep whole arrangements in which it bears the risk of processing  percentage of proceeds arrangements in which it receives a percentage of the value of the liquids recovered  and theoretical processing arrangements in which the settlement with the producer is based on an assumed processing result 
because the partnership has the ability to bypass certain volumes when processing is uneconomic  it can limit its exposure to adverse processing margins 
during periods when processing margins are favorable  the partnership can substantially increase the volumes it is processing 
for the year ended december   the partnership purchased a small amount approximately of the natural gas volumes on its gregory system under contracts in which it was exposed to the risk of loss or gain in processing the natural gas 
the partnership purchased the remaining approximately of the natural gas volumes on its gregory system at a spot or market price less a discount that includes a fixed margin for gathering  processing and marketing the natural gas and ngls at its gregory processing plant with no risk of loss or gain in processing the natural gas 
the partnership owns an undivided interest in the seminole gas processing plant  which is located in gaines county  texas 
the seminole plant has dedicated long term reserves from the seminole san andres unit  to which it also supplies carbon dioxide under a long term arrangement 
revenues at the plant are derived from a fee it charges producers for each mcf of carbon dioxide returned to the producer for reinjection 
the plant also receives of the ngls produced by the plant 
therefore  the partnership has commodity price exposure due to variances in the prices of ngls 
during  its share of ngls totaled million gallons at an average price of per gallon 
the partnership executed forward sales on approximately of its anticipated share of ngls 
gas prices can also affect the partnership s profitability indirectly by influencing drilling activity and related opportunities for gas gathering  treating and processing 
results of operations set forth in the table below is certain financial and operating data for the midstream and treating divisions for the periods indicated 
year ended december  midstream revenues midstream purchased gas midstream gross margin treating revenues treating purchased gas treating gross margin total gross margin midstream volumes mmbtu d gathering and transportation processing producer services treating plants in operation at year end year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross margin 
midstream gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to acquisitions  volatile prices in the last half of the year and operational improvements on existing systems 

table of contents the acquisition of el paso corporation s natural gas processing and liquids business in south louisiana contributed million of gross margin in the fourth quarter of the acquisition of the lig assets on april  contributed million to midstream gross margin in in our first full year of ownership 
in addition  the acquisition of all outside interests in crosstex pipeline partners  ltd 
as of december  accounted for a gross margin increase of million 
relatively high and volatile natural gas prices during the quarters created favorable margin opportunities on several systems  offset by the negative impact on processing margins of high gas prices  as certain gas was no longer economical to process 
the impact of these high and volatile gas prices on midstream operations was a gross margin increase of million 
during the fourth quarter  declines in gas prices created an imbalance gain of million and made processing more profitable 
operational improvements and volume increases contributed margin growth of million on the vanderbilt  arkoma  and denton county systems 
in addition  the gregory gathering system had a margin increase of million primarily due to two measurement disputes which were settled during the year 
treating gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in treating plants in service from plants at december  to plants at december  contributed approximately million in gross margin 
existing plant assets contributed million in gross margin growth due primarily to plant expansion projects and increased volumes 
the acquisition and installation of dew point control plants in contributed an additional million to gross margin 
profit on energy trading activities 
the profit on energy trading activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in profit on energy trading activities is primarily due to a volume decrease associated with contracts not renewed in this is an activity the partnership is de emphasizing 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
an increase of million was associated with the acquisition of the el paso assets 
increases of million were associated with the acquisition of the lig assets as they were owned for the entire year instead of nine months in midstream operating expenses also increased by million due to small acquisitions and expansions of systems and the addition of compressors or other rental services 
the growth in treating plants in service due to acquisition of the graco assets and the cardinal assets as well as internal growth increased operating expenses by million 
operations expense includes stock based compensation expense of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
a significant contributor was additional staffing related costs  an incremental million over the staff additions required to manage and optimize our acquisitions account for the majority of the change  although a number of leadership and strategic positions were added that will allow us to absorb future growth more efficiently 
other expenses related to growth  including office rent  utilities  and travel expenses  account for million of the increase 
general and administrative expense includes stock based compensation expense of million in and million in the increase in stock based compensation primarily relates to restricted stock and unit grants and million in accelerated options 
gain loss on derivatives 
we had a loss on derivatives of million for the year ended december  compared to a gain on derivatives of million for the year ended december  the loss in includes a million loss on put options acquired in the third quarter of related to the acquisition of the el paso assets and a loss of million associated with derivatives for the third party on system financial transactions and storage financial transactions primarily due to higher commodity prices at year end 
we acquired put options  or rights to sell a portion of the liquids from the plants at a fixed price over a two year period beginning january  for a premium of million as part of the overall risk management plan related to the acquisition of the el paso assets which closed on november  in december we sold a portion of these put options for million 
these put options did not qualify as hedges as of december  and were marked to market through our consolidated statement of operations 
the puts represent options  but not the obligation  to sell the 
table of contents related underlying liquids volumes at a fixed price 
as the price of the underlying liquids increased significantly in the period  the value of the put options declined  which is reflected in gain loss on derivatives 
gain on sale of property 
during  the partnership sold an inactive gas processing facility acquired as part of the lig acquisition  which accounted for a substantial part of the million gain on sale of property 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of the increase  the acquisition of the el paso assets contributed million and the lig assets contributed million 
new treating plants placed in service resulted in an increase of million 
the remaining million increase in depreciation and amortization is a result of expansion projects and other new assets  including the expansion of the dallas office  computer software and equipment  and expansions on midstream assets 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase relates primarily to an increase in average debt outstanding 
average higher interest rates also increased from to weighted average rate of in compared to in 
other income 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other income in includes related to a reimbursement for a construction project in excess of our costs for such project 
gain on issuance of units of the partnership 
as a result of the partnership issuing additional units in november at a price per unit greater than our equivalent carrying value  our share of the net assets in the partnership increased by million 
accordingly  we recognized a million gain in income tax expense 
we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred taxes are recorded for the differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities that will reverse in future periods 
our income tax provision was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in the tax provision was primarily due to the taxes provided on the million gain on issuance of units of the partnership during interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income 
the interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the partnership s net income decreased from million in to million in contributing to the decrease in the interest of non controlling partners 
the non controlling partners share of the partnership net income was further reduced by the increase in net income allocated to us for our incentive distributions which increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  income from the partnership is allocated to us for our incentive distributions less stock based compensation attributable to our options and restricted units with the remaining income being allocated pro rata to the general partner interest and the common units and subordinated units excluding senior subordinated units 
distributions from the partnership will generally be made to the common and subordinated unitholders other than the senior subordinated unitholders and to the company as the general partner  subject to the payment of incentive distributions to the extent that certain target levels of cash distributions are achieved 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  generally the company is entitled to of amounts the partnership distributes in excess of per unit  of the amounts the partnership distributes in excess of per unit and of amounts the partnership distributes in excess of per unit 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross margin 
midstream gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of the lig assets on april  and defs assets on june   which added an incremental million and million  respectively  to midstream gross margin 
the volume growth of  mmbtu d  or  in gathering  transportation  and processing was primarily due to the acquired lig and 
table of contents defs assets 
also contributing to improved margins were higher processing margins and volumes from existing gas processing operations  which increased margins by million from to treating gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was due to the seminole plant  one of the assets acquired from defs  being owned for a full year 
the seminole plant has increased from of operating income in to of operating income during  as the seminole plant was only owned for the last six months of also contributing to the significant growth was the placement of an additional plants in service since december   which was offset in part by plant retirements 
the net plant additions of generated million in additional gross margin 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
increases of million and million were associated with the acquisition of the defs and lig assets  respectively 
general operations expense expenses not directly related to specific assets was million for compared to million for the majority of the million increase was related to higher technical services support required by the newly acquired assets and additional expenditures related to our pipeline integrity program 
the growth in treating plants in service increased operating expenses by million 
stock based compensation expense included in operating expenses included million and million in and  respectively 
during  certain outstanding options were accounted for using variable accounting due to a cash out modification offered for such options and stock compensation expense was recognized because the estimated fair value of the options increased during the cash out modification offered during that caused the variable accounting treatment expired on december  and  effective january  the remaining options are accounted for as fixed options 
stock based compensation recognized in represents the amortization of costs associated with awards under long term incentive plans  including restricted units and option grants with exercise prices below market prices on the grant date 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
a significant part of the increased expenses was million of additional staffing related costs 
the staff additions required to manage and optimize our lig and defs acquisitions account for the majority of the change  although a number of leadership and strategic positions were added that will allow us to absorb future growth more efficiently 
consistent with staffing for future growth  an additional million in consulting costs were made to upgrade our systems  providing a more scalable infrastructure 
sarbanes oxley compliance costs were an additional million for compared to zero in other expenses  including audit and tax fees  office rent  k preparation fees and travel expenses  account for million of the increase 
stock based compensation included in general and administrative expenses was million and million in and  respectively 
during  certain outstanding options were accounted for using variable accounting due to a cash out modification offered for such options and stock compensation expense was recognized because the estimated fair value of the options increased during the cash out modification offered during that caused the variable accounting treatment expired on december  and  effective january   the remaining options are accounted for as fixed options 
stock based compensation recognized in represents the amortization of costs associated with awards under long term incentive plans  including restricted units and option grants with exercise prices below market prices on the grant date 
impairment 
an impairment of million was recognized during related to a processing plant that is owned directly by us 
this plant has been inactive since late when the operator of the wells behind the plant cancelled its drilling plans for the area 
an impairment of the contracts associated with the plant was recorded in but the value of the plant was not impaired because we intended to restart or relocate the plant 
drilling activity has increased in the area near the plant and processing margins have improved during so management decided to more fully evaluate the cost of restarting this idle plant 
management determined that it would be more commercially feasible to put a new plant at the plant site than to invest the capital necessary to restart the plant 
if we do not restart the plant  our engineers estimate that the plant would receive very little  if any  value upon the sale of the plant 
therefore  we have impaired the full value of the plant during 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase related to the defs assets was million and the increase related to the lig assets was million 
new treating plants placed in service resulted in an increase of million 
the remaining million increase in depreciation and amortization is a result of expansion projects and other new assets  including the expansion of the gregory plant and the consolidation of denton county assets 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase relates primarily to an increase in average debt outstanding 
average interest rates also increased from to weighted average rate of in compared to in 
other income 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other income in includes million related to a reimbursement for a construction project in excess of our costs for such projects 
interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income 
we recorded an expense of million in and million in associated with the interests of non controlling partners in the partnership 
this expense increased between periods because the partnership s net income increased by million from to and the non controlling partners ownership in the partnership increased from to in september as a result of the issuance of additional common units to the public shareholders 
the increases related to partnership net income and non controlling partner ownership were partially offset by the impact of incentive distributions increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  income from the partnership is allocated to us for its incentive distributions with the remaining income being allocated pro rata to the general partner interest and the common unit and subordinated units 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in the tax provision was primarily due to the taxes provided on the million gain on issuance of units of the partnership during partially offset by taxes provided on higher operating income in critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
compliance with the rules necessarily involves reducing a number of very subjective judgments to a quantifiable accounting entry or valuation 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
for further details on our accounting policies and a discussion of new accounting pronouncements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and commodity risk management 
we recognize revenue for sales or services at the time the natural gas or natural gas liquids are delivered or at the time the service is performed 
the partnership engages in price risk management activities in order to minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices

table of contents the partnership conducts off system gas marketing operations as a service to producers on systems that it does not own 
the partnership refers to these activities as part of commercial services 
in some cases  the partnership earns an agency fee from the producer for arranging the marketing of the producer s natural gas 
in other cases  the partnership purchases the natural gas from the producer and enters into a sales contract with another party to sell the natural gas 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for its commercial services activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices 
however  the partnership is subject to counterparty risk for both the physical and financial contracts 
the partnership s energy trading contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
 and accordingly  the partnership continues to use mark to market accounting for both physical and financial contracts of its commercial services business 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives and physical delivery contracts relating to the partnership s commercial services natural gas marketing activities are recognized in earnings as profit or loss on energy trading immediately 
for each reporting period  the partnership records the fair value of open energy trading contracts based on the difference between the quoted market price and the contract price 
accordingly  the change in fair value from the previous period in addition to the realized gains or losses on settled activities are reported as profit or loss on energy trading activities in the statements of operations 
sales of securities by subsidiaries 
we recognize gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations resulting from subsidiary sales of additional equity interest  including the partnership s limited partnership units  to unrelated parties 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the purchase and resale margins on natural gas  volume of gas available to the asset  markets available to the asset  operating expenses  and future natural gas prices and ngl product prices 
the amount of availability of gas to an asset is sometimes based on assumptions regarding future drilling activity  which may be dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of gas volumes and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located  the availability and prices of natural gas supply  the partnership s ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements  the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  the partnership s dependence on certain significant customers  producers  and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other midstream companies  including major energy producers 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
since the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional  fin provides that a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized if that fair value can be reasonably estimated  even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate 
table of contents the fair value of an asset retirement obligation under fasb statement no 
fin is effective at december  at december   the partnership cannot estimate the timing and or method of settlement for substantially all their assets where a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity exists and therefore adoption of fin had no impact on the partnership s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires compensation related to all stock based awards  including stock options be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the company will adopt this standard on january  and will elect the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased  or canceled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the unvested portion of awards that are granted prior to the effective date will be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
we expect that stock option grants will continue to be a significant part of employee compensation  and therefore  sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we do not expect sfas no 
r to significantly change recorded compensation expense related to grants of restricted partnership units and restricted cei shares 
had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  we believe the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the stock based employee compensation disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
as of december   we had million unit options and  cei stock options outstanding that had not yet vested  with a remaining estimated fair value of million and we had million unvested restricted units and million unvested restricted cei shares with a remaining estimated fair value of million 
based on these estimated fair values  we currently anticipate stock based compensation expense for will be million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the partnership s primary market risk is the risk related to changes in the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
in addition  it is also exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
at december   our variable rate debt had a carrying value of million  which approximated the fair value  and our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million 
we attempt to balance variable rate debt  fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest cost  interest rate volatility and financing risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate senior and subordinated debt 
the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
unless otherwise noted  the hypothetical change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether interest rates increase or decrease 
hypothetical carrying fair change in amount value a fair value in millions december  long term debt december  long term debt a fair value is based upon current market quotes and is the estimated amount required to purchase our long term debt on the open market 
this estimated value does not include any redemption premium 
commodity price risk 
approximately of the natural gas the partnership purchases for resale is purchased on a percentage of the relevant natural gas price index  as opposed to a fixed discount to that price 
as a result of purchasing the gas at a percentage of the index price  the partnership s margins are higher during periods of higher natural gas prices and lower during periods of lower natural gas prices 
the partnership has hedged approximately of its exposure to gas price fluctuations through the end of another price risk the partnership faces is the risk of mismatching volumes of gas bought or sold on a monthly price versus volumes bought or sold on a daily price 
the partnership enters each month with a balanced book of gas bought and sold on the same basis 
however  it is normal to experience fluctuations in the volumes of gas bought or sold under either basis  which leaves it with short or long positions that must be covered 
the partnership uses financial swaps to mitigate the exposure at the time it is created to maintain a balanced position 
the partnership has commodity price risk associated with its processed volumes of natural gas 
the partnership currently processes gas under four main types of contractual arrangements keep whole contracts under this type of contract  the partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant  and makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost shrink in processing 
the partnership s margins from these contracts are high during periods of high liquids prices relative to natural gas prices  and can be negative during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices 
the partnership controls risk on its current keep whole contracts through its ability to bypass processing when it is not profitable 
percent of proceeds contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered  and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink 
therefore  its margins from these contracts are greater during periods of high liquids prices 
the partnership s margins from processing cannot become negative under percent of proceeds contracts  but decline during periods of low ngl prices 

table of contents theoretical processing contracts under these contracts  the partnership stipulates with the producer the assumptions under which it will assume processing economics for settlement purposes  independent of actual processing results or whether the stream was actually processed 
these contracts tend to have an inverse result to the keep whole contracts  with better margins as processing economics worsen 
fee based contracts under these contracts the partnership has no commodity price exposure  and is paid a fixed fee per unit of volume that is treated or conditioned 
the partnership s primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows 
the partnership maintains a risk management committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
the partnership enters into hedges for natural gas and natural gas liquids using nymex futures or over the counter derivative financial instruments with only certain well capitalized counterparties which have been approved by its risk management committee 
the use of financial instruments may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments or counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that the partnership engages in hedging activities it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  the partnership is similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for its producer services activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices 
however  the partnership is subject to counterparty risk for both the physical and financial contracts 
the partnership accounts for certain of its producer services natural gas marketing activities as energy trading contracts or derivatives 
these energy trading contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives and physical delivery contracts relating to its producer services natural gas marketing activities are recognized in earnings as profit or loss on energy trading contracts immediately 
for each reporting period  we record the fair value of open energy trading contracts based in the difference between the quoted market price and the contract price 
accordingly  the change in fair value from the previous period is reported as profit or loss on energy trading contracts in the statement of operations 
in addition  realized gains and losses from settled contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges are also recorded in profit or loss on energy trading contracts 
as of december   outstanding natural gas swap agreements  natural gas liquids swap agreements  swing swap agreements  storage swap agreements  and other derivative instruments had a net fair value liability of million  excluding the fair value asset of million associated with the natural gas liquids puts 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical increase in gas and natural gas liquids prices would result in a an increase of approximately million in the net fair value liability of these contracts as of december  the value of the natural gas puts would also decrease as a result of an increase in natural gas liquids prices but we are unable to determine the impact of a price change 
our maximum loss on these puts is the remaining million cost for the puts 
credit risk 
the partnership is diligent in attempting to ensure that it issues credit to only credit worthy customers 
however  its purchase and resale of gas exposes it to significant credit risk  as the margin on any sale is generally a very small percentage of the total sale price 
therefore  a credit loss can be very large relative to the partnership s overall profitability
