item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of outsourced customer management and business process outsourcing solutions 
our comprehensive  balanced mix of sales  service  marketing and technology solutions includes customer care retention  technical support and customer acquisition  cross selling upselling as well as market research  database marketing  data capture collection  e mail management  collections and other back office business processing services 
we provide our services through operating centers located throughout the world  including the us  ireland  the uk  canada  australia  mexico  barbados and the philippines 
as of december   we had operations in contact centers from which we support domestic and multinational corporations and institutions  primarily in the financial  insurance  healthcare  telecommunications  information technology and consumer electronics industries 
we also offer a comprehensive suite of crm technologies  which are available on a hosted basis  for use by clients at their own in house facilities  or on a co sourced basis  in conjunction with our fully integrated  web enabled contact centers 
these technologies include automatic call distribution acd voice processing  interactive voice response ivr and advanced speech recognition asr  voice over internet protocol voip  contact management  automated e mail management and processing  sales force and marketing automation  alert notification and web self help  for the delivery of consistent  quality customer care across multiple channels 
our customer care retention clients typically enter into longer term  contractual relationships that may contain provisions for early contract terminations 
we generally operate under month to month contractual relationships with our telesales clients 
the pricing component of a contract is often comprised of a base service charge and separate charges for ancillary services 
our services are generally priced based upon per minute or hourly rates 
on occasion  we perform services for which we are paid incentives based on completed sales 
the nature of our business is such that we generally compete with other outsourced service providers as well as the retained in house call center operations of our customers 
this can create pricing pressures and impact the rates we can charge in our contracts 

table of contents revenue is recognized as the services are performed  generally based on hours or minutes of work performed  however  certain types of revenue relating to up front project setup costs must be deferred and recognized over a period of time  typically the length of the customer contract 
some of our client contracts have performance standards  which can result in adjustments to monthly billings if the standards are not met 
any required adjustments to our monthly billings are reflected in our revenue on an as incurred basis 
we refer to our revenue as either sales revenue or services revenue 
our sales revenue includes new customer acquisition and cross selling products and services to existing customers 
sales revenue is primarily outbound but does include inbound selling activities 
services revenue is generally inbound and encompasses all our other revenue  which is classified into two categories  customer service and ancillary services 
customer service includes customer care  help desk support  technical support and patient assistance whereas ancillary services includes market research  database marketing  technology hosting  data processing and data entry  and other non sales activities such as market survey work 
results for reflect the following increased revenue  which grew compared to revenue 
significant growth in customer care and other inbound call center services 
growth in our services revenue was 
sales revenue growth was as compared to a decline of in the prior year 
significantly reduced selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
continued growth in our philippines operations  which handled approximately of total production 
strengthened our competitive position in key vertical markets  primarily financial services and healthcare 
expanded our presence in other markets including technology  government and energy 
expanded the scope of our hosted technology offerings services with the introduction of outbound ivr alert services 
we improved our operations in due to our success in growing our client base  particularly in providing customer care management services in our key vertical markets  which often command higher revenue rates 
we were also successful in controlling our direct operating costs for labor and telecommunications 
the deployment of our centralized technology infrastructure helped us achieve savings in our telecom costs and increase the utilization of our workstations and software licenses 
on march   we announced a settlement to resolve the shingleton litigation 
under the terms of the settlement  ict agreed to pay million to settle all allegations relating to unpaid wages  bonuses and other claims  as well as payments for liquidated damages required by the wage act 
the impact of this settlement was accrued in our financial statements as of december   although the payment of the settlement occurred in of the million settlement  million was recovered from our insurance carriers during our results reflect the accrual for the settlement amount offset by million of insurance proceeds 
our results reflect insurance proceeds of million  offset by  actual legal expenses that we incurred in to complete the requirements set forth in the settlement 
as of december   there are no contingent liabilities remaining associated with this litigation 
our future profitability will be impacted by  among other things  our ability to expand our service offerings to existing customers as well as our ability to obtain new customers and grow new vertical markets 
our profitability is also impacted by our ability to manage costs and mitigate the effects of foreign currency exchange risk 
our business is very labor intensive and consequently  in an effort to reduce costs and be as competitive as possible in the marketplace  we have been reallocating some of our services to near shore and offshore contact centers  which typically have lower labor costs 
some of these benefits  however  are offset by the expanded training and associated costs we may incur because of our service mix 
many of our customer care services require more complex and costly training processes and to the extent we cannot bill these amounts to our clients  our profitability will be impacted 
in addition to the more complex training  the employees who work on our customer care programs are generally paid a higher hourly rate because of the more complex level of services they are providing 

table of contents we believe that our success in will be largely dependent on our ability to continue capturing new business and leveraging the investment we have made in our infrastructure by expanding our business service offerings 
we believe that major corporations will continue to leverage the skills of companies like ours and that the services outsourced will continue to expand beyond the contact center services that currently comprise the large majority of our business 
we plan to leverage our existing strength in the financial services  insurance and healthcare markets and provide additional business services to our customers in these industries 
to capitalize on these opportunities  we will continue to enhance the technologies we use 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue is typically calculated based on contracted per minute or hourly rates with customers 
we recognize revenue as services are performed  generally based on billable minutes or hours of work incurred 
some of our client contracts have performance standards  which can result in adjustments to monthly billings if the standards are not met 
any required adjustments to our monthly billings are reflected in our revenue on an as incurred basis 
in order to provide our business services solutions  we may incur certain up front project set up costs specific to each customer contract 
in certain instances  we can bill the customer for these costs  however  because the delivered item project set up services does not have stand alone value to the customer  revenue is deferred and recognized as services are provided over the contract term or until contract termination  should that occur prior to the end of the contract term 
to the extent we have billed these costs and there are no customer issues with collection  we will defer the project set up costs and amortize such amounts over the program period  over the remaining contract term or until contract termination 
the costs incurred are deferred only to the extent of the amounts billed 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are also recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  and is included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the deferred revenue related to up front project set up costs was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the deferred cost associated with this revenue is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the deferred costs totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical write off experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
other items considered in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts include the age of the receivables  the financial status of our customers and general economic conditions 
because the allowance for uncollectible accounts is an estimate  it may be necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if actual bad 
table of contents debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as certain of our customers  as well as certain of the industries we support  generate a high percentage of our total revenue and corresponding receivables 
accounts receivable  net were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of accounts receivable to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded through business combinations 
as of december  and  we had million and million of goodwill  respectively 
we also had  and  of other intangible assets  net of amortization  at december  and  respectively 
an impairment of these assets could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
an impairment exists when events have occurred or circumstances exist that would cause the fair value of these assets to fall below their carrying value 
although goodwill is no longer required to be amortized  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
this impairment review is performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
the impairment assessment is performed using projected cash flows 
on an interim basis  we also evaluate whether any events have occurred or whether any circumstances exist that could indicate an impairment of our goodwill 
other intangible assets are evaluated similar to other long lived assets in accordance with of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as discussed below 
for the years ended december   and there were no impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets is used to measure recoverability 
some of the more important factors we consider include our financial performance relative to our expected and historical performance  significant changes in the way we manage our operations  negative events that have occurred  and negative industry and economic trends 
if any impairment is indicated  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the assets  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
for the years ended december   and we recorded impairment charges of  and  respectively 
in  the impairment of assets was associated with facilities that we exited early 
net property and equipment as of december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
we also have deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss nol carryforwards for state tax purposes  foreign nol and federal tax credit carryforwards 
with respect to our state nols  we do not believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded against these deferred tax assets  of which  was recorded in at december   we have million of nol carryforwards relating to some of our foreign subsidiaries 
our subsidiary in australia has million of these nols  resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of million 
although the nols in australia do not expire under australian tax law and can be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years  management performed an evaluation on the expected utilization of the carryforwards and determined that it was more likely than not that these carryforwards will not be utilized 
therefore during  management increased the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that had been recorded for these nols by million 
as of december  the deferred tax assets associated with the australian nols have a full valuation allowance 
our ability to realize any of the above nols in the future will depend upon the company s ability to generate profits in the various tax jurisdictions they apply 

table of contents additionally  we have recorded as a deferred tax asset as of december  approximately million of federal tax credits  specifically research and development tax credits and work opportunity tax credits 
because we do not believe we will be able to realize all of these credits associated with research and development  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against them  of which  was recorded in although realization is not assured with our deferred tax assets  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
we will continue to evaluate and assess the realizability of all deferred tax assets and adjust valuation allowances  if required in the future 
restructuring charges as of december   we had a remaining accrual of million for the amount of estimated costs required to terminate the leases and close the facilities included in the december restructuring 
the original charge of million consisted of severance  site closure costs and asset impairments 
certain estimates were made in determining the amount of the charge for site closure costs and asset impairments  but no estimate for sublease income was made  given the market conditions at that time and the inability to find suitable tenants 
the amount of the charge will be subject to change over time if a suitable tenant is identified or to the extent we are able to negotiate early lease terminations 
during and  we did not enter into any sublease arrangements nor did we negotiate any termination settlements for the facilities that remain under contract 
the majority of cash payments made were related to the ongoing lease obligations 
accounting for contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships  or from our relationships with our employees 
management accounts for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires an estimated loss contingency be recorded when information available prior to issuance of a company s financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
and its interpretations further state that when there is a range of loss and no amount within that range is a better estimate than any other  that the minimum amount in the range should be accrued 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  the accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
at december   we had recorded an accrual related to the shingleton litigation 
our accrual at december  was million and reflected amounts that were agreed upon in a settlement that was announced on march  and approved by the court on june  we remitted the settlement amount in march to satisfy our obligation under the settlement 
these payments were partially funded with million of insurance proceeds that we received 
the insurance proceeds were recorded as a receivable within prepaid expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet at december  our results reflect the receipt of additional insurance proceeds of million 
as of december   we have no accruals remaining relating to the shingleton litigation

this amount included approximately  of direct costs incurred for the transaction

our operations will continue to require significant capital expenditures to support the growth of our business 
historically  equipment purchases have been financed through cash generated from operations  the credit facility and our ability to acquire equipment through operating leases 
we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flow generated from operations  the ability to acquire equipment through operating leases  and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures at least into we have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec to register  shares of common stock  including  shares by selling shareholders  plus an allowance for over allotments  to be sold in the future 
commitments and obligations as of december   we are also parties to various agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources 
we expect to satisfy our contractual obligations through cash flows generated from operations 
we would also consider accessing capital markets to meet our needs  although we can make no assurances that this type of financing would be available when we might need it 
the tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period description total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases telephone contract commitments credit facility total contractual obligations includes facility and equipment operating leases  some of which call for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent 
these obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs 
at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and were classified as long term 
the amount of the unused credit facility at december  was million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
to meet disclosure requirements  we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on our debt and other financial instruments 
information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that would be incurred under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit facility 
a change in market interest rates exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instrument 
borrowings under our credit facility are subject to variable libor or prime base rate pricing 
accordingly  a change basis points in the libor rate and the prime rate would have resulted in interest expense changing by  and  in and  respectively 
the rate on the million of outstanding borrowings at december  approximated market rates  thus  the fair value of the debt approximates its reported value 
in the past  management has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  we may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
foreign currency risk we have operations in canada  ireland  the united kingdom  australia  barbados  mexico and the philippines that are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of the foreign entities statements of operations from local currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
our most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue is generated in one foreign currency and corresponding expenses are generated in another foreign currency 
historically  our most significant exposure has been with our canadian operations  where revenue is generated in us dollars usd and the corresponding expenses are generated in canadian dollars cad 
when the value of the cad increases against the usd  cad denominated expenses increase and operating margins are negatively impacted 
partially offsetting this exposure is indigenous canadian business and associated profitability where usd profits will be higher in a period of a strong cad 
additionally  as we continue to outsource production to the philippines  we may experience similar foreign currency exposure as revenue is also generated in usd with the corresponding expenses generated in philippine pesos php 
we continue to hedge a portion of anticipated operating costs and payables associated with the cad  primarily payroll expenses  rental expenses and other known recurring expenses  on a monthly basis to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
during the latter part of  we decided to also hedge the currency exposure in the philippines for fiscal year  as the exchange rate of the php against the usd began to demonstrate increased volatility  which management expects to continue into similar to our cad strategy  we enter into derivative contracts which serve to hedge a portion of anticipated operating costs and payables associated with the php  primarily payroll expenses  rental expenses  telephone costs and other known recurring costs 

table of contents the impact of foreign currencies will continue to present economic challenges for us and could negatively impact overall earnings 
a change in the value of the usd relative to foreign currencies would have had an impact of approximately million and million on our annual earnings in and  respectively
