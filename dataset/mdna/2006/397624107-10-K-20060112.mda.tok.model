item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze our consolidated financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes  which appear elsewhere in this form k 
the terms greif  our company  we  us  and our as used in this discussion refer to greif  inc and subsidiaries 
our fiscal year begins on november and ends on october of the following year 
any references in this form k to the years  or  or to any quarter of those years  relate to the fiscal year ending in that year 
business segments we operate in three business segments industrial packaging services  paper  packaging services  and timber 
we are a leading global provider of industrial packaging products such as steel  fibre and plastic drums  intermediate bulk containers  closure systems for industrial packaging products and polycarbonate water bottles 
we seek to provide complete packaging solutions to our customers by offering a comprehensive range of products and services on a global basis 
we sell our products to customers in industries such as chemicals  paints and pigments  food and beverage  petroleum  industrial coatings  agricultural  pharmaceutical and mineral  among others 
we sell our containerboard  corrugated sheets and other corrugated products and multiwall bags to customers in north america in industries such as packaging  automotive  food and building products 
our corrugated container products are used to ship such diverse products as home appliances  small machinery  grocery products  building products  automotive components  books and furniture  as well as numerous other applications 
our full line of multiwall bag products is used to ship a wide range of industrial and consumer products  such as fertilizers  chemicals  concrete  flour  sugar  feed  seed  pet foods  popcorn  charcoal and salt  primarily for the agricultural  chemical  building products and food industries 
as of october   we owned approximately  acres of timberland in the southeastern united states  which is actively managed  and approximately  acres of timberland in canada 
our timber management is focused on the active harvesting and regeneration of our timber properties to achieve sustainable long term yields on our timberland 
while timber sales are subject to fluctuations  we seek to maintain a consistent cutting schedule  within the limits of market and weather conditions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  in accordance with these principles  require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our results of operations and financial condition 
the following are the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in addition  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on the length of time receivables are past due with allowance percentages  based on our historical experiences  applied on a graduated scale relative to the 
table of contents age of the receivable amounts 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected bad debt experience or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
inventory reserves 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
we continuously evaluate the adequacy of these reserves and make adjustments to these reserves as required 
net assets held for sale 
net assets held for sale represent land  buildings and land improvements less accumulated depreciation for locations that have been closed 
we record net assets held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is based on the estimated proceeds from the sale of the facility utilizing recent purchase offers  market comparables and or data obtained from our commercial real estate broker 
our estimate as to fair value is regularly reviewed and subject to changes in the commercial real estate markets and our continuing evaluation as to the facility s acceptable sale price 
properties  plants and equipment 
depreciation on properties  plants and equipment is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we own timber properties in the southeastern united states and in canada 
with respect to our united states timber properties  which consisted of approximately  acres at october   depletion expense is computed on the basis of cost and the estimated recoverable timber acquired 
our land costs are maintained by tract 
merchantable timber costs are maintained by five product classes  pine sawtimber  pine chip n saw  pine pulpwood  hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood  within a depletion block  with each depletion block based upon a geographic district or subdistrict 
currently  we have depletion blocks 
these same depletion blocks are used for pre merchantable timber costs 
each year  we estimate the volume of our merchantable timber for the five product classes by each depletion block 
these estimates are based on the current state in the growth cycle and not on quantities to be available in future years 
our estimates do not include costs to be incurred in the future 
we then project these volumes to the end of the year 
upon acquisition of a new timberland tract  we record separate amounts for land  merchantable timber and pre merchantable timber allocated as a percentage of the values being purchased 
these acquisition volumes and costs acquired during the year are added to the totals for each product class within the appropriate depletion block s 
the total of the beginning  one year growth and acquisition volumes are divided by the total undepleted historical cost to arrive at a depletion rate  which is then used for the current year 
as timber is sold  we multiply the volumes sold by the depletion rate for the current year to arrive at the depletion cost 
our canadian timberland  which consisted of approximately  acres at october   did not have any depletion expense since they are not actively managed at this time 
we believe that the lives and methods of determining depreciation and depletion are reasonable  however  using other lives and methods could provide materially different results 
restructuring reserves 
restructuring reserves are determined in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance  including sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
restructuring reserves are further discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
pension and postretirement benefits 
pension and postretirement benefit expenses are determined by our actuaries using assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and health care cost trend rates 
further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions is contained in notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the results would be different using other assumptions 

table of contents income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate as well as related interest 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
valuation allowances are established where expected future taxable income does not support the realization of the deferred tax assets 
environmental cleanup costs 
we expense environmental expenditures related to existing conditions caused by past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernable 
expenditures that extend the life of the related property  or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  are capitalized 
environmental expenses were insignificant in  million in and million in environmental cash expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our reserves for environmental liabilities at october  amounted to million  which included a reserve of million related to our facility in lier  belgium and million for asserted and unasserted environmental litigation  claims and or assessments at several manufacturing sites and other locations where we believe the outcome of such matters will be unfavorable to us 
the environmental exposures for those sites included in the million reserve were not individually significant 
the reserve for the lier  belgium site is based on environmental studies that have been conducted at this location 
the lier  belgium site is being monitored by the public flemish waste company pfwc  which is the belgian body for waste control 
pfwc must approve all remediation efforts that are undertaken by us at this site 
we anticipate that cash expenditures in future periods for remediation costs at identified sites will be made over an extended period of time 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures  actual costs may vary from those estimated at october  our exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material 
although environmental remediation could have a material effect on results of operations if a series of adverse developments occur in a particular quarter or fiscal year  we believe that the chance of a series of adverse developments occurring in the same quarter or fiscal year is remote 
future information and developments will require us to continually reassess the expected impact of these environmental matters 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain of the claims made under our employee medical and dental insurance programs 
we had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at october  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis and current payment trends 
we record an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period based upon historical information 
this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented 
if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month  the impact on earnings would be approximately million 
however  we believe the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 

table of contents we have certain deductibles applied to various insurance policies including general liability  product  auto and workers compensation 
deductible liabilities are insured through our captive insurance subsidiary  which had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to general liability  product  auto and workers compensation at october  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis  actuarial information and current payment trends 
contingencies 
various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us  including those pertaining to environmental  product liability  and safety and health matters 
we are continually consulting legal counsel and evaluating requirements to reserve for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
while the amounts claimed may be substantial  the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist 
based on the facts currently available  we believe the disposition of matters that are pending will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically reviewed for impairment as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the costs of acquired intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of two to years 
our policy is to periodically review other intangible assets subject to amortization and other long lived assets based upon the evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant adverse event or change in the environment in which the business operates  or if the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest would become less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets 
other items 
other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in item a under risk factors 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
results of operations historically  revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors

other income statement changes cost of products sold cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent in from percent in cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  primarily increased as a result of higher raw material costs  primarily steel and resin  that caused a basis point increase over the prior year 
lower absorption of fixed costs and timber segment sales  which have a lower cost than our other products  and higher energy costs also caused our cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  to increase 
these negative factors to our cost of products sold were partially mitigated by improved selling prices and efficiencies in labor and other manufacturing costs related to the greif business system see restructuring charges below 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses were million  or percent of net sales  in compared to million  or percent of net sales  in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  declined primarily as a result of the greif business system and our continued focus on controllable costs

the million decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments made to our suppliers 
long term debt has declined due to strong cash flows from operating activities  which benefited from the improvements in working capital from the transformation to the greif business system  and the monetization of the significant nonstrategic timberland sale partially offset by three separate acquisitions and the build up of cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents borrowing arrangements credit agreement as of march   we and certain of our international subsidiaries  as borrowers  entered into a million credit agreement the credit agreement see exhibit o with a syndicate of financial institutions  as lenders 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving multicurrency credit facility 
the revolving multicurrency credit facility is available for ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes 
interest is based on a euro currency rate or an alternative base rate that resets periodically plus a calculated margin amount 
on march   million was borrowed under the credit agreement in order to prepay the obligations outstanding under the prior credit agreement and certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with the credit agreement 
as of october   million was outstanding under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants  which include financial covenants that require us to maintain a certain leverage ratio and a minimum coverage of interest expense 
the leverage ratio generally requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of a our total consolidated indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents to b our consolidated net income plus depreciation  depletion and amortization  interest expense including capitalized interest  income taxes  and minus certain extraordinary gains and non recurring gains or plus certain extraordinary losses and non recurring losses for the preceding twelve months ebitda to be greater than to the interest coverage ratio generally requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of a our ebitda to b our interest expense including capitalized interest for the preceding twelve months to be less than to on october   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the terms of the credit agreement limit our ability to make restricted payments  which include dividends and purchases  redemptions and acquisitions of our equity interests 
the repayment of this facility is secured by a pledge of the capital stock of substantially all of our united states subsidiaries and  in part  by the capital stock of the international borrowers 
senior subordinated notes on july   we issued senior subordinated notes see exhibit a in the aggregate principal amount of million  receiving net proceeds of approximately million before expenses 
interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually at the annual rate of percent 
the senior subordinated notes do not have required principal payments prior to maturity on august  as of october   there was a total of million outstanding under the senior subordinated notes 
the decrease was primarily due to a million purchase of senior subordinated notes at a premium million  which was charged to interest expense  during the third quarter of the remaining difference was due to the recording of losses on fair value hedges we have in place to hedge interest rate risk 
the indenture pursuant to which the senior subordinated notes were issued contains certain covenants 
at october   we were in compliance with these covenants

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk related to our financial instruments that include borrowings under our credit agreement  senior secured credit agreement  proceeds from our senior subordinated notes and trade accounts receivable credit facility  and interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million as of october  and million as of october  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements have been entered into to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates and changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt 

table of contents the tables below provide information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the credit agreement  senior secured credit agreement  senior subordinated notes and trade accounts receivable credit facility  the tables present scheduled amortizations of principal and the weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity dates at october  and for interest rate swaps  the tables present annual amortizations of notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
under the cash flow swap agreements  we receive interest quarterly from the counterparties and pay interest quarterly to the counterparties 
under the fair value swap agreements  we receive interest semi annually from the counterparties and pay interest semi annually to the counterparties 
the fair values of the credit agreement  senior secured credit agreement  senior subordinated notes and trade accounts receivable credit facility are based on rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturity at october  and the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements has been determined based upon the market settlement prices of comparable contracts at october  and financial instruments as of october  dollars in millions expected maturity date after total fair value credit agreement scheduled amortizations average interest rate senior subordinated notes scheduled amortizations average interest rate trade accounts receivable credit facility scheduled amortizations average interest rate interest rate swaps scheduled amortizations average pay rate average receive rate variable rate specified is based on libor or an alternative base rate plus a calculated margin at october  the rates presented are not intended to project our expectations for the future

based on a sensitivity analysis performed by the counterparties at october   a basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the swap agreements by million resulting in a liability of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the swap agreements by million resulting in an asset of million 
foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the geographic presence of our operations mitigates this exposure to some degree 
additionally  our transaction exposure is somewhat limited because we produce and sell a majority of our products within each country in which we operate 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain short term intercompany loan balances among our international businesses 
at october  and  we had contracts outstanding of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of these contracts at october  and resulted in a loss of million in both years 
each of these contracts hedges the exposure of the euro against the fluctuation of various other currencies 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the euro against these other currencies indicates that if the euro uniformly weakened by percent against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million to a net loss of million 
conversely  if the euro uniformly strengthened by percent against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would increase by million to a net gain of million 
any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
commodity price risk our operating profit is potentially affected to a significant degree by fluctuations in the cost of our raw materials and energy see risk factors included in item a of this form k 
we do not have long term supply contracts or hedging arrangements in place for obtaining our principal raw materials 
in general  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices 
however  from time to time  we enter into short term contracts to hedge certain of our energy costs
