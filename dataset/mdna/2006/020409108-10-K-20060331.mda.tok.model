item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
on september   the company sold its adult day care adc business segment 
the adc segment information has been reclassified from continuing operations and into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company has taken steps to reorganize and strengthen the management team 
also  the company continually strives to enhance the information system and improve operational efficiency 
our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan emphasizes our visiting nurse operations 
our personal care operations will help us maintain a level of diversification of reimbursement risk that we believe is appropriate 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following o generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  o expand the significance of our visiting nurse  medicare based  home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers and through the startup of new agencies  and o expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 
based on our business plan  we expect our visiting nurse revenues to grow from just under one half of total revenues to about two thirds of total revenues sometime in the next three to five years 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition we recognize revenues when patient services are provided 
our receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by us to be their net realizable values 
the company is paid for its services primarily by federal and state third party reimbursement programs  commercial insurance companies  and patients 
revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered 
appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
it is common for issues to arise related to medical coding  particularly with respect to medicare  patient eligibility  particularly related to medicaid  and other reasons unrelated to credit risk  all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts 
management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term 
medicare revenue recognition on october   medicare began paying providers of home health care at fixed  predetermined rates for services and supplies bundled into day episodes of home health care 
an episode of home health care spans a day period  starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished to a medicare beneficiary and ending days later 
if a patient is still in treatment on the th day a new episode begins on the st day regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends days later 
the first day of a consecutive episode  therefore  is not necessarily the new episode s first billable visit 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below base episode period payment october  through september   october  through march   april  through december   january  through december   the actual episode payment rates  as presented in the table vary  depending on the home health resource groups hhrgs to which medicare patients are assigned and the per episode payment is typically reduced or increased by such factors as the patient s clinical  functional  and services utilization characteristics 
under the prospective payment system pps for medicare reimbursement  net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate that varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and other factors 
net revenues are recorded as services are rendered to patients over the day episode period 
at the end of each month  a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes in progress 
medicare reimbursement  on an episodic basis  is subject to adjustment if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we recognize medicare revenue on an episode by episode basis during the course of that episode over its expected number of visits 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
we calculate our reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience 
insurance programs we bear significant insurance risk under our large deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self insured employee health program 
under our workers compensation insurance program  we bear risk up to  per incident 
we purchase stop loss insurance for our employee health plan that places a specific limit  generally  on our exposure for any individual covered life 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however  our deductible per claim increased effective july   from  to  we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate 
as part of our on going risk management and cost control efforts  we continually seek alternatives that might provide a different balance of cost and risk  including potentially accepting additional self insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas no 
as of december   we completed our quarterly impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
depending on level of sales  our liquidity and other factors  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
accounting for income taxes as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of approximately  the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately  of current deferred tax assets and approximately  of long term deferred tax assets 
we have provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon our estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation was based in large part on our history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
we have considered the above factors in reaching our conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  however  there can be no assurances that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
during the years ended december  and  based on changes in facts and circumstances  favorable changes occurred in the company s expectations with regard to the generation of future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
accordingly  the state and local tax provision for   and included a reduction of previously recorded valuation allowances of approximately   and  respectively 
seasonality our visiting nurse segment operations located in florida normally experience higher admissions during the march quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations 
acquisitions over the next three to five years we will actively seek to acquire quality providers of medicare certified home health services like our current visiting nurse segment operations 
we may consider acquisitions of businesses that provide health care services similar to those we currently offer in our personal care segment but we expect most of our acquisition activity to be focused on visiting nurse operations 
factors which may affect future acquisition decisions include the quality and potential profitability of the business under consideration  and our profitability and ability to finance the transaction 
during  we acquired three visiting nurse operations one of which was essentially a startup operation 
these operations added to our market presence in florida 
on april  we acquired all the assets and business operations of a medicare certified visiting nurse agency located in bradenton  florida 
the total purchase price of million was paid in the form of million in cash at closing with the  balance in the form of a note payable bearing interest at payable quarterly and the note balance due in two years after closing 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price with available borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
on november  we acquired all the assets and business operations of a medicare certified visiting nurse agency located in st 
augustine  florida 
the total purchase price of  was paid in the form of  in cash at closing with the balance in the form of a note payable bearing interest at due in its entirety three years after closing 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price with cash on hand

vn revenue growth was driven by admissions growth and acquisitions 
new vn operations started in late and early generated approximately million in revenue and operating losses of  in the twelve months ended december  acquired operations added approximately million in revenues and about  in operating income 
pc revenue and operating income increased due to increased volumes 
ebitda increased between periods primarily due to revenue increases 
corporate expenses increased due to increased incentive provisions partially offset by a decrease in professional fees related to a union defense related to one of our personal care locations 
as a result of the settlement of the franklin litigation  a gain of  was recognized in excluding this non taxable litigation gain  the effective continuing operations income tax rate was approximately and of income before income taxes in and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for continuing operations in resulted primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance of  of pretax income related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
visiting nurse segment year ended december  and approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
in addition to our focus on operating income from the visiting nurse segment  we also measure this segment s performance in terms of admissions  patient months of care  revenue per patient month and cost of services per patient month

excluding these start up and acquisition operations  operating income grew as a percentage of revenue 
admissions grew about over the prior year while patient months increased  reflecting a small reduction in the average length of stay 
revenue per patient month increased primarily due to higher medicare rates between periods 
operating costs per patient month increased approximately primarily due to start up operations and higher wage rates and employee benefits related to the direct provision of service 
general and administrative expenses increased primarly as a result of a increase in units of operation between and personal care pc segment year ended december  and approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients

cost of services grew at a slower rate due to improved management of direct margins and and changes in payor and service mix 
general and administrative salaries and benefits were relatively unchanged while the general and administrative expenses decreased primarily die to lower bad debt losses from improved billing and collection efforts

vn revenue growth was driven by admissions growth as we continue to focus on this segment 
ebitda increased between periods primarily as a result of increased revenues 
vn operating income grew on the increases in admissions and revenues 
pc operating income declined due to shifts in the mix of our business and increased general and administrative costs  primarily increased provision for uncollectible accounts refer to the discussion of each segment below 
the litigation loss in resulted from the loss at the trial court level of the franklin litigation disclosed previously

operating costs per patient month decreased approximately 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of a increase in units of operation between and in march  the company received medicare certification for a new start up agency in melbourne fl

these operations contributed revenues of approximately million and operating income of approximately  in the year ended december in the quarter ended december   the company purchased a startup agency in orlando  florida and started medicare operations in cleveland  akron and youngstown  ohio

revenue per billable hour decreased from prior year primarily due to changes in mix 
certain of our pc markets experienced inordinate declines in volumes  while others experienced volume growth 
significant volume declines in two particular markets were more than offset by volume growth in certain other lower margin markets 
these changes in our business resulted in aggregate cost of services growing faster than aggregate revenues 
general administrative g a salaries and benefits increased in total and as a percentage of revenues due to our management reorganization which added staff to the pc management team 
our provision for uncollectible accounts in pc in the year ended december  increased by  over the prior year primarily due to an increasing difficulty in the collection of accounts from certain state medicaid programs 
liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility 
the company has a million credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na  as amended on august   with an expiration date of september  the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  currently dependent upon total leverage and is secured by substantially all assets and the stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the weighted average interest rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company pays a commitment fee of per annum on the unused facility balance 
borrowings are available equal to the greater of a a multiple of four times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined ebitda or b an asset based formula  primarily based on accounts receivable 
as defined ebitda of acquired operations  up to of base as defined ebitda  may be included in the availability calculations 
borrowings under the facility may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development and growth of the business and other corporate purposes 
as of december   the formula permitted approximately million to be used 
the company has irrevocable letters of credit  totaling million outstanding in connection with its self insurance programs 
thus  a total of million was available for use at december  the company s revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the covenants 
under the most restrictive of its covenants  the company is required to maintain minimum net worth of at least million 
the company believes that this facility will be sufficient to fund its operating needs for at least the next year 
the company will continue to evaluate additional capital  including possible debt and equity investments in the company  to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds 
cash flows key elements to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  net change in cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    discontinued operations activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable days revenues outstanding were at december   and at december   due to improved collection efforts and to a lesser degree changes in payor mix 
the increase in combined accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from an increase in insurance liabilities  accrued accounts payable and accrued taxes 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from the acquisition of home health agencies 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from the payoff of our credit facility from the adc divesture and other principal reductions of our debt obligations 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
most of the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from cost report settlements 
days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from the timing of payments 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from repayments on our credit facility and payment of capital lease and debt obligations 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities resulted principally from our current period income  net of changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
substantially all the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from medicare cost report settlements 
days sales outstanding were approximately and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from a lower liability under our self insured employee health program 
this lower liability resulted from a an intentional acceleration of the claims payment process and b lower employee participation due to an increase in required employee contributions 
the decrease in other assets and liabilities is principally the result of the discontinuation and payout of the deferred compensation plan 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from improvements in our information systems and a cash bond of million posted in a litigation appeal  partially offset by cash received from sale of assets 
net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from repayments on our credit facility and payment of capital lease and debt obligations 
contractual obligations 
the following table provides information about the payment dates of our contractual obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt amounts in thousands thereafter total revolving credit facility capital lease obligations notes payable operating leases     total     we believe that a certain amount of debt has an appropriate place in our overall capital structure and it is not our strategy to eliminate all debt financing 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility will be sufficient to cover operating needs  future capital expenditure requirements and scheduled debt payments of miscellaneous small borrowing arrangements and capitalized leases 
in addition  it is likely that we will pursue growth from acquisitions  partnerships and other ventures that would be funded from excess cash from operations  credit available under the bank credit agreement and other financing arrangements that are normally available in the marketplace 
commitments and contingencies letters of credit 
we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december   which benefit our third party insurer administrators for our self insurance programs 
the amount of such insurance program letter of credit is subject to negotiation annually upon renewal and may vary in the future based upon such negotiation  our historical claims experience and expected future claims 
it is reasonable to expect that the amount of the letter of credit will increase in the future  however  we are unable to predict to what degree 
we currently have no obligations related to acquisition agreements 
however  we periodically seek acquisition candidates and may reasonably be expected to enter into acquisitions in the future 
general and professional liability 
malpractice and general patient liability claims for incidents which may give rise to litigation have been asserted against us by various claimants 
the claims are in various stages of processing and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
we also know of incidents that have occurred through december  that may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry insurance coverage for this exposure  however our deductible per claim increased effective july   from  to we record estimated liabilities for our insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we monitor our estimated insurance related liabilities on a monthly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
medicaid dependence we have a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately      and of our revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of ohio  kentucky  connecticut  massachusetts  florida  indiana and alabama  respectively 
approximately of our revenues were derived from state medicaid and other government programs  most of which are currently facing significant budget issues 
the medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate are taking actions or evaluating taking actions to control the rate of growth of medicaid expenditures 
among these actions are the following o redefining eligibility standards for medicaid coverage o redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services o slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made o limiting reimbursement rate increases o changing regulations under which providers must operate the actions being taken and or being considered are because the number of medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the government s revenue 
medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of the budget 
this issue is exacerbated when revenues slow in a slowing economy 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states medicaid financing problems 
it is possible  however  that the actions taken by the state medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact our reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as us 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
we cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting our business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether we will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in our existing or future markets 
refer to the sections on reimbursement changes and risk factors in part i  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa was enacted by the federal government on august   and requires organizations to adhere to certain standards to protect data integrity  confidentiality and availability 
hipaa also mandates  among other things  that the department of health and human services adopt standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care industry 
we implemented changes in our operations to comply with the privacy aspects of hipaa and we believe we are in compliance 
we do not expect the cost of complying with privacy standards to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we implemented changes in our operations to comply with the electronic transaction and code sets aspects of hipaa and we believe we are in compliance with those requirements 
independent of hipaa requirements  we have been developing new information systems with improved functionality to facilitate improved billing and collection activities  reduced administrative costs and improved decision support information 
we have incorporated the hipaa mandated electronic transaction and code sets into the design of this new software 
regulations with regard to the security components of hipaa were published in those regulations were required to be implemented by april we believe we are in compliance with the security regulations  with no material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
discontinued operations we follow the guidance in sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  when appropriate  reclassify operating units closed  sold  or held for sale out of continuing operations and into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
as a result of the sale of the adc segment  it has been reclassified in our financial statements as further explained in the notes to the financial statements 
revenues from the discontinued adc segment were approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and respectively 
net losses from the discontinued adc segment were approximately   and  in the years ended december   and respectively  and such amounts are included in net loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
in the three years ended december   no operating units in the vn or pc segments met the criteria to be reclassified as discontinued operations 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
non gaap financial measure the information provided in the some of the tables use certain non gaap financial measures as defined under securities and exchange commission sec rules 
in accordance with sec rules  the company has provided  in the supplemental information and the footnotes to the tables  a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
ebitda ebitda is defined as income before depreciation and amortization  net interest expense and income taxes 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance and liquidity 
management routinely calculates and communicates ebitda and believes that it is useful to investors because it is commonly used as an analytical indicator within our industry to evaluate performance  measure leverage capacity and debt service ability  and to estimate current or prospective enterprise value 
ebitda is also used in measurements of borrowing availability and certain covenants contained in our credit agreement 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of continuing operations net income as adjusted to ebitda year ended december  net income from continuing operations    add back interest expense    income taxes    depreciation and amortization    earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we do not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would have no material effect
