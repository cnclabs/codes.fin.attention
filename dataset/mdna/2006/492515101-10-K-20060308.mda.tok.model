item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
employees as of february   we have full and part time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties 
if any of the following occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed 
these factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history and have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the future and may never become profitable 
we have a limited operating history 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies 
in addition  we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
as we expand our research and development efforts  we will incur increasing losses 
we may continue to incur substantial operating losses even if we begin to generate revenues from our drug candidates or technologies 
we have not yet commercialized any products or technologies and cannot be sure we will ever be able to do so 
even if we commercialize one or more of our drug candidates or technologies  we may not become profitable 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on a number of factors  including our ability to complete our development efforts  obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates  successfully complete any post approval regulatory obligations and successfully commercialize our drug candidates and technologies 
risks associated with our product development efforts if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trial programs  or if such clinical trials take longer to complete than we project  our ability to execute our current business strategy will be adversely affected 
whether or not and how quickly we complete clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate at which we are able to engage clinical trial sites and  thereafter  the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competitive clinical trials  and whether existing or new drugs are approved for the indication we are studying 
we are aware that other companies are planning clinical trials that will seek to enroll patients with the same diseases as we are studying 
in addition  one of our current trials for sulonex is designed to continue until a pre determined number of events have occurred to the patients enrolled 
trials such as this are subject to delays stemming from patient withdrawal and from lower than expected event rates and may also incur increased costs if enrollment is increased in order to achieve the desired number of events 
if we experience delays in identifying and contracting with sites and or in patient enrollment in our clinical trial programs  we may incur additional costs and delays in our development programs  and may not be able to complete our clinical trials on a cost effective or timely basis 
additionally  we have finalized an spa agreement with the fda for the phase iii and phase iv clinical trials of sulonex 
the clinical plan to support an nda approval for sulonex under subpart h  as agreed upon with the fda under an spa  consists of i a single phase iii trial in patients with microalbuminuria based on the surrogate marker of regression of microalbuminuria as the primary endpoint  ii supportive data from previously conducted clinical studies  and iii substantial recruitment into our phase iv confirmatory study that will measure clinical outcomes in patients with overt nephropathy  or macroalbuminuria 
the subpart h process is complex and requires careful execution 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to meet the requirements set forth in the spa 
even if we meet those requirements  the fda is not obligated to grant approval of our nda for sulonex 
if the fda approves sulonex for marketing on the basis of our phase iii trial  our phase iv clinical trial may yield insufficient efficacy data or give rise to safety concerns  which could result in withdrawal of such approval or could cause us to withdraw the product from the market 
many companies who have been granted the right to utilize an accelerated approval approach have failed to obtain approval 
moreover  negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we hope to conduct or adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials 
accordingly  we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame  if at all 
if our drug candidates do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals  we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates 
we have not received  and may never receive  regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our drug candidates 
we will need to conduct significant additional research and human testing before we can apply for product approval with the fda or with regulatory authorities of other countries 
pre clinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically depends on the nature  complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical tests can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
it may take us many years to complete the testing of our drug candidates and failure can occur at any stage of this process 
negative or inconclusive results or medical events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts 
furthermore  interim results of preclinical or clinical studies do not necessarily predict their final results  and acceptable results in early studies might not be obtained in later studies 
drug candidates in the later stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite positive results in initial clinical testing 
there can be no assurance that the results from the phase iii study will track the data from the phase ii study  or that the results from the phase iv study will yield sufficient efficacy data 
with respect to sulonex  the recommendation to move into our pivotal program  as well as the announced phase ii data  may not be indicative of results from future clinical trials and the risk remains that the pivotal program for sulonex may generate efficacy data that will be insufficient for the approval of the drug  or may raise safety concerns that may prevent approval of the drug 
clinical trials also have a high risk of failure 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
if we experience delays in the testing or approval process or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than originally planned  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates may be materially impaired 
in addition  we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval in the united states and abroad and  accordingly  may encounter unforeseen problems and delays in the approval process 
because all of our proprietary technologies are licensed to us by third parties  termination of these license agreements would prevent us from developing our drug candidates 
we do not own any of our drug candidates 
we have licensed the patent rights to these drugs candidates from others 
these license agreements require us to meet development or financing milestones and impose development and commercialization due diligence requirements on us 
in addition  under these agreements  we must pay royalties on sales of products resulting from licensed technologies and pay the patent filing  prosecution and maintenance costs related to the licenses 
if we do not meet our obligations in a timely manner or if we otherwise breach the terms of our license agreements  our licensors could terminate the agreements  and we would lose the rights to our drug candidates 
we rely on third parties to manufacture our products 
if these third parties do not successfully manufacture our products  our business will be harmed 
we have no experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes and do not have any manufacturing facilities 
we intend to continue  in whole or in part  to use third parties to manufacture our products for use in clinical trials and for future sales 
we may not be able to enter into future third party contract manufacturing agreements on acceptable terms to us  if at all 
contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  shortage of qualified personnel  compliance with fda and foreign regulations  production costs and development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
our third party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required by us to successfully produce and market our drug candidates 
in addition  our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic  unannounced inspections by the fda and corresponding foreign governmental agencies to ensure strict compliance with  among other things  current good manufacturing practices  in addition to other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we will not have control over  other than by contract  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
switching or engaging multiple manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and  particularly in the case of sulonex  the process by which multiple manufacturers make the drug substance must be identical at each manufacturing facility 
it may be difficult for us to find and engage replacement or multiple manufacturers quickly and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
moreover  if we need to change manufacturers  the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturers in advance  which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with fda and foreign regulations and standards 
if third party manufacturers fail to deliver the required quantities of our drug candidates on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices  we will not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
we have entered into a relationship with a us based contract manufacturer for sulonex which we believe will be adequate to satisfy our current clinical supply needs  however  as we scale up for commercial manufacturing  we will need to ensure that we accurately reproduce the established process on a larger scale 
as with all heparin like compounds  the end product is highly sensitive to the manufacturing process utilized 
accordingly  as we scale up  reproducibility will be required for the successful commercialization of sulonex 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor 
additionally  as we scale up  we will incur capital expenditures to enable larger scale production 
if we are not able to obtain the raw materials required for the manufacture of our lead product candidate  sulonex  our ability to develop and market this product candidate will be substantially harmed 
source materials for sulonex  our lead product candidate  are derived from porcine mucosa 
long term supplies for sulonex could be affected by limitations in the supply of porcine mucosa and the demand for other heparin products  over which we will have no control 
additionally  diseases affecting the world supply of pigs could have an actual or perceived negative impact on our ability  or the ability of our contract manufacturers  to source  make and or sell sulonex 
such negative impact could materially affect the commercial success of sulonex 
if we do not establish or maintain manufacturing  drug development and marketing arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to commercialize our products 
we are an emerging company and do not possess all of the capabilities to fully commercialize our products on our own 
from time to time  we may need to contract with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  assist us in developing  testing and obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing some of our compounds and technologies  and market and distribute our drug products 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into agreements with such third parties on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully contract with third parties for these services when needed  or if existing arrangements for these services are terminated  whether or not through our actions  or if such third parties do not fully perform under these arrangements  we may have to delay  scale back or end one or more of our drug development programs or seek to develop or commercialize our products independently  which could result in delays 
furthermore  such failure could result in the termination of license rights to one or more of our products 
if these manufacturing  development or marketing agreements take the form of a partnership or strategic alliance  such arrangements may provide our collaborators with significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the development and commercialization of our products 
accordingly  to the extent that we rely on third parties to research  develop or commercialize our products  we are unable to control whether such products will be scientifically or commercially successful 
our reliance on third parties  such as clinical research organizations  or cros  may result in delays in completing  or a failure to complete  clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them 
in the course of product development  we engage cros to conduct and manage clinical studies and to assist us in guiding our products through the fda review and approval process 
because we have engaged and intend to continue to engage cros to help us obtain market approval for our drug candidates  many important aspects of this process have been and will be out of our direct control 
if the cros fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner  we may face delays in completing our clinical trials  as well as commercialization of one or more drug candidates 
furthermore  any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials and the market approval of drug candidates 
other risks related to our business if we are unable to develop adequate sales  marketing or distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform some of these functions  we will not be able to commercialize our products effectively 
in the event sulonex is approved by the fda  we currently plan to conduct our own sales and marketing effort to support the drug  and we may adopt this strategy with respect to future drug products 
we currently have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
to directly market and distribute any products  we must build a sales and marketing organization with appropriate technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may attempt to build such a sales and marketing organization on our own or with the assistance of a contract sales organization 
for some market opportunities  we may need to enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms in order to increase the commercial success of our products 
we may not be able to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities of our own or enter into such arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products  and some or all of the revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  and these efforts may not be successful 
additionally  building marketing and distribution capabilities may be more expensive than we anticipate  requiring us to divert capital from other intended purposes or preventing us from building our marketing and distribution capabilities to the desired levels 
even if we obtain fda approval to market our drug products  if they fail to achieve market acceptance  we will never record meaningful revenues 
even if our products are approved for sale  they may not be commercially successful in the marketplace 
market acceptance of our drug products will depend on a number of factors  including perceptions by members of the health care community  including physicians  of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  the rates of adoption of our products by medical practitioners and the target populations for our products  the potential advantages that our products offer over existing treatment methods  the cost effectiveness of our products relative to competing products  the availability of government or third party payor reimbursement for our products  the side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or similar products  and the effectiveness of our sales  marketing and distribution efforts 
because we expect sales of our products  if approved  to generate substantially all of our revenues in the long term  the failure of our drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing or other sources of revenue 
if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug products  our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as universities and public and private research institutions 
in addition  companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us 
many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development  regulation  manufacturing and marketing than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel  attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations  and license technologies that are competitive with ours 
as a result  our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that could render our drug products obsolete or noncompetitive 
to compete successfully in this industry we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors 
the drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies 
in addition  our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug products 
other companies have drug candidates in various stages of pre clinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to discover and develop drug products 
some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized earlier 
even if we are successful in developing effective drugs  our products may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our operations could be disrupted and our business could be harmed 
as of february   we had full and part time employees 
to successfully develop our drug candidates  we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  if we lose the services of our current personnel  in particular  michael s 
weiss  our chairman and chief executive officer  our ability to continue to execute on our business plan could be materially impaired 
in addition  although we have an employment agreement with mr 
weiss  this agreement does not prevent him from terminating his employment with us 
any acquisitions we make may require a significant amount of our available cash and may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
as part of our business strategy  we may effect acquisitions to obtain additional businesses  products  technologies  capabilities and personnel 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash  we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
acquisitions involve a number of operational risks  including difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired business  our inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of the acquired business  our inability to maintain the acquired company s relationship with key third parties  such as alliance partners  exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition  the diversion of our management s attention from our core business  and the potential impairment of goodwill and write off of in process research and development costs  adversely affecting our reported results of operations 
the status of reimbursement from third party payors for newly approved health care drugs is uncertain and failure to obtain adequate reimbursement could limit our ability to generate revenue 
our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities  private health insurers  managed care programs  and other third party payors 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
third party payors  including medicare  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing  in some cases  to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted labeling approval 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for our products 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  their market acceptance may be reduced 
health care reform measures could adversely affect our business 
the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system  such as those relating to reimportation of drugs into the us from other countries where they are sold at a lower price and government control of prescription drug pricing 
the pendency or approval of such proposals could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic partnerships or licenses 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the use of our drug candidates in clinical trials  and the future sale of any approved products  exposes us to liability claims 
although we are not aware of any historical or anticipated product liability claims against us  if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to cease clinical trials of our drug candidates or limit commercialization of any approved products 
we believe that we have obtained sufficient product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the commercial sale of any approved products if marketing approval is obtained  however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost 
we may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage that will be adequate to cover product liability risks that may arise 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product  injury to our reputation  our inability to continue to develop a drug candidate  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  and loss of revenues 
consequently  a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material 
in connection with providing our clinical trial management and site recruitment services  we may be exposed to liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the online collaborative oncology group  inc  or ocog  a subsidiary we acquired through our acquisition of access oncology  provides clinical trial management and site recruitment services to us as well as other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
in conducting the activities of ocog  any failure on our part to comply with applicable governmental regulations or contractual obligations could expose us to liability to our clients and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform 
in addition  the wrongful or erroneous delivery of health care information or services may expose us to liability 
if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any such claims  the losses could be material 
our corporate compliance efforts cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
the development  manufacturing  pricing  sales  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and other authorities within the united states and numerous entities outside of the united states 
we are a relatively small company with employees 
we also have significantly fewer employees than many other companies that have a product candidate in late stage clinical development  and we rely heavily on third parties to conduct many important functions 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices  we cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  including suspension or termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of products from the market  significant fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
risks related to our financial condition our current cash  cash equivalents and investment securities may not be adequate to support our operations for the next months as we have estimated 
we believe that our million in cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable and investment securities as of december  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our forecast of the period of time through which our cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable and investment securities will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following the timing of expenses associated with manufacturing and product development of the proprietary drug candidates within our portfolio and those that may be in licensed  partnered or acquired  the timing of the in licensing  partnering and acquisition of new product opportunities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered  or may enter  into research and development agreements  our ability to achieve our milestones under our licensing arrangements  and the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds on terms favorable to us  or at all  our business would be harmed 
we expect to use  rather than generate  funds from operations for the foreseeable future 
based on our current plans  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  interest receivable and investment securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next months  however  the actual amount of funds that we will need prior to or after that date will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we may need funds sooner or in different amounts than we currently anticipate  depending upon the progress of our development activities  the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our development programs  the costs associated with commercialization activities  including manufacturing  marketing and sales  our ability to establish and maintain current and new licensing or acquisition arrangements  our ability to achieve our milestones under our licensing arrangements  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of regulatory approvals 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all  we may be required to cease or reduce our operating activities or sell or license to third parties some or all of our intellectual property 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted 
if we need to raise additional funds through the sale or license of our intellectual property  we may be unable to do so on terms favorable to us 
our prior restructurings may result in additional israeli related liabilities 
in july  our israeli subsidiary vacated its jerusalem facility  after giving advance notice to the landlord 
on may   the landlord of the jerusalem facility filed suit in israel claiming that we were liable as a result of the alleged breach of the lease agreement by our subsidiary 
the amount demanded by the landlord totals  nis or approximately  at the december  exchange rate  and includes rent for the entire remaining term of the lease  as well as property taxes and other costs allegedly incurred by the landlord 
in august  the landlord claimed a bank deposit  in the amount of  which was previously provided as security in connection with the lease agreement 
we intend to vigorously defend the suit 
in july  keryx israel ltd 
and keryx biomedical technologies ltd 
filed an answer to the landlord s complaint 
in october  keryx biopharmaceuticals  inc filed an answer to the landlord s complaint 
generally  each answer challenges the merits of the landlord s cause of action as to each defendant 
all defendants  except keryx israel ltd  have also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
the plaintiff has filed a response to each answer and a hearing date has been set by the circuit court of jerusalem 
to date  we have not yet recorded a charge to reflect any potential liability associated with this lawsuit as it is too early to accurately estimate the amount of the charge  if any 
in september  one of our israeli subsidiaries received the status of an approved enterprise  a status which grants certain tax benefits in israel in accordance with the law for the encouragement of capital investments  through december   our israeli subsidiary  which ceased operations in  has received tax benefits in the form of exemptions of approximately  as a result of our subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise 
as part of the restructuring implemented during  we closed down our jerusalem laboratory facility 
in october  the subsidiary received a letter from the israeli ministry of industry and trade that its approved enterprise status was cancelled as of july and that past benefits would not need to be repaid 
the israeli tax authorities have yet to confirm this position  however  we believe that  based on the letter received from the ministry of industry and trade  it is unlikely that past benefits will need to be repaid  and therefore  we have not recorded any charge with respect to this potential liability 
there can be no assurances that the israeli tax authorities will confirm this position 
as a result  we may be liable to repay some or all of the tax benefits received to date  which could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  third parties may be able to use our intellectual property  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection on our drug products and technologies and successfully defend these patents against third party challenges 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date 
accordingly  the patents we use may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative drug products or technologies or design around our patented drug products and technologies 
the patents we use may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we rely on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we require our employees  collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements  this may not be sufficient to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
in addition  we share ownership and publication rights to data relating to some of our drug products and technologies with our research collaborators and scientific advisors 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of this information  our ability to receive patent protection or protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information will be at risk 
litigation or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money defending such claims and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
third parties may assert that we are using their proprietary intellectual property without authorization 
in addition  third parties may have or obtain patents in the future and claim that our drug products or technologies infringe their patents 
if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties  or if we sue third parties to protect our patent rights  we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs  and our management s attention may be diverted from operating our business 
in addition  any legal action against our licensors or us that seeks damages or an injunction of our commercial activities relating to the affected our drug products or technologies could subject us to monetary liability and require our licensors or us to obtain a license to continue to use the affected our drug products or technologies 
we cannot predict whether our licensors or we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
risks related to our common stock concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
as of december   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders including their affiliates beneficially owned  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock  including  for this purpose  currently exercisable options and warrants held by our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders 
as a result  these persons  acting together  may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  such persons  acting together  may have the ability to effectively control our management and affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may depress the market price of our common stock 
future sales or other issuances of our common stock could depress the market for our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception by the market that those sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future 
on december   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s  that was declared effective by the sec on january   providing for the offering of up to million of our common stock 
future sales pursuant to this registration statement could depress the market for our common stock 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes stock or other securities  your equity in us may be significantly diluted 
we may be required to issue up to  shares of our common stock to former stockholders of access oncology upon the achievement of certain milestones 
in addition  we may enter into arrangements with third parties permitting us to issue shares of common stock in lieu of certain cash payments upon the achievement of milestones 
as of december   our executive officers  directors  and principal stockholders beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our common stock  including currently exercisable warrants and options held by them 
if some or all of them should decide to sell a substantial number of their holdings  it could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock 
our stock price can be volatile  which increases the risk of litigation  and may result in a significant decline in the value of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include developments concerning our drug candidates  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  introductions or announcements of new products by us or our competitors  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  expiration or termination of licenses  research contracts or other collaboration agreements  conditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  and additions or departures of key personnel 
in addition  equity markets in general  and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets 
these broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our development and operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
certain anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
this could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  or control us 
these factors could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of such holders 
in certain circumstances  such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock 
our amended and restated bylaws eliminate the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
any of these provisions could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control
