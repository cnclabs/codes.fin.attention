we believe that our facilities  in general  are adequate for our present needs 
we do not expect that  if the need arises  we would experience difficulties in obtaining additional space at favorable rates 
item legal proceedings 
legal proceedings as more fully discussed below  from time to time we may be involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings relating to contractual disputes  securities law  intellectual property law  and employment law 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation matters  we are unable to predict the liability that could finally result from a range of possible unfavorable outcomes 
we have reserved the estimated amount that we reasonably expect to pay for the cases discussed 
however  our estimate could be wrong  and we could pay more or less than our current accrual 
litigation can be costly  diverting management s attention and could  upon resolution  have a

vutek  inc 
on may   leggett platt  inc  or l p  and its patent holding subsidiary brought a patent infringement action against vutek  a company acquired by us in june  in the united states district court in the eastern district of missouri 
we believe that the l p infringement claims are demonstrably false  and we will vigorously seek summary adjudication of non infringement against l p s claims 
on june   we answered l p s complaint and counter claimed  asking the court to find that l p had no objective or subjective basis for bringing the action and that the asserted patent is invalid and not infringed

all amounts in this section are presented in thousands  except for per share amounts 
overview key financial results for were as follows our consolidated revenues increased by approximately from to  this was the result of the addition of the vutek product line 
those increases were partially offset by slight decreases in revenue from our professional printing applications and controllers 
the vutek acquisition added approximately  to our operating income before charges for in process research and development and the amortization of the vutek acquired intangibles 
the addition of the vutek product line in and our software acquisitions in have helped us achieve the goal of decreased reliance on oem sales 
in our non oem sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we saw our non oem sales increase to 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  which are the basis of the following discussion and analysis  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition and contingencies 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the following are believed to be our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances and other allowances  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  business combinations and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions  and inkjet printers and ink  software and royalties 
we also receive services and support revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support and training and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab and  if applicable  emerging issues task force revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf for the sale of controllers  printers  and ink 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use either a purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
delivery for hardware generally occurs when product is delivered to the customer s common carrier 
in some instances  we also sell products where the terms included in sales arrangements result in different timing for revenue recognition  assuming all other recognition criteria are met a if title and risk of loss is transferred at the customer s destination cip destination  revenue is recognized when the product s arrives at the customer site  and b if title is retained after product delivery until payment is received  revenue is recognized at the time when passage of title occurs upon payment receipt 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and if applicable  sab and eitf to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and to the software license portion of the agreements using the residual method 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of our professional services based on the rates charged to our customers in 
table of contents stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe of fair value for post contract customer support based on substantative renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognized when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract typically one to two years  assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we also have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize revenue from the subscriptions ratably over the service period 
any upfront setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances and other allowances and accruals 
to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
to do so  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of  as of december  similarly  management must make estimates of potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to measure the need for inventory allowances 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand and the acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventory balance was  net of allowance of  as of december  we accrue for estimated legal expenses  including potential regulatory fines when the likelihood of the incurrence of the related costs is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs 
until both of these conditions are met  the related legal expenses are recorded as incurred 
the material assumptions we use to estimate the amount of legal expenses include the monthly legal expense incurred by our external attorneys on the particular case being evaluated  communication between our external attorneys and us on the expected duration of the lawsuit and the estimated expenses during that time  our strategy regarding the lawsuit  the deductible amounts under the insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 
the outcome of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted  and if the outcome is different than expected  our income could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively 
we have from time to time set up allowances or accruals for uncertainties related to revenues and for potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
management bases its estimates for the allowances or accruals on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax expense and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our 
table of contents consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have maintained a valuation allowance of  as of december  for foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
we completed our annual review in the third quarter of  based upon july  balances  with no impairment of goodwill indicated as a result of the review 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets amounted to  as of december  no adjustments to the lives of the other intangible assets have been made since the adoption of sfas business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of intangible assets acquired 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption  estimates or other actual results 

table of contents other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs of vacating duplicate facilities 
these costs are based upon estimates made by management and are subject to refinement 
to estimate these costs  we utilize assumptions of the number of employees that will involuntarily terminate employment and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  approximately of our total assets and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  based on our assessment of the factors discussed below  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our japanese subsidiary  efi kk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency and our german subsidiary  efi germany gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of income or as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in stockholders equity 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of income 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our consolidated statement of income 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of income 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth items in our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenue for  and and the year to year percentage change from over and from over  respectively

the first category  controllers  is primarily made up of stand alone servers  which connect digital copiers with computer networks  and embedded desktop controllers  bundled solutions and design licensed solutions primarily for the office market and commercial printing 
this category includes our fiery  splash  edox  and micropress color and black and white controller products 
the second category  inkjet products  consists of sales of the super wide format inkjet printers and inks  and parts and services revenue from the newly acquired vutek business 
the third category  professional printing applications  or ppa  consists of software technology focused on printing workflow  print management information systems  proofing and web submission and job tracking tools 
the fourth category of miscellaneous revenue consists of spares  scanning solutions  and field dispatching solutions 
we previously considered the stand alone servers and the embedded products each as separate categories 

table of contents the following is a break down of revenue by category in dollars 
change years ended december  over over revenue controllers inkjet products professional printing applications miscellaneous total revenue revenue was  in  compared to  in and  in  which resulted in a increase in versus and an increase in compared to the major factor contributing to the overall higher revenue in over was a  increase attributable to the vutek acquisition  offsetting a decrease in controller sales of in our controller category  the decrease in over of  was due to a reduction in volumes  partially offset by a increase in the average selling price 
in the second half of a number of new server and embedded controllers products were launched by our oem customers and total controller revenue has increased by over the second half of  while unit volume has increased by for the same period 
our high end servers showed a increase in the average selling price  while the average selling price of our low end and black and white servers were stable 
for embedded controllers  the average selling price has increased by in as the product mix moved from chipsets  which typically sell for a lower unit price but carry a higher margin  to the higher priced  board based products 
we anticipate that in the mix will move back to more chipsets and fewer board based products 
revenue in the inkjet products category represents seven months of vutek operations 
on a pro forma basis  combining the pre acquisition revenue of  with post acquisition revenue would result in annual revenues of  approximately of the inkjet product revenues since our acquisition were generated from sales of inks 
the professional printing applications experienced a modest increase of in over within this category are the products we acquired from printcafe and best gmbh as well as certain software products that were developed by efi to enhance our server products  such as our graphic arts package and products to optimize the workflow in printshops such as oneflow and balance 
the software applications in this category generate higher margins  favorably impacting our margins 
we continue to see strong market acceptance of these products and we believe we will experience further incremental growth 
the miscellaneous category of revenue consists of individually small items in our product portfolio  as well as spares 
it includes products such as docsend our scanning solution and ads our dispatch software 
total revenue generated from these products has increased by in over  while the remaining products in the miscellaneous category decreased by over the same period 
we believe that price reductions for all of our products may affect revenues in the future 
we have made and may in the future make price reductions for our products in order to drive demand and remain competitive 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
if we are not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  our results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents shipments by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows change years ended december  over over in thousands north america europe japan rest of world total revenue from the inket product category from the vutek acquisition in may  along with the introduction of new controller products in the second half of  fueled the increase in revenue in north america  europe and rest of world from to the decrease in japan in over reflects the reduction in chipset solutions sold into japan in the second half of for manufacturing for redistribution around the world 
as shipments to some of our oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations which in turn sell through to other locations  we believe that non us sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported  though accurate data is difficult to obtain 
we expect that non us sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
percentage of total revenue attributed to sales of product through our oem channels has decreased due to the acquisition of vutek in and printcafe in in  more than of revenue is generated from the sales of products through our oem channels with such customers as canon  fuji xerox  konica minolta  oc  oki  ricoh  sharp  toshiba  xerox and others 
the customers that individually accounted for more than of our revenues were canon  konica minolta  and xerox 
together these customers accounted for of our revenues in  in and in the decrease to from is the result of our increased software sales  which are sold to more customers than our traditional server business  and sales to customers of vutek 
although we have decreased our reliance on our oem partners  in the event that any of the oem relationships are scaled back or discontinued  we could still experience an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to work on the development of products utilizing our proprietary architecture and other products and intend to continue to introduce new generations of controller products and other new product lines with current and new oems in and beyond as well as new inkjet and software products to be sold to our direct customers 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of new  current or future products will be successful 
gross margins our gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
the basis point decrease in gross margin from to was due primarily to the acquisition of vutek in which carries lower gross margins than our other products 
the basis point increase in gross margin from to resulted primarily from an increase in software sales compared to the prior year principally due to our acquisitions and the migration of embedded board controller sales to design license sales for certain of our products 
product mix is a significant driver in our gross margins and we cannot predict the impact of it will have on future gross margin results 
our print controllers are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
if our third party manufacturers cannot obtain the necessary components at favorable prices we 
table of contents could experience an increase in our product costs 
we do purchase certain parts directly  including processors  memory  certain asics and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which we license from adobe systems  inc our inkjet printers have a lower gross margin than our traditional controller business 
since we have acquired vutek  the gross margins for the inkjet printers have averaged 
the inks have an average gross margin 
we expect that as the installed base of printers grow that revenues from the inks will increase  which will have a positive effect on our gross margins 
if our product mix changes significantly  our gross margins will fluctuate 
in addition  gross margins can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on our current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors  printheads and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of our product transitions and new products  competition and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  gross margins may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  if we are pressured to reduce prices  gross margins for our products could be lower 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and increased by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue amounted to  and for  and  respectively 
an increase in amortization expense related to vutek of  and in process research and development expense from the vutek acquisition of  account for most of the  increase in compared to increases in the other operating expense categories due to the vutek acquisition were offset by a reduction in workforce initiated in the first quarter of of the  increase in compared to  the largest increase came from the acquisitions made in and with the next largest amount coming from the  of real estate related charges 
less significant additional increases in were from increased payroll expenses  additional trade show expenses  accounting and consulting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  additional legal costs and  in increased amortization expense for identified intangibles offset with a decrease of  from in process research and development costs 
the components of operating expenses are detailed below 
research and development expenses for research and development consist primarily of personnel related and facility expenses and  to a lesser extent  consulting  depreciation and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expenses were  or of revenue in compared to  or of revenue in the increased costs associated with the addition of the vutek employees were partially offset by reduced personnel expenses from the early reduction in workforce and reduced prototype related expenses also contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses in from our acquisitions on an annualized basis account for the majority of the  increase in research and development expenses in when compared to  while our acquisitions accounted for a small additional amount 
as the acquired companies were not maintained as stand alone businesses  the amounts in attributed to acquisitions cannot be accurately determined 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our continued success and intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and product development efforts 
we expect that our research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of revenue 
as part of our cost containment practices  we review all projects on a periodic basis for estimated return on investment 
those projects that do not meet certain criteria are changed or halted 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel related expenses  costs for trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  japan and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were  or of revenue compared to  or of revenue in and  or of revenue in the acquisition of vutek increased our costs by  in  which was offset by  of employee related reductions from the reduction in workforce in the first quarter of and  in reduced tradeshow expenses 
drupa  a leading print industry exposition in europe which occurs every four years in europe  pushed tradeshow expenses higher in we estimate that over half of the increase in from was attributable to our acquisitions when calculated on an annualized basis 
the remaining increase in over primarily came from drupa  our first sponsorship of connect  the annual conference for users of our print mis software and our participation in other trade shows 
included in the increases are the effects of a weaker us dollar  which led to higher us dollar costs for our international sales offices 
while costs in the local currency have generally remained constant  during the translated us dollar costs have increased 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and possibly also as a percentage of revenue as we continue to actively promote our products  launch new products and services  and continue to build our sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and asia pacific  and as we grow our software solutions and other new product lines which require greater sales and marketing support from us 
we also expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro or other currencies  sales and marketing expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
approximately of our sales and marketing expenses are from our foreign offices 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses and  to a lesser extent  depreciation and facility costs  professional fees and other costs associated with public companies 
general and administrative expenses were  or of revenue in  compared to  or of revenue in and  or of revenue in the  increase in general and administrative expenses between and principally consists of from the impact of our acquisition of vutek of  rent increases of  and increased litigation related legal fees 
the increase in general and administrative expenses between and principally consists of from the impact of our acquisitions on an annualized basis  increased costs associated with complying with new regulations related to sox  and increased legal costs related to various litigation matters 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue due to additional costs that will be incurred for compliance with sox  and in order to support our efforts to grow our business in future periods 
we also expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro or other currencies  general and administrative expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 
approximately of our general and administrative expenses are from our foreign offices 
amortization of identifiable intangibles amortization of identifiable intangibles was  or approximately of revenue in amortization of identifiable intangibles  was  or of revenue in the acquisition of two companies in the fourth quarter of and one company in the first quarter of account for the increase in amortization expense

we will be required to adopt fas r during the first quarter of  and at that time will begin recognizing expense related to options granted to employees and members of our board of directors  in addition to the expense related to restricted stock awards 
we are still in the process of implementing fas r and although we expect the charge to be material to our financial statements  we are unable to forecast the actual charges at this time

during the first quarter of we incurred severance costs of approximately  interest and other income interest and other income interest income was  in and increased by approximately from  in  reflecting rising intererst rates

fas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the basis of the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
fas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
fas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant impact on our financial statements

while we will utilize the black scholes merton method to calculate the stock based employee compensation under fas r  we do not have an estimate of the full impact adoption will have on our financial statements  because we are unable to predict the number of stock options that will be granted in and we have not determined the actual variables that will be used in the calculations 
we do anticipate that there will be a significant impact upon our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources all amounts in the following discussion are in thousands 
cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities overview we ended with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling  as compared to  at the end of the decrease of  was from the use of approximately  for the 
table of contents purchase of vutek  offset with cash generated by our operations of approximately  and cash received from employees for purchases of common stock under our espp and the exercise of common stock options of approximately  a more detailed discussion of changes in our liquidity follows 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in  and of   and  respectively  was primarily the result of net income adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  acquired in process research and development  deferred income taxes  stock compensation and changes in various assets and liabilities such as accounts payable  accounts receivable and other current assets 
our historical and primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable 
dsos were days  days  and days at december   and we calculate accounts receivable dso by dividing the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in quarterly revenue and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our accounts receivable dso trended upward in and  reflecting the longer invoice terms offered with our software products  which represented a higher portion of our sales in those years 
the decrease in is a reflection of adjustments made to our accounts receivable related to the vutek acquisition 
we expect that our dsos will trend upwards again in future quarters as a greater portion of our revenues will come from direct sales of printers and software which traditionally carry longer terms 
our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities 
in  the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities reduced our cash flows by approximately  payments for taxes reduced our operating cash flows by our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the cause of the decrease in working capital of approximately  is principally related to lower cash balances resulting from our acquisition of vutek 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash and internally generated funds 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue or what the effect on our business might be from the competitive environment in which we operate 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
investing activities a summary of our investing activities at december   and follows 
the detail of these line items can be seen in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
activity purchases of short term investments proceeds from sales maturities of short term investments net purchases of restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments transfers of investments between restricted and available net purchases of restricted investments purchase of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment businesses acquired  net of cash received purchase of technology changes in other assets net cash used for provided by investing activities 
table of contents acquisitions in  we purchased vutek for  net of cash received of  vutek expands our product offerings from servers and software to include super wide digital inkjet printers 
we are now able to offer printshops a diversified product portfolio 
in  we paid cash for our acquisition of ads technology in the amount of  net of cash received of we purchased ads technology to enhance our software offerings to the copier dealer channels 
we acquired best gmbh for  in cash in january and printcafe software for a combination of shares of our common stock and  in cash in october to add products to our offerings for the professional print industry 
we also purchased t r systems for  in cash in november for their server technology and web based storefront software 
we may buy or make investments in complementary companies  products and technologies 
our available cash and equity may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 
property and equipment our equipment purchases totaled  in we purchased  of equipment during  including costs related to the consolidation of our three arizona offices 
purchases of property and equipment were  in our property and equipment additions have been funded from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business and our business outlook 
investments we received net proceeds from our marketable securities in of  reflecting the liquidation of marketable securities for the purchase of vutek 
in we received net proceeds of  resulting from the liquidation of marketable securities to fund the collateral accounts for our synthetic leases 
in we made purchases net of sales and maturities of our marketable securities of  we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in corporate bonds and u 
s 
government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during the restrictions on certain cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were lifted when the synthetic lease requiring the pledged accounts expired 
approximately  in cash equivalents and short term investments were transferred to investment accounts that carried no restrictions 
collateral accounts in connection with the synthetic leases for our foster city offices  we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts 
at december  there was one account which carried a balance of  for the velocity way building 
in september we withdrew  to reimburse the lessor for the loss in value of that building 
in july we negotiated a new lease for the building located at velocity way  and per provisions in that lease  placed  in cash in a second libor based interest bearing account 
we now have  in collateral accounts 
for further information on these transactions please see the discussion at off balance sheet financing 

table of contents financing activities historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of   and  in  and  respectively 
the lower proceeds in is reflective of our lower stock price during that period 
if our stock price rises  more employees options are in the money in their options  and the employees are more likely to exercise their options  which results in cash to us 
if our stock price decreases  more of our employees options are out of the money or under water  and therefore  the employees will be unlikely to exercise options  which results in no cash received by us 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
under fas r we will be required to expense the fair market value of stock options granted and we may decide to decrease the number of stock options granted in future periods 
the primary use of funds for financing activities in and was the use of  and  respectively  of cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our programs to repurchase our common stock 
in  we received net proceeds from the issuance of our senior convertible debentures in the amount of  net of issuance costs 
the synthetic lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
under fin  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantees have no material value as of december  and therefore have not recorded any liability 
other commitments our inventory consists primarily of memory subsystems  processors and asics for our controller products  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products and inkjet printheads  frames and other components related to our manufacturer of inkjet printers 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing of controllers  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially fixed assets would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventory we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
should our volumes increase materially on our inkjet printers  our purchases of inkjet printheads  frames and other components will also increase correspondingly 
we may be required to compensate our sub contract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate the sub contract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the accrued liability 
legal proceedings in addition to the matters discussed under item  legal proceedings  we are involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of our business 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital purchase obligations interest payments on senior convertible debentures long term debt obligations total lease obligations related to the principal corporate facilities are estimated and are based on current market interest rates libor 
see off balance sheet financing below see off balance sheet financing below 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our senior convertible debentures total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on efi and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet financing all amounts in this section are presented in thousands  except for per share amounts 
synthetic lease arrangements we are a party to two synthetic leases the lease and the lease  together leases covering our foster city facilities located at and velocity way  foster city  california 
these leases provide a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
both leases expire in july we may  at our option  purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the leases for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities  for the lease and  for the lease 
we have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the buildings equal to of their funding of the respective leases 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum 
table of contents tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of december  we are liable to the lessor for the financed amount of the buildings if we default on our covenants 
we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantees under the leases and believe that there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
the funds pledged under the leases  for the lease and  for the lease at december  for a total of  are in libor based interest bearing accounts and are restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
in conjunction with the leases  we have entered into separate ground leases with the lessor for approximately years 
we are treated as the owner of these buildings for federal income tax purposes 
effective july   we applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin r for variable interest entities vies 
we have evaluated our synthetic lease agreements to determine if the arrangements qualify as variable interest entities under fin r 
we have determined that the synthetic lease agreements do qualify as vies  however  because we are not the primary beneficiary under fin r we are not required to consolidate the vies in our financial statements 
factors that could adversely affect performance and financial results item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all amounts in this section are presented in thousands  except for per share amounts 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps over a twelve month time horizon 
this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of basis points total fair market value 
table of contents the fair value of our long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be  as of december  and the carrying value was  the fair market value of our convertible senior debentures was estimated based upon quoted market prices 
derivatives we do not use any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and europe and operating expenses in germany  india  japan and the netherlands 
at the present time  we do not hedge against these currency exposures  but as these exposures grow we may consider hedging against currency movements 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities  typically us treasury securities and municipal bonds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
