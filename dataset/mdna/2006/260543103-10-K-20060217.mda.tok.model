asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem  are and have been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
based on a study completed by analysis  research planning corporation arpc in january  union carbide increased its december  asbestos related liability for pending and future claims for the year period ending in to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
union carbide also increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion at december  in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in january  arpc provided union carbide with a report summarizing the results of its study 
based on arpc s january and january studies  union carbide s asbestos litigation experience  and the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and legislative reform efforts  union carbide s management determined that no change to the accrual was required at december  in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating the january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  in january  arpc stated that an update of the study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in its study of the previous year and  therefore  the estimate in that study remained applicable 
based on union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity and arpc s response  union carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required at december  union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion at december  and billion at december  union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  and million at december  in addition  union carbide had receivables for insurance recoveries of million at december  and million at december   for defense and resolution costs 
the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable were based upon current  known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded

environmental matters the company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress  or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the company had accrued obligations of million at december   for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
at december   the company had accrued obligations of million for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
for further discussion  see environmental matters in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and notes a and k to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the us pension plans represent approximately percent of the company s pension plan assets and obligations 
the following information relates to the us plans only  a similar approach is used for the company s non us plans 
the company determined the expected long term rate of return on assets by performing a bottom up analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the finance committee of the board of directors and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class 
the company s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance and comparisons to expected returns of peer companies with similar fund assets were also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was percent 
this assumption was unchanged for determining net periodic pension expense 
the company s historical actual return averaged percent for the ten year period ending december  the actual rate of return in was percent 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
a basis point adjustment in the long term return on assets assumption would change total pension expense for by approximately million 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the principal us qualified plans is based on a broad based index of high quality bonds receiving an aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency and matched to the future expected cash flows by half year periods by plan 
the resulting discount rate decreased from percent at december   to percent at december  a basis point adjustment in the discount rate assumption would change total pension expense for by approximately million  with an immaterial change to other postretirement benefit expense due to defined dollar limits caps 
the value of the principal us qualified plan assets increased from billion at december   to billion at december  the company made contributions of million to the us qualified plans in the favorable impact of the contributions was partially offset by the decline in the assumed discount rate  resulting in a net reduction of million in the funded status shortfall from december  to december  for  the company maintained its assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels for the principal us qualified plans of percent 
since  the company has used a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations 
the following discussion relates to all of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of plan assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets 
since the market related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of plan assets will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
over the life of the plan  both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized 
at december   net losses of million remain to be recognized by the qualified plans in the calculation of the market related value of plan assets 
these net losses will result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market related value of assets and are a component of the unrecognized net loss of  million shown under funded status and net amounts recognized in the table entitled change in projected benefit obligations  plan assets and funded status of all significant plans included in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
the  million of remaining unrecognized net loss represents changes in plan experience and actuarial assumptions 
the increase or decrease in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains and losses is presented in the following table increase decrease in market related asset value due to recognition of prior asset gains and losses in millions total based on the revised pension assumptions and changes in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior asset gains and losses  the company expects to record approximately million of incremental expense for all pension and other postretirement benefits in compared with the company also expects to make contributions of million to its pension plans in income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  both positive and negative  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of billion  after valuation allowances of million 
in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets  the company relies principally on forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences and the availability of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of billion  million of which is subject to expiration in the years in order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  the company needs taxable income of approximately billion across multiple jurisdictions 
the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration between is approximately million 
the company accrues for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated  based on past experience 
the tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as significant amendments to existing tax law 
at december   the company had a tax contingency reserve for both domestic and foreign issues of million

environmental matters environmental policies dow is committed to world class environmental  health and safety eh s performance  as demonstrated by a long standing commitment to responsible care and progress made toward the company s eh s goals for in  dow publicly announced its voluntary global eh s goals ambitious performance targets to measure progress toward sustainable development  including targets to reduce chemical emissions  waste and wastewater by percent 
equally aggressive were dow s eh s goals to reduce leaks  spills  fires  explosions  work related injuries and transportation incidents by percent 
dow continues to work aggressively toward attainment of its goals and its vision of zero 
in  dow developed its next generation of year goals that will provide continuity to the first set of goals  while also addressing a broader set of challenges 
the sustainability goals will set the standard for sustainability in the chemical industry by focusing on improvements in dow s local corporate citizenship and product stewardship  and by actively pursuing methods to reduce the company s environmental impact

to meet the company s public commitments  as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject  dow has well defined policies  requirements and management systems 
dow s eh s management system ems defines for the businesses the who  what  when and how needed to achieve the company s policies  requirements  performance objectives  leadership expectations and public commitments 
ems is also designed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection and to comply with these laws and regulations 
in and  the security aspects of dow s ems were strengthened to require that site vulnerability assessments be conducted to ensure appropriate safeguards to protect dow s employees and physical assets in a post world 
furthermore  to ensure effective utilization  the ems is integrated into a company wide management system for eh s  operations  quality and human resources 
it is dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for waste that is transferred to non dow facilities  including the periodic auditing of these facilities 
dow believes third party verification is a cornerstone of world class eh s performance and building public trust 
numerous dow sites in europe  latin america  australia and north america have received third party verification of dow s compliance with responsible care and with outside specifications such as iso additional sites in the united states will receive third party auditing over the next two years in support of new industry wide responsible care expectations 
dow received the american chemistry council s responsible care employee health safety code sustained excellence award three years in row 
the annual sustained excellence award recognizes companies that have demonstrated outstanding safety records over a three year period 
dow remains the only company from the large size category to ever receive this award 
dow s eh s policies helped the company achieve excellent safety performance in dow demonstrated continuous improvement in reducing its personal injury and illness osha occupational safety and health administration rate  although  tragically  there were three fatalities during the company also posted a significant reduction in leaks  breaks and spills  and notices of violation from environmental regulatory agencies in improvement in environmental compliance remains a top management priority  with initiatives underway to further improve compliance in chemical security growing public and political attention has been placed on protecting critical infrastructure  including the chemical industry  from security threats 
terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concern about the security of chemical production and distribution 
there is an increasing call by many  including dow and the american chemistry council  for uniform performance based national standards for securing the us chemical industry 
the focus on security is not new to dow 
dow has maintained a comprehensive  multi level security plan since this plan was activated in response to the events of dow continues to improve its security plans  placing emphasis on the safety of dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks 
dow s security plans also are developed to avert interruptions of normal business work operations which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
dow uses a risk based approach employing the us government s sandia national labs methodology to repeatedly assess the risks to sites  systems  and processes 
the comprehensive distribution risk review process that has been in place for decades was expanded to address potential threats in all modes of transportation across the company s supply chain 
to reduce vulnerabilities  dow maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which the company operates 
dow played a key role in the development and implementation of the american chemistry council s responsible care security code that requires all aspects of security including facility  transportation  and cyberspace be assessed and gaps addressed 
through the company s global implementation of the security code  dow has permanently heightened the level of security not just in the united states  but worldwide 
assessment and improvement costs are expected to be approximately million  over three years  and are not considered material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
total costs invested since  included in the company s operational costs  are estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars attributable to plant security  supply chain and cyberspace security enhancements  upgrades  regulatory compliance and response capabilities 
dow continually works to strengthen partnerships with local responders  law enforcement  and security agencies and to enhance confidence in the integrity of the company s security and risk management program  as well as strengthen its preparedness and response capabilities 
dow also works closely with its supply chain partners and strives to educate lawmakers  regulators and communities about the company s resolve and actions to date which are mitigating security and crisis threats 
climate change there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg due to human activities continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the climate 
political debates continue about how to implement fair and effective ghg mitigation efforts 
dow takes global climate change very seriously and is not waiting for the resolution of the debate 
dow is committed to reducing its ghg intensity pounds of ghg per pound of product  developing climate friendly products and processes and  over the longer term  implementing technology solutions to achieve even greater climate change improvements 
since  dow has reduced ghg direct emission intensity by over percent 
total direct emissions of ghg have also been significantly reduced 
this trend could reverse  however  depending on business growth  capacity utilization and the pace of new technology development 
given the uncertainties regarding implementation of the kyoto protocol and related climate change policies  it is speculative to engage in an assessment of either the potential liability or benefit associated with climate change issues 
since  the company has achieved a percent improvement in energy intensity the amount of energy required to produce one pound of product 
in doing so  it has avoided consuming more than trillion btus  a saving that when converted to electricity would be more than sufficient to supply the electricity consumed by residential users in the state of california for one year 
these efficiency improvements also result in the reduction of ghg emissions 
dow also contributes to the climate change solution by producing products that help others reduce ghg emissions  such as lightweight plastics for automobiles and insulation for energy efficient homes and appliances 
dow has demonstrated its commitment to technological innovation and conservation though its exploration of renewable energy sources 
in february  dow and general motors announced the start up of a joint project to prove the viability of hydrogen fuel cells for large industrial power systems  using hydrogen from the company s production processes at its freeport  texas  facility 
in november of that year  the project was expanded from a single test cell to a multi cell pilot plant  which can generate up to one megawatt of electricity 
this project is still underway 
dow has formed a climate change and energy policy strategy board to establish the company s direction regarding ghg management  including ghg emission credit trading 
environmental remediation dow accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
the nature of such remediation includes  for example  the management of soil and groundwater contamination and the closure of contaminated landfills and other waste management facilities 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the liability related to remediation at december  was million 
the company has not recorded any third party recovery related to these sites as a receivable 
in addition to current and former dow owned sites  under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law  dow is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where dow allegedly disposed of  or arranged for the treatment or disposal of  hazardous substances 
dow readily cooperates in the remediation of these sites where the company s liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december  was million 
at december   the company s liability for the remediation of superfund sites was million 
information regarding environmental sites is provided below environmental sites dow owned sites superfund sites number of sites at january sites added during year sites closed during year number of sites at december dow owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed in the united states by the resource conservation recovery act or analogous state law 
of these sites were formerly owned by dowell schlumberger  inc  a group of companies in which the company previously owned a percent interest 
dow sold its interest in dowell schlumberger in superfund sites are sites  including sites not owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed by superfund law 
the company s manufacturing sites in freeport  texas  and midland  michigan  are the sites for which the company has the largest environmental remediation accruals 
from the start of operations at the freeport site in the s until the mid s  manufacturing wastes were typically placed in on site pits and landfills 
the resulting soil and groundwater contamination is being assessed and remediated under the provisions of the resource conservation recovery act rcra  in concert with the state of texas 
at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  related to environmental remediation at the freeport manufacturing site 
in  million million in was spent on environmental remediation at the freeport site 
similar to the freeport site  in the early days of operations at the midland site  manufacturing wastes were usually disposed of on site  resulting in soil and groundwater contamination  which has been contained and managed on site under a series of rcra permits and regulatory agreements 
the most recent hazardous waste operating license for the midland site  issued in  also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off site contamination from historic midland site operations 
the scope of the investigation includes midland area soils  tittabawassee and saginaw river sediment and floodplain soils  and saginaw bay and requires the company to conduct interim response actions 
see note k to the consolidated financial statement for additional information 
at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the midland site 
in  the company spent million million in on environmental remediation at the midland site 
in total  the company s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation introduction union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages 
the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past  alleged exposure to asbestos containing products located on union carbide s premises  and union carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem 
in many cases  plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide s products 
influenced by the bankruptcy filings of numerous defendants in asbestos related litigation and the prospects of various forms of state and national legislative reform  the rate at which plaintiffs filed asbestos related suits against various companies  including union carbide and amchem  increased in  and the first half of since then  the rate of filing has significantly abated 
union carbide expects more asbestos related suits to be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future  and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve  as appropriate  both pending and future claims 
the table below provides information regarding asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem claims unresolved at january    claims filed    claims settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved   claims unresolved at december    claimants with claims against both union carbide and amchem  individual claimants at december    plaintiffs lawyers often sue dozens or even hundreds of defendants in individual lawsuits on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of claimants 
as a result  the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide  amchem or any other particular defendant  even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury 
in fact  there are no personal injury cases in which only union carbide and or amchem are the sole named defendants 
for these reasons and based upon union carbide s litigation and settlement experience  union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos liability 
estimating the liability based on a study completed by analysis  research planning corporation arpc in january  union carbide increased its december  asbestos related liability for pending and future claims for the year period ending in to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
at each balance sheet date  union carbide compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the assumptions in the arpc study to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in january  arpc provided union carbide with a report summarizing the results of its study 
at december   union carbide s recorded asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion 
based on the low end of the range in the january study  union carbide s recorded asbestos related liability for pending and future claims at december  would be sufficient to resolve asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem into as in its january study  arpc did provide estimates for a longer period of time in its january study  but also reaffirmed its prior advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate than those for longer periods of time 
based on arpc s studies  union carbide s asbestos litigation experience  and the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and legislative reform efforts  union carbide s management determined that no change to the accrual was required at december  in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating the january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  in january  arpc stated that an update of the study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in its study of the previous year and  therefore  the estimate in that study remained applicable 
based on union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity and arpc s response  union carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required at december  union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion at december  and billion at december  at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 
at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 
defense and resolution costs the following table provides information regarding defense and resolution costs related to asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem defense and resolution costs in millions aggregate costs to date as of dec 
 defense costs resolution costs  the average resolution payment per asbestos claimant and the rate of new claim filings has fluctuated both up and down since the beginning of union carbide s management expects such fluctuations to continue in the future based upon the number and type of claims settled in a particular period  the jurisdictions in which such claims arose  and the extent to which any proposed legislative reform related to asbestos litigation is being considered 
insurance receivables at december   union carbide increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion  substantially exhausting its asbestos product liability coverage 
the insurance receivable related to the asbestos liability was determined by union carbide after a thorough review of applicable insurance policies and the wellington agreement  to which union carbide and many of its liability insurers are signatory parties  as well as other insurance settlements  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  and taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers 
the wellington agreement and other agreements with insurers are designed to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of union carbide s insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 
union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  and million at december  at december   million million at december  of the receivable for insurance recoveries was related to insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage 
in addition  union carbide had receivables for defense and resolution costs submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement as follows receivables for costs submitted to insurance carriers at december in millions receivables for defense costs receivables for resolution costs total union carbide expenses defense costs as incurred 
the pretax impact for defense and resolution costs  net of insurance  was million in  million in and million in  and was reflected in cost of sales 
in september  union carbide filed a comprehensive insurance coverage case in the circuit court for kanawha county in charleston  west virginia  seeking to confirm its rights to insurance for various asbestos claims the west virginia action and to facilitate an orderly and timely collection of insurance proceeds 
although union carbide already has settlements in place concerning coverage for asbestos claims with many of its insurers  including those covered by the wellington agreement  this lawsuit was filed against insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place with union carbide regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage  in order to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of such insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 
in early  several of the defendant insurers in the west virginia action filed a competing action in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york 
as a result of motion practice  the west virginia action was dismissed in august on the basis of forum non conveniens ie  west virginia is an inconvenient location for the parties 
the comprehensive insurance coverage litigation is now proceeding in the new york courts the new york action 
the insurance carriers are contesting this litigation 
through the fourth quarter of  union carbide reached settlements with several of the carriers involved in the new york action 
after a further review of its insurance policies  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  after taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers  existing insurance settlements  and the advice of outside counsel with respect to the applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of its insurance policies  union carbide continues to believe that its recorded receivable for insurance recoveries from all insurance carriers is probable of collection 
summary the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon current  known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded 
because of the uncertainties described above  union carbide s management cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem 
union carbide s management believes that it is reasonably possible that the cost of disposing of union carbide s asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on union carbide s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of union carbide 
it is the opinion of dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of union carbide disposing of its asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the company 
the dow chemical company and subsidiaries part ii  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  where appropriate 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non specific exposure within established limits and policies  derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges per sfas no 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global basis  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts  over the counter option contracts  cross currency swaps  and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the euro and japanese yen  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the us dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to european currencies and the japanese yen 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions  and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived from its acquisition and divestiture activity 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
feedstocks for ethylene production and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
on an ongoing basis  the company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day  given a two standard deviation movement in the respective price levels 
these amounts are relatively insignificant in comparison to the size of the equity of the company 
the var methodology used by dow is based primarily on the variance covariance statistical model 
the year end var and average daily var for the aggregate of non trading and trading positions for and are shown below total daily var at december in millions year end average year end average foreign exchange interest rate equity exposures  net of hedges commodities using a percent confidence level see note i to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding market risk
