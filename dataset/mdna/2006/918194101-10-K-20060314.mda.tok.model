at december   our animal hospital network consisted of animal hospitals in states 
medical technology 
we sell ultrasound and digital radiography imaging equipment  related computer hardware  software and ancillary services 
corporate 
we provide selling  general and administrative support for our other segments 
the practice of veterinary medicine is subject to seasonal fluctuation 
in particular  demand for veterinary services is significantly higher during the warmer months because pets spend a greater amount of time outdoors where they are more likely to be injured and are more susceptible to disease and parasites 
in addition  use of veterinary services may be affected by levels of flea infestation  heartworm and ticks and the number of daylight hours 
executive overview we experienced strong operating results for the prior two years  marked by continued growth in our laboratory and animal hospital segments 
our revenue in increased compared to the prior year to million and our diluted earnings per common share was  which included debt retirement costs of 
our revenue in increased compared to the prior year to million and our diluted earnings per common share was  which included debt retirement costs and a litigation reimbursement that in aggregate had no impact on eps 
acquisitions our growth strategy includes the acquisition of to independent animal hospitals per year with aggregate annual revenues of approximately million to million 
in addition  we also evaluate the acquisition of animal hospital chains  laboratories or related businesses if favorable opportunities are presented 
on july   we acquired pet s choice  inc  or pet s choice  which operated animal hospitals  and on june   we acquired national petcare centers  inc  or npc  which operated 
table of contents animal hospitals 
the following table summarizes our laboratory and animal hospital facilities growth and animal hospital closures tweleve months ended december  laboratories beginning of period acquisition and new facilities new facilities relocated into laboratories operated by us end of period animal hospitals beginning of period acquisitions  excluding pet s choice and npc pet s choice npc new facilities acquisitions relocated into hospitals operated by us sold or closed end of period pet s choice was acquired on july  npc was acquired on june  acquisition of pet s choice  inc on july   we acquired pet s choice  which operated animal hospitals located in five states as of the acquisition date 
this acquisition allowed us to expand our animal hospital operations in five states  particularly texas and washington 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of pet s choice since july  as of december   we had not finalized the purchase price accounting for the pet s choice acquisition  as we have not received final invoices from professional service providers and the valuation of certain tax assets and liabilities has not been finalized 
all of these items could result in a change to the total purchase price 
the total consideration as of december  was million  consisting of million in cash paid to holders of pet s choice stock and debt  million in assumed debt  million in assumed liabilities  million of operating leases whose terms were in excess of market   paid for professional and other outside services  and  paid as part of our plan to close the pet s choice corporate office and terminate certain employees 
in addition  we incurred costs of approximately million primarily to operate pet s choice s corporate office  which was closed in october these costs were expensed as incurred and are included in corporate selling  general and administrative expense 
acquisition of sound technologies  inc on october   we acquired sound technologies  inc  or sti  which is a supplier of ultrasound and digital radiography equipment and related computer hardware  software and services to the veterinary industry 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we may be obligated to pay after december  up to million of additional purchase price if certain performance targets are met 

table of contents the total consideration  excluding the million contingent obligation described above  was million  consisting of million in cash paid to holders of sti stock  including additional consideration of million paid in  million in assumed debt  million in assumed liabilities  and  paid for professional and other outside services 
acquisition of national petcare centers  inc on june   we acquired npc  which operated animal hospitals located in states as of the merger date

the total consideration for this acquisition was million  consisting of million in cash paid to holders of npc stock and debt  million in assumed debt  million in assumed liabilities  million of operating leases whose terms were in excess of market  million paid for professional and other outside services  and million paid as part of our plan to close certain facilities and terminate certain employees 
in addition  we incurred costs of approximately million primarily to operate npc s corporate office  which was closed in september these costs were expensed as incurred and are included in corporate selling  general and administrative expense 
common stock activity in february  we completed an offering of our common stock 
as a result of this offering we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
we applied the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay the entire remaining principal amount of our senior notes 
on august   we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to stockholders of record as of august  all share and per share information included in this document have been restated to reflect the effect of the stock dividend 
critical accounting policies we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note  summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
revenue laboratory and animal hospital revenue we recognize laboratory and animal hospital revenue only after the following criteria are met there exists adequate evidence of the transaction  delivery of goods has occurred or services have been rendered  and the price is not contingent on future activity and collectibility is reasonably assured 
medical technology revenue the majority of our medical technology revenue is derived from the sale of ultrasound imaging equipment and digital radiography equipment 
we also derive revenue from i licensing our software  ii providing technical support and product updates related to our software  otherwise known as maintenance  and iii providing professional services related to our equipment and software  including installations  on site training and education services 
we frequently sell equipment and license our software 
table of contents in multiple element arrangements in which the customer may choose a combination of one or more of the following elements i ultrasound imaging equipment  ii digital radiography equipment  iii software products  iv computer hardware  v maintenance  and vi professional services 
the accounting for the sale of equipment is substantially governed by the requirements of staff accounting bulletin  sab  no 
 revenue recognition  as amended  and the sale of software licenses and related items is governed by statement of position  sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
the determination of the amount of software license  maintenance and professional service revenue to be recognized in each accounting period requires us to exercise judgment and use estimates 
in determining whether or not to recognize revenue  we evaluate each of these criteria evidence of an arrangement we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer and us to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery we consider delivery to have occurred when the ultrasound imaging equipment is delivered 
we consider delivery to have occurred when the digital radiography imaging equipment is either accepted by the customer if installation is required  or delivered 
we consider delivery to have occurred with respect to professional services when those services are provided or on a straight line basis over the service contract term  based on the nature of the service or the terms of the contract 
fixed or determinable fee we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
we generally consider payments that are due within six months to be fixed or determinable based upon our successful collection history 
we only consider fees to be fixed or determinable if they are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is deemed probable we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
under the residual method prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  in multiple element arrangements involving software  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  maintenance and professional services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the equipment  computer hardware or the software product 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price for those products and services when sold separately by us and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
each transaction requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each element 
ultrasound imaging equipment we sell our ultrasound imaging equipment with and without related computer hardware and software 
we account for the sale of ultrasound imaging equipment on a stand alone basis under the requirements of sab no 
 and recognize revenue upon delivery 
we account for the sale of ultrasound imaging equipment with related computer hardware and software by bifurcating the transaction into separate elements 
we account for the ultrasound imaging equipment under the requirements of sab no 
 as the software is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the equipment  and account for the computer hardware and software under the requirements of sop no 
 as amended 
for the later 
table of contents arrangements  we recognize revenue on the ultrasound imaging equipment  computer hardware and software upon delivery  which occurs simultaneously 
digital radiography equipment we sell our digital radiography imaging equipment with related computer hardware and software 
the digital radiography equipment requires the computer hardware and software to function 
as a result  we account for digital radiography imaging equipment sales under sop no 
in the third quarter of  we established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of post contract customer support services by including renewal rates in the sales contracts 
as a result  we began recognizing revenue on the sales of digital radiography imaging equipment  computer hardware and software at the time of customer acceptance if installation is required  or delivery  and revenue from post contract customer support services on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
prior to the third quarter of  we recognized revenue on all elements in these arrangements ratably over the period of the post contract customer support services 
valuation of goodwill our goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the total amount of our goodwill at december  was million  consisting of million for our laboratory segment  million for our animal hospital segment and million for our medical technology segment 
annually  and upon material changes in our operating environment  we test our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair market value of our reporting units  laboratory  animal hospital and medical technology  to their respective net book value 
at december  and  the estimated fair market value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book value  resulting in a conclusion that our goodwill was not impaired 
income taxes we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets  which represent taxes to be recovered or settled in the future 
we adjust our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to reflect changes in tax rates or other statutory tax provisions 
changes in tax rates or other statutory provisions are recognized in the period the change occurs 
we made judgments in assessing our ability to realize future benefits from our deferred tax assets  which include operating and capital loss carryforwards 
as such  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets for the portion we believe will not be realized 
at december   we used valuation allowances to offset net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards where the realization of this deduction is uncertain 
we also have recognized liabilities for differences between the probable tax bases and the as filed tax bases of certain assets and liabilities recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
this liability relates to losses that to our best judgment are probable 
changes in facts and circumstances may cause us to lower our estimates or determine that payments are no longer probable resulting in a reduction of our future tax provision  or increase our estimates resulting in an increase in our future tax provision 
in addition  there are certain tax contingencies that represent a possible future payment but not a probable one 
while we have not recognized a liability for these possible future payments  they may result in future cash payments and increase our tax provision

computed by dividing total internal revenue by the number of requisitions 
the billing day adjustment in the comparative analysis reflects the impact of one additional billing day in as compared to the billing day adjustment in the comparative analysis reflects the impact of one additional billing day in as compared to 
table of contents the increases in requisitions from internal growth in and are the result of a continued trend in veterinary medicine to focus on the importance of laboratory diagnostic testing in the diagnosis  early detection and treatment of diseases 
this trend is driven by an increase in the number of specialists in the veterinary industry relying on diagnostic testing  the increased focus on diagnostic testing in veterinary schools and general increased awareness through ongoing marketing and continuing education programs provided by ourselves  pharmaceutical companies and other service providers in the industry 
the changes in the average revenue per requisition in and are attributable to changes in the mix  type and number of tests performed per requisition and price increases 
the price increases for most tests ranged from to in both february and february as the result of our laboratory acquisitions subsequent to january   we generated an additional million of revenue referred to in the above table as acquired revenue in as compared to animal hospital revenue animal hospital revenue increased million in as compared to  which increased million as compared to the components of the increases are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages and average price per order comparative analysis comparative analysis animal hospital revenue change change same store facility orders average revenue per order same store revenue business day adjustment net acquired revenue total same store revenue and orders were calculated using animal hospital operating results  adjusted to exclude the operating results for the newly acquired animal hospitals that we did not own for the entire periods presented and adjusted for the impact resulting from any differences in the number of business days in comparable periods

over the last few years  some pet related products  including medication prescriptions  traditionally sold at animal hospitals have become more widely available in retail stores and other distribution channels  and  as a result  we have fewer customers coming to our animal hospitals solely to purchase those items 
in addition  there has been a decline in the number of vaccinations as some recent professional literature and research has suggested that vaccinations can be given to pets less frequently 
our business strategy continues to place a greater emphasis on comprehensive wellness visits and advanced medical procedures  
table of contents which typically generate higher priced orders 
these trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of orders and an increase in the average revenue per order 
price increases  which ranged from to on services at most hospitals in february and to in february  also contributed to the increase in the average revenue per order 
prices are reviewed on an annual basis for each hospital and adjustments are made based on market considerations  demographics and our costs 
medical technology revenue medical technology revenue was million and million in and  respectively 
contributing to the increase in medical technology revenue was the fact we acquired sti on october  and thus only included three months of operating results 
the increase in medical technology revenue was also attributable to sales of our digital radiography imaging equipment  which was a new product in further contributing to the increase in medical technology revenue was that effective july   we began recognizing revenue on sales of our digital radiography imaging equipment  computer hardware and software at the time of customer acceptance if installation is required  or delivery  as discussed under critical accounting policies 
prior to july   we recognized all elements in sales of our digital radiography imaging equipment over the period of the post contract customer support services 
at december   we had deferred revenue of million  million of which related to sales of our digital radiography imaging equipment 
intercompany revenue approximately million  million and million of our laboratory revenue in  and  respectively  was intercompany revenue that was generated by providing laboratory services to our animal hospitals 
approximately million of our medical technology revenue in was intercompany revenue that was generated by providing products and services to our animal hospitals 
for purposes of reviewing the operating performance of our business segments  all intercompany transactions are accounted for as if the transaction was with an independent third party at current market prices 
for financial reporting purposes  intercompany transactions are eliminated as part of our consolidation 
gross profit the following table summarizes our gross profit and our gross profit as a percentage of applicable revenue  or gross profit margin in thousands  except percentages change gross gross gross profit profit profit margin margin margin laboratory animal hospital medical technology other total gross profit laboratory gross profit laboratory gross profit is calculated as laboratory revenue less laboratory direct costs 
laboratory direct costs are comprised of all costs of laboratory services  including but not limited to  salaries of veterinarians  specialists  technicians and other laboratory based personnel  facilities rent  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization and supply costs 

table of contents the increase in laboratory gross profit margin was primarily attributable to increases in laboratory revenue combined with operating leverage associated with our laboratory business 
our operating leverage comes from the incremental margins we realize on additional tests ordered by the same client  as well as when more comprehensive tests are ordered 
we are able to benefit from these incremental margins due to the relative fixed cost nature of our laboratory business 
animal hospital gross profit animal hospital gross profit is calculated as animal hospital revenue less animal hospital direct costs 
animal hospital direct costs are comprised of all costs of services and products at the animal hospitals  including  but not limited to  salaries of veterinarians  technicians and all other animal hospital based personnel  facilities rent  occupancy costs  supply costs  depreciation and amortization  certain marketing and promotional expense and costs of goods sold associated with the retail sales of pet food and pet supplies 
over the last several years we have acquired a significant number of animal hospitals  including in connection with the acquisition of pet s choice on july  and in connection with the acquisition of npc on june  many of these newly acquired animal hospitals had lower gross profit margins at the time of acquisition than those previously operated by us 
these lower gross profit margins were offset by improvements in animal hospital revenue  increased operating leverage and the favorable impact of our integration efforts 
medical technology gross profit medical technology gross profit is calculated as medical technology revenue less medical technology direct costs 
medical technology direct costs are comprised of all product and service costs  including  but not limited to  all costs of equipment  related products and services  salaries of technicians  support personnel  trainers  consultants and other non administrative personnel  depreciation and amortization and supply costs 
the increase in medical technology gross profit was primarily due to the fact we acquired sti on october  and thus only included three months of operating results 
the decrease in medical technology gross profit margins in as compared to was primarily the result of a change in the mix of products and services sold 
at december   we had deferred revenue and costs of million and million  respectively 
included in these amounts at december  was million of deferred revenue and million of deferred costs related to sales of our digital radiography imaging equipment

debt retirement costs in connection with debt refinancing transactions and voluntary debt repayments  we incurred debt retirement costs of million   and million in  and  respectively 
these transactions are discussed below in the liquidity and capital resources section 
other income other income relates to non cash gains pertaining to the changes in the time value of our interest rate swap agreements 
minority interest in income of subsidiaries minority interest in income of subsidiaries represents our partners proportionate shares of net income generated by those subsidiaries that we do not wholly own 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for as compared to and the effective tax rate for as compared to each reflect a lower weighted average state statutory tax rate due to a favorable shift in the number of facilities that we operated in states with lower tax rates or no state income tax 
the changes in our statutory tax rates were effected in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for as compared to was also the result of a litigation settlement reimbursement in the amount of million  which we discuss above in the corporate sg a section  which had no related tax expense 
inflation historically  our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
we cannot assure that our operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents related party transactions transactions with zoasis corporation we incurred marketing expense for vaccine reminders and other direct mail services provided by zoasis  a company that is majority owned by robert antin  our chief executive officer and chairman 
art antin  our chief operating officer  owns a interest in zoasis and a separate officer sold his entire interest in zoasis in for less than  we purchased services of million   and  for   and  respectively 
the pricing of these services is comparable to prices paid by us to independent third parties for similar services 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million in as compared to primarily due to improved operating performance and acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to primarily due to improved operating performance and acquisitions 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid of million and a use of working capital of million 
on a prospective basis  we anticipate cash flow from operating activities to continue growing in line with increases in operating income resulting from improved operating performance and acquisitions 
however  we also anticipate that operating cash flow may be negatively impacted by an increase in cash paid for interest as a result of possible future increases in interest rates 
interest rates have been at historical lows and are projected to increase over the next several years 
significant increases in interest rates may materially impact our operating cash flows because of the variable rate nature of our senior credit facility 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for the acquisition of animal hospitals and expenditures for property and equipment 
depending upon the attractiveness of the candidates and the strategic fit with our existing operations  we intend to acquire approximately to independent animal hospitals per year with aggregate annual revenues of approximately million to million 
in addition  we also evaluate the acquisition of animal hospital chains  laboratories or related businesses if favorable opportunities are presented 
in accord with that strategy  we acquired pet s choice  which operated animal hospitals  on july  in addition  we acquired sti  which is a supplier of ultrasound and digital radiography equipment and related computer hardware  software and services to the veterinary industry  on october   and we acquired npc  which operated animal hospitals  on june we intend to primarily use cash in our acquisitions but  depending on the timing and amount of our acquisitions  we may use stock or debt 
in  we also intend to spend approximately to million for property and equipment 

table of contents financing activities in may  we entered into a new senior credit facility that provided million of senior term notes and a million revolving credit facility 
the funds borrowed under the new senior term notes were used to retire our existing senior term notes in the principal amount of million and repurchase our senior subordinated notes in the principal amount of million 
the new senior term notes also provided the necessary financing to acquire pet s choice  which we discuss in note  acquisitions  in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the refinancing transactions  we paid financing costs of approximately million and paid an aggregate tender fee of million to purchase the senior subordinated notes 
in january and august  we voluntarily prepaid million and million  respectively  of our senior term notes 
in june  we amended and restated our senior credit facility to replace the existing senior term notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of with new senior term notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of 
the additional borrowings were used to fund the npc merger 
in connection with this refinancing transaction  we paid financing costs of in december  we amended and restated our senior credit facility to replace the existing senior term notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of with new senior term notes in the same principal amount with an interest rate margin of 
in connection with this transaction  we paid financing costs of  in february  we sold million shares of our common stock 
approximately million of the million in net proceeds received were used to redeem the entire principal amount of our senior notes due at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with this transaction  we paid financing costs of  in august  we refinanced our senior credit facility to replace the existing senior term notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of with million of cash on hand and new senior term notes in the principal amount of million with an interest rate margin of 
in connection with this transaction  we paid financing costs of  borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility are the result of normal working capital shifts created by the seasonality of our business and the timing of acquisition activity 
at the end of we borrowed million  and in early we repaid the full amount 
at december   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
future contractual cash requirements the following table sets forth the scheduled principal  interest and other contractual cash obligations due by us for each of the years indicated in thousands total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases fixed cash interest expense variable cash interest expense swap agreements purchase obligations other long term liabilities 
table of contents on january   we voluntarily prepaid million of our senior term notes 
this payment is reflected in the above table 
we have variable rate debt 
the interest payments on our variable rate debt are based on a variable rate component plus a fixed 
for purposes of this computation  we have assumed that the interest rate on our variable rate debt including the fixed rate portion will be    and for years through thereafter  respectively 
our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k discuss these variable rate notes in more detail 
includes deferred income taxes of million 
the table above excludes certain contractual arrangements whereby additional cash may be paid to former owners of acquired businesses upon attainment of specified performance targets 
we may be required to pay up to million in future periods if these performance targets are achieved 
we anticipate that our cash on hand  net cash provided by operations and  if needed  our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient cash resources to fund our operations for more than the next months 
if we consummate one or more significant acquisitions during this period we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing 
debt covenants our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios 
in addition  the senior credit facility has restrictions pertaining to capital expenditures  acquisitions and the payment of cash dividends 
in particular  the covenants limit our acquisition spending  without a waiver  to million for the period from may  to december  and million per year thereafter plus up to million of any unused amount from the previous year 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants  including the two covenant ratios  the fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio 
the senior credit facility defines the fixed charge coverage ratio as that ratio that is calculated on a last month basis by dividing pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined by the agreement  by fixed charges 
pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization include months of operating results for businesses acquired during the period 
fixed charges are defined as cash interest expense  scheduled principal payments on debt obligations  capital expenditures  and provision for income taxes 
at december   we had a fixed charge coverage ratio of to  which was in compliance with the required ratio of no less than to 
the senior credit facility defines the leverage ratio as that ratio which is calculated as total debt divided by pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined by the agreement 
at december   we had a leverage ratio of to  which was in compliance with the required ratio of no more than to 
interest rate hedging agreements we have swap agreements whereby we pay counterparties amounts based on fixed interest rates and set notional principal amounts in exchange for the receipt of payments from the counterparties based on london interbank offer rates  or libor  and the same set notional principal amounts 
a summary of the agreements existing at december  is as follows fixed interest rate notional amount million million million effective date expiration date counterparties goldman sachs wells fargo wells fargo qualifies for hedge accounting yes yes yes 
table of contents we entered into these swap agreements to hedge against the risk of increasing interest rates 
the contracts effectively convert a certain amount of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility to fixed rate debt for purposes of controlling cash paid for interest 
that amount is equal to the notional principal amount of the swap agreements  and the fixed rate conversion period is equal to the terms of the contract 
the impact of these swap agreements has been factored into our future contractual cash requirements table above 
in the future  we may enter into additional interest rate strategies to take advantage of favorable current rate environments 
we have not yet determined what those strategies will be or their possible impact

new accounting pronouncements inventory costs in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  effective for fiscal years beginning after june   to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material or spoilage that may be incurred

share based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r will require us to measure the cost of share based payments to employees  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value and to recognize the cost over the requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  depending on the number of options granted and the assumptions used to value those options  the adoption of sfas no 
r could have a material impact on our operating results 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  defining and changing the way companies account for changes in accounting principles  accounting estimates and reporting entities  as well as corrections of errors 
among other things  sfas no 
prohibits companies from changing accounting principles or the methodology of applying accounting principles unless directed to do so by new accounting principles or unless the new principle or application is acceptable and superior 

table of contents entities changing accounting principles outside of specific guidance are required to retroactively apply the change to all prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so  in which case  entities will be required to make an adjustment to retained earnings in the year of change 
we do not anticipate that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our future operations  however  its application could result in a change in historically reported financial statements if in the future we either adopt a new accounting principle where no specific application guidance is provided or if we change current accounting principles or the method of their application

on august   we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to stockholders of record as of august  all per share information included in the above table for quarters prior to september  have been restated to reflect the effect of the stock dividend 
the quarters ended december  and include an adjustment to reflect changes in our weighted average state statutory tax rate due to a favorable shift in the number of facilities that we operated in states with lower tax rates or no state income tax 
although not readily detectable because of the impact of acquisitions  our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuation 
in particular  our laboratory and animal hospital revenue historically has been greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the demand for our veterinary services is significantly higher during warmer months because pets spend a greater amount of time outdoors  where they are more likely to be injured and are more susceptible to disease and parasites 
in addition  use of veterinary services may be affected by levels of infestation of fleas  heartworms and ticks and the number of daylight hours 
a substantial portion of our costs for our veterinary services are fixed and do not vary with the level of demand 
consequently  our 
table of contents operating income and operating margins generally have been higher for the second and third quarters than that experienced in the first and fourth quarters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had borrowings of million under our senior credit facility with fluctuating interest rates based on market benchmarks such as libor 
for our variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact earnings and cash flow 
to reduce the risk of increasing interest rates  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
currently  we are engaged in the following interest rate swap agreements fixed interest rate notional amount million million million effective date expiration date counterparties goldman sachs wells fargo wells fargo qualifies for hedge accounting yes yes yes these swap agreements have the effect of reducing the amount of our debt exposed to variable interest rates 
for the month period ending december   for every increase in libor we will pay an additional million in interest expense and for every decrease in libor we will save million in interest expense 
we may consider entering into additional interest rate strategies to take advantage of the current rate environment 
we have not yet determined what those strategies may be or their possible impact
