critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant policies are summarized in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item these policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and reflect practices appropriate to the company s businesses 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its policies and estimates  including those related to income taxes  pension and postretirement benefits  broadcast rights  goodwill and other intangible assets  self insurance liabilities  accounts receivable allowances and stock based compensation 
management has discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development  selection and disclosure of the critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
in addition  there are other items within the financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical accounting policies and estimates 
changes in the estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on the financial statements 
income taxes provisions for federal and state income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
taxable income reported to the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates often differs from pretax earnings because some items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for income tax purposes 
the company provides deferred taxes on these temporary differences in accordance with financial accounting standard fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
taxable income also may differ from pretax earnings due to statutory provisions under which specific revenues are exempt from taxation and specific expenses are not allowable as deductions 
the company establishes reserves for income tax when it is probable that one or more of the taxing authorities will challenge and disallow a position taken by the company in its income tax returns and the resulting liability is estimable 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include estimates of the potential taxes and related interest as deemed appropriate 
these estimates are reevaluated and adjusted  if appropriate  on a quarterly basis 
although management believes its estimates and judgments are reasonable  the resolutions of the company s tax issues are unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by the company 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item pension and postretirement benefits the company provides defined benefit pension  postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees under a variety of plans see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item 
accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires the use of several assumptions 
weighted average assumptions used each year in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits were pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations increase in future salary levels for expense increase in future salary levels for obligations long term rate of return on plans assets the company expects to use a long term rate of return assumption of in  consistent with the assumption 
the long term rate of return assumption is subject to change due to the fluctuation of returns in the overall equity and debt markets 
as of the date of this report  a decrease in the company s long term rate of return assumption would result in an million increase in the company s net pension expense 
in  the pension plans assets earned a return of approximately 
the company will use a discount rate of for expense in at dec 
 and dec 
  the company s prepaid pension asset included an unrecognized net actuarial loss of million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of this net actuarial loss resulted from the difference between the company s expected returns on plan assets and the actual losses on plan assets in and expected returns on plan assets were million and million in and  respectively  actual losses were million and million  respectively 
in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the actuarial loss will be recognized in net periodic pension expense over the estimated average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
the company s policy is to incorporate asset related gains and losses into the asset value used to calculate the expected return on plan assets and into the calculation of amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss over a four year period 
in december  the pension plan benefits for former times mirror non union and non newsday employees were frozen 
as a result of the plan freeze  a pretax curtailment gain of million million at publishing  million at broadcasting and entertainment and million at corporate was recorded

for purposes of measuring health care obligations at dec 
  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
on dec 
  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of act was signed into law 
the act resulted in a million reduction in the accumulated other postretirement obligations for prior service costs and a million reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
as of the date of this report  a change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in thousands increase decrease service cost and interest cost projected benefit obligation   the company plans to contribute million related to certain of its union and non qualified pension plans and million to its other postretirement benefit plans in expected future benefit payments the following benefit payments  which reflect expected future service  as appropriate  are expected to be paid in thousands pension benefits other postretirement benefits broadcast rights broadcast rights consist principally of rights to broadcast syndicated programs  sports and feature films and are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the total cost of these rights is recorded as an asset and a liability when the program becomes available for broadcast 
syndicated program rights that have limited showings are generally amortized using an accelerated method as programs are aired 
sports and feature film rights are amortized using the straight line method 
the current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for broadcast that are expected to be amortized in the succeeding year 
at dec 
 and dec 
  the company had broadcast rights assets of million and million  respectively

goodwill and other intangible assets the company periodically reviews goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer being amortized for impairment in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fas no 
 the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization must be based generally on fair values 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is allocated is determined using multiples of operating cash flows for purposes of analyzing goodwill for impairment 
the estimated fair values of other assets subject to the annual impairment review  which include newspaper mastheads and fcc licenses  are calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analyses 
the development of market multiples and cash flow projections used in the analyses requires the use of assumptions  including assumptions regarding revenue and market growth 
the analyses use discount rates based on specific economic factors in the publishing and broadcasting industries 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the company s control 
in the fourth quarter of  the company elected to early adopt the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force topic no 
d  which requires the use of a direct valuation method for valuing intangible assets  such as fcc licenses  and reviewing them for impairment 
historically  the company had been using a residual valuation method to review its fcc licenses for impairment each year 
a direct valuation method generally results in a lower valuation than does a residual valuation method 
the company performed an impairment review of its fcc licenses for the year ended dec 
 using a residual method 
no impairments were required as a result of the analyses performed in the effect of changing to a direct valuation method for the fcc licenses impairment review was a pretax charge of million million after tax 
the charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
upon the adoption of fas no 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company treated the intangible assets associated with network affiliation agreements as having indefinite lives and stopped recording amortization expense on these assets 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission provided guidance regarding their accounting position in this area indicating that network affiliation agreements should be amortized 
as a result  the company began amortizing these assets in the fourth quarter of using a year life 
the company believes the year life is representative of the remaining expected useful life of the network affiliation intangibles 
the provisions of fas no 
required the company to perform an impairment analysis at the time of a change in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset which was previously not being amortized 
no adjustment to the network affiliation intangible assets was required as a result of this impairment review performed in the fourth quarter of beginning in  the company no longer performs an annual test of the impairment of its network affiliation agreements under fas no 
 but will perform an impairment test if indicators of impairment are present  as required by fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company s goodwill and other intangible assets at dec 
 consisted of the following in thousands dec 
 gross amount accumulated amortization net amount intangible assets subject to amortization subscribers useful life of to years   network affiliation agreements useful life of years  other useful life of to years    total    goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization goodwill publishing  broadcasting and entertainment  total goodwill  newspaper mastheads  fcc licenses  tradename  total  total goodwill and other intangible assets  network affiliation agreements  net of accumulated amortization  include million related to fox affiliations and million related to wb affiliations

self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs and automobile and general liability claims 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted

the recorded liabilities for self insured risks totaled million and million at dec

  respectively 
accounts receivable allowances the company s accounts receivable are primarily due from advertisers 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition and generally collateral is not required

  the company s allowance for accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recorded because the exercise price of employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
on june   the company accelerated the vesting of certain stock options granted on feb 
 and feb 
  totaling million in each year 
unvested stock options awarded to the then current executive officers of the company on these grant dates  which aggregated million and million  respectively  were not accelerated at that time 
on dec 
  the company accelerated the vesting of all stock options granted on feb 
  totaling million 
also  on dec 
  the company accelerated the remaining unvested stock options granted to the current executive officers of the company on feb 
 and feb 
  totaling million in both years 
all other terms and conditions of the stock option grants remain unchanged 
in accordance with apb no 
and related interpretations  the acceleration of vesting of these stock options did not require accounting recognition in the company s income statement 
the exercise prices of the  and grants were  and  respectively  and the company s closing stock prices on the june  and dec 
 dates of acceleration were and  respectively 
the impact of the accelerated vesting was to increase pro forma stock based compensation by million  or million net of tax  in the accelerated vesting of these stock options was one of several actions the company has recently taken to reduce stock based compensation expense that will be recorded in future years with the adoption of financial accounting standard fas no 
r see discussion below 
over the last two years  the company has reduced the number of stock options granted by approximately 
also  beginning in  option grants have year terms  down from years for grants in previous years  and do not have a replacement option feature 
under fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fas no 
 compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
for purposes of the disclosure required by fas no 
 as amended by fas no 
 the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  pro forma stock based compensation  as calculated and disclosed under fas no 
 could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if the company uses different assumptions in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no
