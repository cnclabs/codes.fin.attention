item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks factors 
executive level overview trimble s foundation remains positioning technology 
we have augmented this technology with wireless communication and application capabilities in order to enable us to participate in a wider number of markets and to play a more central role in those markets 
our efforts to market these technologies can generally be characterized as falling into the categories of either end user markets or component markets 
the engineering and construction  field solutions  and mobile solutions segments can be broadly described as end user markets and the component technologies and portfolio technologies segments can be described as components markets 
in the end user markets we provide a value added solution to the end user 
typically this requires a solution that includes a hardware platform and customer support 
in the components businesses  we typically sell to another company that adds significant value and brings the solution to the end user 
the segments constituting the end user  solutions activities  make up over of our revenue 
the critical success factors in these businesses center around attaining a significant understanding of the end users needs  applying that knowledge to create highly innovative products  integrating those products into an effective system  and establishing a proficient global  third party distribution 
the components businesses require different characteristics to be successful 
the customer is typically an oem  system integrator  or other third party that integrates our components into a system 
to satisfy this customer group  our focus is on price  product functionality  and quality 
with recent product introductions we have begun to add higher functionality into our products in order to provide greater value and potentially capture higher average selling prices for our offerings 
worldwide applications for the product range from vehicle tracking to remote asset management  including by way of example monitoring and tracking of construction materials  truck trailers and off road equipment 
during we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 
reinforcing our position in existing markets generally  we believe that our markets provide us with additional  substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods 
in we continued to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels to realize these opportunities 
the acquisitions of pacific crest and apache provided us with additional hardware competencies and applications knowledge 
a number of new products like trimble s and machine control products strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 
extend our position in existing markets through new product categories we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenues by bringing new products to existing users 
a example was the introduction of ag gps steer system 
bring existing technology to new markets we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets  and positioned ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth 
our efforts in china  india  russia  korea and eastern europe all reflected improving financial results  with the promise of more in the future 
entered completely new markets in fiscal we acquired advanced public safety  inc aps  a software development company that provides mobile and handheld software products used by law enforcement  fire rescue and other public safety agencies 
with this acquisition  we plan to leverage our rugged mobile computing devices and fleet management systems to provide complete mobile resource solutions for the public safety industry 
the aps acquisition opens up a new vertical page segment in which we can offer public safety agencies complete mobile computing and resource management solutions 
in addition  we acquired mobiletech solutions  inc  a provider of field workforce automation solutions and that has a leading market position in the direct store delivery dsd market 
we expect the mobiletech solutions acquisition to extend our portfolio of fleet management and field workforce applications 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with us gaap 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are impacted by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue is reduced by a sales return reserve as described under allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
our shipment terms for us orders  and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center are typically fca free carrier shipping point  except certain sales to us government agencies which are shipped fob destination 
fca shipping point means that we fulfill the obligation to deliver when the goods are handed over  cleared for export  and into the charge of the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point 
if no precise point is indicated by the buyer  we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier s charge 
other international orders are shipped fob destination  which means these international orders are not recognized as revenue until the product is delivered and title has transferred to the buyer or fca shipping point 
fob destination means that we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon delivery  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 
revenue from purchased extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty support period 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when a sale involves multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
software revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition and statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and post contract customer support pcs 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate 
the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method  and revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 
page allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality  historical experience  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business 
the reserve for sales returns as of december  and december  included million and million  respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation our inventories  net balance was million as of december   compared with million as of december  our inventory allowances as of december  were million  compared with million as of december  our inventory is recorded at the lower of standard cost or market net realizable value 
we generally use a standard cost accounting system to value inventory and these standards are reviewed a minimum of once a year and multiple times a year in our most active manufacturing plants 
we perform an in depth excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes judgments and estimates occur in the calculation of income tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance decreased by million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal approximately  million  million and million of the valuation allowance at december   december  and january  respectively relate to the tax benefit of stock option deduction  which will be credited to equity if and when realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
goodwill impairment goodwill as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  we performed goodwill impairment tests at the end of the fiscal third quarter of and for each reporting unit and found there was no impairment of our goodwill 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal third quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant assumptions 
for goodwill  the annual impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit page including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers 
accounting for long lived assets including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments  or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties was million as of december   compared with million as of december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our warranty liability 
the warranty periods for our products are generally between one and three years 
selected military programs may require extended warranty periods up to years and certain nikon products have a five year warranty period 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and costs incurred by third parties performing warranty work on our behalf 
our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products  we indemnify other parties  including customers  lessors  and parties to other transactions with us  with respect to certain matters 
we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants  or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties 
these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by the company under these agreements were not material and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december  page stock compensation we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan 
accordingly  we do not recognize compensation cost for stock options granted at a price equal to fair market value 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we estimated the fair value of the options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  and determined the expense  net of related tax effects  that would have been included in the determination of net income if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards 
stock based compensation net of tax was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal for options granted prior to october   the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted on or after october   the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model 
similar to the black scholes model  the binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility  dividend yield rate  and risk free interest rate 
in addition  the binomial model incorporates actual option pricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option s contractual term 
for these reasons  we believe that the binomial model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the value calculated using the black scholes model 
below is a comparison of assumptions used in under each valuation model in fiscal average assumptions for q q fy using black scholes assumptions for q fy using binomial expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options after vesting years years note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the plans we operate  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the pro forma effects to reported net income and earnings per share for fiscal   and as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date 
investment in joint ventures we have adopted the equity method of accounting for our investments in the caterpillar and nikon joint ventures 
this requires that we record our share of the joint ventures profits or losses in a given fiscal period 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for joint venture accounting 
recent business developments xyz of gps  inc xyz on february   we acquired the assets of xyz of dickerson  maryland 
xyz develops real time gnss reference station  integrity monitoring and dynamic positioning software for meter  decimeter and centimeter applications 
the purchase of xyz s intellectual property is expected to extend our product portfolio of infrastructure solutions by providing software that enhances differential gnss correction systems used in marine aides to navigation  surveying  civil engineering  hydrography  mapping and geographic information system gis  and scientific applications 
page advanced public safety  inc aps on december   we acquired aps of deerfield beach  florida 
aps provides mobile and handheld software products used by law enforcement  fire rescue and other public safety agencies 
with the aps acquisition  we plan to leverage our rugged mobile computing devices and our fleet management systems to provide complete mobile resource solutions for the public safety industry 
aps will be reported within our mobile solutions business segment 
mobiletech solutions  inc on october   we acquired mobiletech solutions  inc of plano  texas 
mobiletech solutions provides field workforce automation solutions and has a leading market position in the direct store delivery dsd market 
we expect the mobiletech solutions acquisition to extend our portfolio of fleet management and field workforce applications 
mobiletech solutions performance is reported under our mobile solutions business segment 
apache technologies  inc on april   we acquired apache technologies inc of dayton  ohio 
apache is a leading developer of laser detection technology 
with the acquisition  we extended our laser product portfolio for handheld laser detectors and entry level machine displays and control systems  as well as our distribution network in the united states 
apache s performance is reported under our engineering and construction business segment 
pacific crest corporation on january  we acquired pacific crest corporation of santa clara  california  a supplier of wireless data communication systems for positioning and environmental monitoring applications 
the pacific crest acquisition has enhanced our wireless data communications capabilities in the engineering and construction business segment 
results of operations overview the following table is a summary of revenue  gross margin and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 
december  december  january  fiscal years ended dollars in thousands total consolidated revenue gross margin gross margin total consolidated operating income operating income basis of presentation we have a week fiscal year  ending on the friday nearest to december  which for fiscal was december  fiscal was a week year and fiscal and fiscal were week years 
as a result of the extra week in fiscal  year over year results are not exactly comparable 
thus  due to the inherent nature of adopting a week fiscal year  the company  analysts  shareholders  investors  and others will have to make appropriate adjustments to any analysis performed when comparing our activities and results in fiscal years that contain weeks to those that contain the standard weeks 
page revenue in fiscal  total revenue increased by million or to million from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to stronger performances across all our operating segments with the exception of component technologies 
the engineering and construction  field solutions and mobile solutions segments increased  and  respectively  compared to fiscal revenue growth within these segments was driven by new product introductions and increased penetration of existing markets 
both the engineering and construction and mobile solutions operating segments also benefited from the impact of the pacific crest  apache and mobiletech acquisitions 
in fiscal  total revenue increased by million or to million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to stronger performances in most of our operating segments driven by new product offerings and increased penetration of the markets we serve primarily engineering and construction and field solutions  expanded distribution and selective acquisitions primarily mobile solutions and portfolio technologies  as well as the positive impact of the weaker us dollar on revenues generated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
during the fiscal year  sales to customers in the united states represented  europe represented  asia pacific represented and other regions represented of our total revenues 
during the fiscal year  sales to customers in the united states represented  europe represented  asia pacific represented and other regions represented of our total revenues 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a major portion of our revenues 
no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in fiscal   and it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix  pricing  distribution channel used  the effects of production volumes  new product start up costs  and foreign currency translations 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was due to the success of our market segmentation strategy  higher service revenues  cost reductions  and introduction of higher margin products 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was due to changes in the mix of products sold  principally related to increased sales of lower margin nikon branded survey and construction products  our agriculture products  pricing pressure in our component technologies business which typically demonstrates increased unit volumes coupled with declining unit prices  the impact of the weaker us dollar on our non us manufacturing  and distribution costs 
because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors  current level gross margins cannot be assured 
operating income operating income as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase is driven by improvement in revenues  in gross margins  and greater leverage of operating expenses 
operating expenses represented of total revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal results by segment to achieve distribution  marketing  production  and technology advantages in our targeted markets  we manage our operations in the following five segments engineering and construction  field solutions  component technologies  mobile solutions  and portfolio technologies 
segment operating income loss is net revenue less operating expenses  excluding general corporate expenses  amortization of purchased intangibles  restructuring charges  non operating income expense  and income taxes 
page the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below

revenue growth was also attributed to the acquisitions for fiscal segment operating income increased as a result of higher revenues and increased sales of higher margin products 
page engineering and construction revenues increased by million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the relatively strong environment of fiscal continued into fiscal  resulting in continued robust demand for survey  machine control  and laser products 
in addition  the full year effects for nikon branded products contributed to the year over year increase 
targeted new product introductions  such as the servo driven total station  provided improved market penetration 
the weaker us dollar also contributed to increased revenues in this operating segment 
operating income increased at a higher rate than revenue growth due to greater operating leverage on expenses 
field solutions field solutions revenues increased by approximately million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal revenue increased primarily due to successful new products such as the aggps ez guide system and aggps ez steer system in our agriculture product line and as a result of higher demand for both automated and manual guidance products into the agricultural market in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
field solutions revenues increased by approximately million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal revenues increased primarily as a result of higher demand for both automated and manual guidance products in the agricultural market 
in particular  revenues were enhanced by the introduction of ez guide plus 
we saw increases in our gis product lines due to increases in our dealer and distributor business 
additionally  programs designed to expand our distribution channel by supplementing value added  solutions focused business partners to our traditional dealer profile were successful 
in addition  we saw improved results in europe and increased opportunities in china 
increases in this segment s operating income were primarily due to higher revenues 
component technologies component technologies revenues decreased by million or and segment operating income decreased by million or for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal revenues decreased primarily due to the decline in demand for our in vehicle navigation products as a result of changes in buying strategies among certain automotive manufacturers  and softness in the timing businesses 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the oem board business 
operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue and unfavorable product mix 
component technologies revenues increased by million or  while segment operating income decreased by million or for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal revenues increased primarily due to higher demand from vehicle navigation and tracking customers  partially offset by the decline in demand from wireless infrastructure customers 
the segment operating income decrease was primarily due to pricing pressures from the embedded and in vehicle navigation product lines  a less favorable product mix  and increased spending for development of new categories of products 
mobile solutions mobile solutions revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to increased subscriber growth  an increase in sales into the ready mix suppliers  and increased sales from our dealer channel as we continue to develop and extend this channel 
operating loss decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily attributable to an increase in revenues and increase in gross margins due higher recurring service revenue 
mobile solutions revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due primarily to increases sales into the construction materials market  higher dealer sales and a significant enterprise sale 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of tracernet to strengthen our presence in this segment 
the benefits of the integration were not fully reflected until the fourth quarter of fiscal and the full year impact of these activities were not realized until fiscal segment operating loss decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to increased revenues which was largely offset by increased expenses related to the integration of the tracernet acquisition 
page portfolio technologies portfolio technologies revenues increased by million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in revenue and operating income was primarily due to stronger performance in our applanix airborne business which was offset by an increase in marketing expenses related to our trimble outdoors initiative 
portfolio technologies revenues increased by million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in revenues and operating income were primarily due to the inclusion of full year results of applanix  acquired in july  and higher sales of our military and advanced systems products 
research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development r d  sales and marketing  and general and administrative g a expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended  and and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 
december  december  january  fiscal years ended in thousands research and development sales and marketing general and administrative overall  r d  sales and marketing  and g a increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year in the amount of million and increase in compensation of million 
all of our r d costs have been expensed as incurred 
cost of software developed for external sale subsequent to reaching technical feasibility were not considered material and were expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to sustaining engineering expenses and costs incurred related to new product development  continued investment in next generation technologies  and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately of revenues 
we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  but decreased as a percent of total revenues 
the increase was primarily due to advertising and promotion costs associated with the launch of new products of million  the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year of million  increase in travel expenses of million  increase in compensation of million and an increase million foreign currency transaction loss 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  but decreased as a percent of total revenues 
the majority of the increase was due to the increase in revenue  promotional programs associated with new products  and the foreign exchange impact on expenses in our non us operations 
we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide 
our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products 
page general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of million  increase in rent expense of million as we were making duplicate payments during our move to our new headquarters  the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year of million  and increase of million in patent expense 
this was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million and an increase of million foreign currency transaction gain 
spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately of revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of g a expenses from acquisitions  expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  and bad debt expenses of million 
other operating expenses restructuring charges restructuring charges of million  million  and million were recorded in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the charges in fiscal were primarily related to office closure costs due to integration efforts of the mensi acquisition 
the charges in fiscal were primarily related to severance costs due to the realignment of trimble mobile solutions inc while charges in fiscal were primarily related to our japanese office relocation due to the nikon trimble joint venture formation 
as a result of these actions  the headcount of the affected operations decreased by and in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of december   the remaining accrual balance of million is related to the office closure expected to be paid over the next several years 
in process research and development we recorded in process research and development ipr d expense of million related to acquisitions made in fiscal we did not record any ipr d expense in fiscal and fiscal at the date of each acquisition  the projects associated with the ipr d efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
the value of the ipr d was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies 
accordingly  the value assigned to these ipr d amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 
amortization of purchased and other intangible assets december  december  january  fiscal years ended in thousands amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of other intangible assets amortization of purchased and other intangible assets amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented of revenue in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal when it represented of revenue 
although we had acquisitions in the current fiscal year  amortization decreased due to the fact our spectra precision group intangibles were fully amortized in the second quarter of fiscal amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented of revenue in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal when it represented of revenue 
page non operating expense  net the following table shows non operating expense  net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below december  december  january  fiscal years ended in thousands interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss expenses for affiliated operations  net other income expense total non operating expense  net non operating expense  net decreased by million or during fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to a decrease in net interest expense of million as a result of the repayment of debt and interest earned on higher cash balances offset by a million write off of debt issuance costs relating to the credit facility  an increase of million in foreign currency transaction gain and a million decrease in expenses for affiliated operations as a result of increased profits from our joint ventures and recognition of the remaining deferred gain from the caterpillar joint venture 
this was partially offset by a decrease in other income primarily due to the absence of a non recurring gain in investments of approximately million in fiscal year expenses for affiliated operation decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the recognition of the remaining million deferred gain related to the caterpillar joint venture 
since the joint venture is now profitable on a sustainable basis  future operating losses are not anticipated and there are no future outstanding financial obligations by us to the joint venture  we recognized the gain 
this amount was offset by an increased impact from the incremental transfer pricing effects due to growth in our construction product sales of million 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding joint ventures 
furthermore  we recorded our share of profits in the caterpillar joint venture which increased by million 
this was partially offset by a decrease in our share of profits in our nikon trimble joint venture of million 
non operating expense  net decreased by million or during fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to lower interest expense after the repayment of the principal balance of a subordinated note in june  the write off of million of debt issuance costs as a result of our debt refinancing in june and million related to the write off of the remaining unamortized portion of the warrants issued to spectra physics holdings usa  inc the increases in expense for affiliated operations were primarily due to our higher construction machine control revenues which led to increased impact from the pricing effects of transactions between us and the caterpillar joint venture 
this was partially offset by an increase of million related to our share of profits in the nikon trimble joint venture 
the increase in other income expense was primarily due to a net gain related to the sale of an investment 
income tax provision our effective income tax rates for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the and income tax rates are less than the us federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the realization of benefits from net operating losses and other previously reserved deferred tax assets 
our income tax rate is less than us federal statutory rate  primarily due to the benefit from the us incentive repatriation of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings provided by the american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings 
the american jobs creation act of the act provides for a special one time elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to of the eligible distribution
