item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
our business the kroger co 
was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nation s largest retailers  operating  stores under two dozen banners including kroger  ralphs  fred meyer  food less  king soopers  smith s  fry s  fry s marketplace  dillons  qfc and city market 
of these stores  had fuel centers 
the company also operates convenience stores and fine jewelry stores 
kroger operates manufacturing plants  primarily bakeries and dairies  which supply approximately of the corporate brand units sold in the company s retail outlets 
our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores 
we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers 
such costs include procurement and distribution costs  facility occupancy and operational costs  and overhead expenses 
the company s operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 
our performance the continued focus of kroger s associates on delivering improved service  product selection and value to our customers generated a year of significantly improved identical supermarket sales growth in the annual identical food store sales growth  without fuel  achieved in outpaced the identical sales growth achieved on the same basis in  and is a significant improvement over declining identical food store sales experienced in the fourth quarter growth was broad based and included all retail divisions and store departments 
through the fourth quarter of  we have achieved ten consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth  excluding supermarket fuel sales 
our internal analysis shows that we hold the or position in of our major markets 
we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores 
according to our internal market share estimates  which include all retail outlets including supercenters and other non traditional retail formats  kroger s market share increased in of these markets in  declined in and remained unchanged in three 
on a volume weighted basis  kroger s overall market share in these markets increased basis points 
kroger competes in major markets where supercenters have achieved at least a market share position 
kroger s overall market share in these markets rose more than basis points during  on a volume weighted basis 
our market share increased in of those markets  declined in seven  and remained unchanged in one 
these market share data illustrate that kroger continues to grow  despite an operating environment in the food retailing industry that continues to be characterized by intense price competition  aggressive supercenter expansion  increasing fragmentation of retail formats  and market consolidation 
kroger s retail price investments  combined with our service and selling initiatives led to these market share gains in we believe this growth can continue 
in our major markets  almost of the share in those markets is held by competitors without our economies of scale 
kroger has been able to balance its sales growth with earnings growth 
our net earnings increased to per diluted share in  from per share  excluding the effect of goodwill impairment charges  in we were not only able to leverage sales improvements to achieve earnings growth  but also offset investments in targeted retail price reductions and higher energy  credit card and pension costs with continued recovery from the labor dispute in southern california  as well as improvements in shrink  advertising  warehousing  and health care costs 
future expectations while we were very pleased with our results  we continue to develop our business model to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers 
our plan requires balance between sales growth  earnings growth and profitable capital investment 
we expect to achieve identical supermarket sales growth through merchandising and operating initiatives that improve the shopping experience and build customer loyalty 
we expect food store identical sales growth  excluding fuel sales  to exceed 
to the extent that these sales initiatives involve price reductions or additional costs  we expect they will be funded by operating cost reductions and productivity improvements 
we expect sales improvements and cost reductions  combined with fewer shares outstanding due to continued share repurchase activity  to drive earnings per share growth in kroger expects to deliver earnings per share growth in of approximately to 
this includes the effect of a rd week in fiscal  substantially offset by the expected effect of expensing of stock options  which we anticipate will reduce net earnings approximately per diluted share 
see recently issued accounting standards for additional discussion of the expensing of stock options beginning in in addition  on march   we announced that kroger s board of directors declared the payment of a quarterly dividend of per share 
the payment will be made june  to holders of record at the close of business on may  further discussion on our industry  the current economic environment  and our related strategic plans is included in outlook 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods  including goodwill and asset impairment charges and labor disputes in west virginia and southern california 
net earnings loss net earnings totaled million for  compared to a net loss totaling million in and net earnings totaling million in the increase in our net earnings for  compared to and  resulted from improvements in the southern california market and the leveraging of fixed costs with strong identical supermarket sales growth 
in addition  and were affected by goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively  as well as labor disputes in west virginia and southern california 
earnings per diluted share totaled in  compared to a net loss of per share in and earnings of per diluted share in net earnings were reduced by per share in and per diluted share in due to the effects of goodwill and asset impairment charges 
our earnings per share growth in resulted from increased net earnings and the repurchase of kroger stock 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our stock for a total investment of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of kroger stock for a total investment of million 
sales total sales in millions percentage increase percentage increase total food store sales without fuel total food store fuel sales total food store sales other sales total sales our total sales rose as a result of increased identical supermarket sales and square footage growth  as well as inflation in fuel and other commodities 
we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters 
differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage 
we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical supermarket sales 
our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below 
identical supermarket sales in millions including fuel centers excluding fuel centers including fuel centers excluding fuel centers we define a supermarket as comparable store when it has been in operation for five full quarters  including expansions and relocations 
we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales 
our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below 
comparable supermarket sales in millions including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers fifo gross margin we calculate first in  first out fifo gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus last in  first out lifo charge credit 
merchandise costs include advertising  warehousing and transportation  but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense 
fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 
our fifo gross margin rates were  and in  and  respectively 
excluding the effect of retail fuel operations  our fifo gross margin rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the growth in our retail fuel sales lowers our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales 
the declining rates on our non fuel sales reflect our continued investment in lower retail prices for our customers 
in  improvements in shrink  advertising and warehousing costs helped offset higher energy costs and our investments in targeted retail price reductions for our customers 
we estimate higher energy costs decreased our fifo gross margin rate on non fuel sales by basis points in operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative og a expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages  health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs 
among other items  rent expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and interest expense are not included in og a 
og a expenses  as a percent of sales  were  and in  and  respectively 
excluding the effect of retail fuel operations  our og a rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the growth in our retail fuel sales lowers our og a rate due to the very low og a rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales 
the declining rate on non fuel sales was primarily the result of our continued recovery in southern california  strong identical supermarket sales growth  labor productivity improvements  lower health care costs and million of settlement income related to a previous class action credit card lawsuit 
these improvements were partially offset by increased pension costs  credit card fees and incentive plan expenses  increases in reserves for certain legal matters  the writedown to fair market value of assets held for sale  and the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita 
we estimate higher energy costs increased our og a rate on non fuel sales by basis points 
rent expense rent expense was million in  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in rent expense reflects our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate 
the decline from was also affected by a decrease in charges for the net present value of lease liabilities recorded for store closings 
depreciation expense depreciation expense was  million   million and  million for  and  respectively 
the slight increase in depreciation expense in was the result of current capital expenditures of billion 
capital expenditures in and were billion and billion  respectively 
interest expense net interest expense totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense is the result of lower average borrowings 
during  we reduced total debt million from billion as of january  to billion as of january  interest expense in and included million and million  respectively  related to the early retirement of debt 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for and differ from the effective tax rate for due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill in and the effective income tax rates also differ from the expected federal statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes 
common stock repurchase program we maintain a trading plan under securities exchange act rule b to allow for our repurchase of kroger common stock  from time to time  even though we may be aware of material non public information  as long as purchases are made in accordance with the plan 
we made open market purchases totaling million  million and million under this repurchase program during fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition to this repurchase program  in december we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  including the tax benefit from these exercises 
we repurchased approximately million  million and million under the stock option program during  and  respectively 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in the decline in and was the result of our emphasis on the tightening of capital and increasing our focus on remodels  merchandising and productivity projects 
capital expenditures in included million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease 
the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage supermarket storing activity beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired acquired relocation closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims 
the liabilities represent our best estimate  using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods  of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january  case reserves are established for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as information becomes known 
the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
the difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers compensation liabilities was million as of january  for both workers compensation and general liability claims  we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
general liability claims are not discounted 
we are also similarly self insured for property related losses 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of million on a per claim basis 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
impairments of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred 
these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  an impairment calculation is performed  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores  to the carrying value for those stores 
if impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used  we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset s current carrying value 
we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows 
with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal  the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
we perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels 
generally  for reviews performed by local management  costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as operating  general and administrative expense 
costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets that result from corporate level strategic plans are separately identified in the consolidated statements of earnings as asset impairment charges 
the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows 
our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also upon the occurrence of trigger events 
the reviews are performed at the operating division level 
generally  fair value represents a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows  and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
projected future cash flows are based on management s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future 
if potential for impairment is identified  the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during  and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets  the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
intangible assets in addition to goodwill  we have recorded intangible assets totaling million  million and million for leasehold equities  liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases  respectively  at january  balances at january   were million  million and million for lease equities  liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription files  respectively 
leasehold equities are amortized over the remaining life of the lease 
owned liquor licenses are not amortized  while liquor licenses that must be renewed are amortized over their useful lives 
pharmacy prescription file purchases are amortized over seven years 
these assets are considered annually during our testing for impairment 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores 
the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to income in the proper period 
we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
however  the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets  inflation rates and general economic conditions 
owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
costs to reduce the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
inventory write downs  if any  in connection with store closings  are classified in merchandise costs 
costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 
post retirement benefit plans a company sponsored pension plans the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions  including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets  may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
the objective of our discount rate assumption was to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making this determination  we took into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plan 
our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the discount rate as of year end represents the equivalent single rate under a broad market aa yield curve constructed by our outside consultant  mercer human resource consulting 
we utilized a discount rate of for year end the basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january   by approximately million 
to determine the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories 
for  we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of  consistent with our pension plan s average return was for the calendar years ended december   net of all investment management fees and expenses 
our actual return for the pension plan calendar year ending december   on that same basis  was 
we believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return 
we have been advised that during and  the trustees plan to reduce from to the allocation of pension plan assets to domestic and international equities and increase from to the allocation to non core assets  including inflation linked bonds  commodities  hedge funds and real estate 
furthermore  in order to augment the return on domestic equities and investment grade debt securities during and  the trustees plan to increase hedge funds within these sectors from to 
collectively  these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets 
the trustees expect these changes to have little effect on the total return but will reduce the expected volatility of the return 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 
percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets in  we updated the mortality table used to determine average life expectancy in the calculation of our pension obligation to the rp projected to mortality table 
the change in this assumption increased our projected benefit obligation approximately million and is reflected in unrecognized actuarial gain loss as of the measurement date 
we contributed million  million and million to our company sponsored pension plans in  and  respectively 
although we are not required to make cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans during fiscal  we made a million cash contribution to our qualified pension plans on march  additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations 
we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
b multi employer plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements 
these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose 
trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions 
the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded  in accordance with gaap 
we made contributions to these plans  and recognized expense  of million in  million in  and million in we estimate we would have contributed an additional million in and million in  but our obligation to contribute was suspended during the southern california and west virginia labor disputes 
based on the most recent information available to us  we believe that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits 
we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets  ie  the amount of underfunding  as of december  because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans  we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger s share of the underfunding 
as of december   we estimate that kroger s share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was to billion  pre tax  or million to million  after tax 
this is consistent with the amount of underfunding estimated as of december  our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others  and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 
our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 
we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger 
rather  we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences 
we expect our contributions to these multi employer plans will continue to increase each year  and therefore the expense we recognize under gaap will increase 
in  our contributions to these plans increased approximately over the prior year 
we expect our contributions to increase by approximately five percent in and each year thereafter 
the amount of increases in and beyond has been favorably affected by the labor agreements negotiated in southern california and elsewhere during and  as well as by related trustee actions 
although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers  increased contributions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered 
our estimate of future contribution increases takes into account the avoidance of those taxes 
finally  underfunding means that  in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds  we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability 
any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described 
the amount could decline  and kroger s future expense would be favorably affected  if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or favorable legislation 
on the other hand  kroger s share of the underfunding would increase and kroger s future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline  if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or adverse legislation 
deferred rent we recognize rent holidays  including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements  as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
tax contingencies various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  we record allowances for probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an allowance  is audited and fully resolved 
as of january   tax years through were undergoing examination by the internal revenue service 
the establishment of our tax contingency allowances relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results could differ  resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent that we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances  our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
stock option plans we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
accordingly  because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date  no stock based compensation expense is included in net earnings  other than expenses related to restricted stock awards 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards  consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are similar to those of sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant 
fair value of share based awards will be determined using option pricing models eg  black scholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
r to reduce net earnings by per diluted share during fiscal inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market 
in total  approximately of inventories for and  respectively  were valued using the lifo method 
cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at january   and by million at january  we follow the link chain  dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 
the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 
we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 
vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold 
in most cases  vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item  and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item 
when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item  vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and recognized as the product is sold 
in fiscal and  we recognized approximately billion and billion  respectively  of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs 
more than of all vendor allowances were recognized in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated  million of cash from operations in compared to  million in and  million in in addition to changes in net earnings  changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the amount of cash provided by our operating activities 
during  we realized a million increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities  compared to a and million decrease during and  respectively 
these amounts are net of cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plan totaling million in  million in and million in the amount of cash paid for income taxes in was higher than the amounts paid in and due to higher net earnings 
in addition  the bonus depreciation provision  which expired in december  reduced our cash taxes in and this benefit reversed in this provision increased our cash taxes by approximately million in and reduced our cash taxes by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities was  million in  compared to  million in and  million in the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in and due to reduced capital expenditures 
refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 
net cash used by financing activities financing activities used million of cash in compared to million in and million in the increase in cash used by financing in was due to a decrease in long term debt issuances 
the increases in and over are primarily due to the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt 
debt management total debt  including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and financing obligations  decreased million to billion as of year end from billion as of year end total debt decreased million to billion as of year end from billion as of year end the decreases were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt 
our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt  pursuant to sfas no 
we had prefunded employee benefit costs of million at year end  and the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by million  million and million as of year end  and  respectively 
factors affecting liquidity we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately million under our f p a rated commercial paper cp program 
these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities 
we have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all cp amounts outstanding 
if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbb baa bbb  the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating 
this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities  under which we believe we have sufficient capacity 
borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program  depending on the current interest rate environment 
however  in the event of a ratings decline  we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie  in excess of days 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 
our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants 
a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities 
these financial covenants and ratios are described below our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio declined to below to  the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 
the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would be similarly affected by a one level downgrade in our credit rating 
our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio exceeded to  we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired 
our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio fell below to  we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired 
consolidated ebitda  as defined in our credit facilities  includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses 
our credit agreements are more particularly described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  based on year of maturity or settlement  as of january  in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations charitable contributions minimum contributions to company sponsored pension plans low income housing obligations financed lease obligations construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments credit facilities standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january  applicable to kroger s variable interest debt instruments  excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the short term nature of these borrowings  and stated fixed interest rates for all other debt instruments 
although we are not required to make cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans during fiscal  we made a million cash contribution to our qualified pension plans on march  additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations 
we expect any elective contributions made during will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
at this time  it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for and beyond 
our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction 
these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 
any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of january   we maintained a five year revolving credit facility totaling billion  which terminates in in addition  we maintained a million five year credit facility that terminates in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and commercial paper borrowings  and some outstanding letters of credit  reduce funds available under the credit facilities 
in addition to the credit facilities  we maintain a million money market line  borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facilities 
the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates  usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 
as of january   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreements and commercial paper program 
we had no borrowings under the money market line as of january  the outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facilities totaled million as of january  in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of january   we had available for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and declared effective on december  we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures  and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs 
however  we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds 
although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly effect our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facilities 
most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co 
and some of its subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of three real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with ownership 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness  should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january   it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available to us  we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses  including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities 
in addition to the above  we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business 
such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger  indemnities related to the sale of our securities  indemnities of directors  officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work  and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans 
while kroger s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  we are aware of no current matter that we expect to result in a material liability recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are similar to those of sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant 
fair value of share based awards will be determined using option pricing models eg black scholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards 
compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we are accounting for share based compensation expense under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and are following the accepted practice of recognizing share based compensation expense over the explicit vesting period 
sfas no 
r will require the immediate recognition at the grant date of the full share based compensation expense for grants to retirement eligible employees  as the explicit vesting period is non substantive 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to reduce net earnings by per diluted share during fiscal in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies that inventory costs that are abnormal are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost 
sfas no 
provides examples of abnormal costs to include costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs and spoilage 
sfas no 
will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
further requires a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets to be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january  fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations was issued by the fasb in march fin provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity 
the interpretation requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin became effective during fiscal the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do no meet the quantitative thresholds 
eitf no 
concludes that operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds can be aggregated only if aggregation is consistent with the objectives and basic principles of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  the segments have similar economic characteristics  and the segments share a majority of the aggregation criteria listed in a e of paragraph of sfas no 
eitf no 
became effective for fiscal years ending after september   and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination 
eitf no 
requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition 
eitf no 
further requires that leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after  and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term  shall be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes the required lease periods and any renewal periods deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition 
eitf no 
became effective for our second fiscal quarter beginning august  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
fsp fas requires rental costs associated with building or ground leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
in addition  fsp fas requires lessees to cease capitalizing rental costs  as of december   for operating lease agreements entered into prior to december  early adoption is permitted 
the company was already in compliance with the provisions of fsp fas  therefore it had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected change in net earnings  identical sales growth  expected pension plan contributions  our ability to generate operating cash flow  projected capital expenditures  square footage growth  opportunities to reduce costs  cash flow requirements  and our operating plan for the future  and are indicated by words such as comfortable  committed  will  expect  goal  should  intend  target  believe  anticipate  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors t hat could cause actual results to differ materially 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 
we expect earnings per share growth of approximately in this includes the effect of a rd week in fiscal  which will be substantially offset by the expensing of stock options 
we anticipate the expensing of stock options will reduce net earnings approximately per diluted share 
we also expect earnings per share growth to be approximately  based on comparable week results for we expect identical food store sales growth  excluding fuel sales  to exceed in in fiscal  we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers 
we expect operating margins in southern california to improve slightly due to the continued recovery in that market  although we expect improvement in will be less than in we expect operating margins  excluding the effect of fuel sales  to hold steady in the balance of the company 
we plan to use  over the long term  one third of cash flow for debt reduction and two thirds for stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend 
we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition  as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels 
in addition  we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate  logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  and should reduce merchandising costs 
we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements 
we expect capital investment for to be in the range of billion  excluding acquisitions 
total food store square footage is expected to grow before acquisitions and operational closings 
based on current operating trends  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we expect that our og a results will be affected by increased costs  such as higher energy costs  pension costs and credit card fees  as well as any future labor disputes  offset by improved productivity from process changes  cost savings negotiated in recently completed labor agreements and leverage gained through sales increases 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately 
we will continue to evaluate under performing stores 
we anticipate operational closings will continue at an above historical rate 
we expect rent expense  as a percent of total sales and excluding closed store activity  will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate 
we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration  labor  shrink  warehousing and transportation 
these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 
although we are not required to make cash contributions during fiscal  we made a million cash contribution to our qualified pension plans on march  additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations 
we expect any elective contributions made during will reduce our contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
we expect our contributions to multi employer pension plans to increase at per year over the million we contributed during various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals 
these include we have various labor agreements expiring in  covering smaller groups of associates than those contracts negotiated in in all of these contracts  rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 
a prolonged work stoppage at a substantial number of stores could have a material effect on our results 
our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor disputes  industry consolidation  pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional competitors  our response to these actions  the state of the economy  including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities  stock repurchases  and the success of our future growth plans 
in addition to the factors identified above  our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales  the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing 
our operating margins could fail to improve if our operations in southern california do not improve as expected or if we are unsuccessful at containing our operating costs 
we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business  as well as in material litigation facing the company  and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable 
unexpected outcomes in these matters  however  could result in an adverse effect on our earnings 
the proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt  repurchase common stock or pay a cash dividend may be affected by the amount of outstanding debt available for pre payments  changes in borrowing rates and the market price of kroger common stock 
consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business  either favorable or unfavorable  cannot be foreseen 
rent expense  which includes subtenant rental income  could be adversely affected by the state of the economy  increased store closure activity and future consolidation 
depreciation expense  which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases  is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets  or the remaining terms of leases 
use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed 
our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws  the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses 
we believe the multi employer pension funds to which we contribute are substantially underfunded  and we believe the effect of that underfunding will be the increased contributions we have projected over the next several years 
should asset values in these funds deteriorate  or if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability  or should our estimates prove to be understated  our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated 
the grocery retail industry continues to experience fierce competition from other traditional food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses  including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements 
the competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales  thus reducing margins 
while we believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable  unanticipated actions of competitors could adversely affect our sales 
changes in laws or regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate  may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
general economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base 
since gasoline generates low profit margins  including generating decreased margins as the market price increases  we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase 
although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin  gasoline sales provide a positive effect on operating  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales 
our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired  and achieve operating improvements at those companies  will affect our operations 
our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
our expected square footage growth and the number of store projects completed during the year are dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities as well as the timing and completion of projects 
interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment  changes in the company s credit ratings  fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt  decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations that results in an increase in debt 
our estimated expense of per diluted share  from the adoption of sfas no 
r  requiring the expensing of stock options  could vary if the assumptions that were used to calculate the expense prove to be inaccurate or are changed 
the amount we contribute to company sponsored pension plans could vary if the amount of cash flow that we generate differs from that expected 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
additionally  increases in the cost of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers  our fifo gross margin and net earnings will suffer 
we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger s business 
we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in  contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
as of january   we maintained ten interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling approximately  million  to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
these agreements mature at varying times between july and january variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar london interbank offered rate libor 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 
as of january   other long term liabilities totaling million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements  offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt 
in addition  as of january   we maintained three forward starting interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling million  to manage our exposure to changes in future benchmark interest rates 
a forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates  including general corporate spreads  on debt for an established period of time 
we entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt in fiscal and accordingly  these instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges for our forecasted debt issuances 
two of these swaps have ten year terms  with the remaining swap having a twelve year term  beginning with the issuance of the debt 
the average fixed rate for these instruments is  and the variable rate will be determined at the inception date of the swap 
as of january   we had recorded other long term liabilities totaling million to reflect the fair value of these agreements 
during  we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges 
approximately million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt 
as of january   the unamortized balances totaled approximately million 
annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january  the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january  interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january  the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january  refer to notes  and to the consolidated financial statements expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate average notional amounts outstanding thereafter total fair value in millions interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales 
for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and  as a result  will require net settlement  the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 
some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging 
we sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into six derivative instruments to protect us from declining corrugated cardboard prices 
these derivatives contain a three year term 
none of the contracts  either individually or in the aggregate  hedge more than of our expected corrugated cardboard sales 
the instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these instruments are marked to market in our consolidated statement of operations in og a expenses 
as of january   an other asset totaling million had been recorded for the instruments
