table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results that are subject to important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see item a  risk factors 
overview description of company we are a development stage biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of biopharmaceutical products for the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system  or cns  disorders 
our current product candidate pipeline includes diagnostic and therapeutic programs based on proprietary technologies 
we are developing diagnostic agents in molecular imaging  and therapeutic drugs for axon regeneration  blockade of the dopamine transporter  or dat  and anti angiogenesis 
our programs target unmet medical needs in the diagnosis and treatment of parkinson s disease  or pd  the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  or adhd  the treatment of stroke and the treatment of certain ocular conditions 
at december   we were considered a development stage enterprise as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
as of december   we have experienced total net losses since inception of approximately  for the foreseeable future  we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as our management executes our current business plan 
the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december  will not provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for the next twelve months 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december  and our ability to control certain costs  including those related to clinical trial programs  preclinical activities  and certain general and administrative expenses will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through june we will therefore need to raise additional capital through one or more of the following collaboration  merger  acquisition or other transaction with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  or through a debt financing or equity offering to continue as a going concern 
we are currently engaged in collaboration  merger  acquisition and other related fundraising efforts 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in our collaboration  merger  acquisition or other fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in connection with our common stock financing completed by us in march  we agreed with the purchasers in such financing  or the march investors  that  subject to certain exceptions  we would not issue any shares of our common stock at a per share price less than without the prior consent of the purchasers holding a majority of the shares issued in such financing 
on march   the closing price of our common stock was 
the failure to receive the requisite waiver or consent of the march investors could have the effect of delaying or preventing the consummation of a financing by us 
if we are unable to raise additional capital we may need to reduce  cease or delay one or more of our research or development programs and adjust our current business plan 
our ability to continue development of our programs  including our phase iii program of altropane molecular imaging agent as a diagnostic for parkinsonian syndromes  or ps  the phase ii program of altropane molecular imaging agent as a diagnostic for adhd and our preclinical programs including those in axon regeneration  pd therapeutics and ocular therapeutics may be affected by the availability of financial resources to fund each program 
financial considerations may cause us to modify planned development activities for one or more of our programs  and we may decide to suspend development of one or more programs until we are able to secure additional working capital 
if we are not able to raise additional capital  we may not have sufficient funds to complete our phase iii clinical trials of altropane as a diagnostic for ps or the phase ii program of altropane as a diagnostic for adhd 

table of contents we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses  technologies and products that are complementary to our business 
we believe that a near term opportunity exists to take advantage of market dynamics and financing conditions in our sector that we believe could enable us to acquire on favorable terms select biotechnology and drug development companies that have sound technical foundations  strong technical leadership and shareholders amenable to change and further investment in the combined entity 
the consideration paid in connection with an acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  including options or other rights  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and restructuring charges 
they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests  which could result in future impairment charges 
to the extent that we use common stock for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid for future acquisitions  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
in order to effect an acquisition  we may need additional financing 
we cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on terms favorable or acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stockholders  who would then experience dilution 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or successfully complete any acquisitions 
product development molecular imaging program the altropane molecular imaging agent is being developed for two indications the differential diagnosis of ps including pd  and non ps in patients with tremor  and adhd 
we have completed an initial phase iii trial of altropane for use in differentiating ps movement disorders from other movement disorders 
in april  we reached an agreement with the food and drug administration  or fda  under the special protocol assessment  or spa  process regarding our protocol design for a new phase iii clinical trial of altropane designed to distinguish ps from non ps in patients with tremors 
this trial was designed to enroll a minimum of patients and required that the statistical significance of the results reach a p value of less than 
under the spa  interim analysis of trial data was not permitted 
patient enrollment in this trial was initiated in july and continued into in august  we reached agreement with the fda on a new spa providing for an amended phase iii program that specified two clinical protocols parkinson s or essential tremor  or poet  and a new protocol parkinson s or essential tremor  or poet this new spa permitted us to conduct two smaller phase iii trials and lower the statistical endpoint hurdle of the two trials from p to p 
the fda agreed to allow all subjects enrolled under the terms of the old spa to be retained for purposes of the new spa 
under the new spa  interim analysis of data was still not permitted 
publication of the results of poet prior to the completion of poet was also prohibited 
poet and poet were to occur sequentially 
the primary endpoint for poet is the confirmation that the diagnostic accuracy of the altropane molecular imaging agent is statistically superior to the diagnostic accuracy of the internist or general practitioner 
a diagnosis of a movement disorder specialist  was utilized as the gold standard 
based on certain statistical and modeling assumptions  we initially estimated that the poet trial would require enrollment of approximately subjects to meet the endpoints and be statistically significant 
after a series of discussions with the fda  in march  we notified the fda that we elected to terminate our spa and end poet enrollment so we could analyze the complete set of clinical data for efficacy 
no safety issues were identified in the trial 
based on the previous performance of altropane and our permitted monitoring of non blinded data from the approximately patients enrolled in the 
table of contents poet trial to date  statistical modeling indicated that poet may have already enrolled enough subjects in the trial to evaluate the efficacy of altropane 
we based our original plan for enrolling subjects in poet in part on published reports in scientific journals that indicated a to percent misdiagnosis rate in the early stages of pd 
our review of the data from subjects enrolled in the poet trial indicates that the error rate of general practitioners who participated in poet is much higher 
as such  the statistical modeling indicates that if the performance of altropane in poet is consistent with its historical performance in earlier trials  statistical significance may be achieved after enrolling slightly over half the originally planned number of subjects 
we expect to receive results of the data analysis during the third quarter of after review of the results  we will determine the future clinical development plan for the altropane program  including  but not limited to poet there can be no assurance that poet has achieved statistical significance 
we are currently in the process of assembling the necessary safety and clinical databases required as part of a new drug application  or nda  submission 
preparation and submission of an nda is typically a time consuming and costly process 
there can be no assurance that the trials will be successful  that we will have sufficient resources to complete and submit the nda  that we will be able to assemble the required information required for an nda submission  or that the fda will not request additional clinical trial data or other regulatory information before it will accept an nda submission for altropane 
we are currently analyzing the imaging results and the clinical data obtained from patients enrolled to date in our phase iib clinical trial using altropane molecular imaging agent for the diagnosis of adhd to ensure that the trial design and quantitation algorithms are appropriate for this patient population 
we are also collaborating with outside experts to validate and refine the algorithm used to interpret the scans to ensure consistent and reproducible results 
there can be no assurance that we will proceed with our phase iib trial  or if continued  that it will be successfully completed 
we are developing a technetium based molecular imaging agent for the diagnosis of pd and adhd 
our technetium based molecular imaging program is in the preclinical stage of development and we believe that we will submit an investigational new drug application  or ind  for our technetium based molecular imaging program during the fourth quarter of there can be no assurance that resources will be available to continue and complete the development activities being conducted  that the program will result in data that supports the continued development required to file an ind  or that we will be able to submit an ind during the fourth quarter of axon regeneration program inosine is a proprietary axon regeneration factor that specifically promotes axon outgrowth in cns neurons 
in july  we filed an ind application with the fda for the use of inosine to enhance motor functional recovery after stroke 
in september  we announced that we received a written response to our inosine ind filing from the fda 
in its response  the fda placed our phase i study on clinical hold pending the submission of additional pharmacology and toxicology data 
in august  we completed and submitted the results of certain studies requested by the fda 
in october  the fda informed us that we remained on clinical hold pending receipt of additional information from existing tissue samples and related data from preclinical studies performed at contract laboratories 
we are attempting to obtain the related data and assess if there are sufficient tissue samples of suitable quality to satisfy the additional fda requests 
assuming that we are able to obtain these necessary samples and data  we plan to complete our clinical hold response and submit it to the fda 
there is no assurance that the requested tissues and data remain available or that our response  when and if completed  will be adequate  that we will be taken off clinical hold or that other preclinical studies will not be required by the fda prior to initiating the phase i trial 
additional preclinical studies could result in additional costs and delays in our inosine program 

table of contents parkinson s disease therapeutic program we are developing a dat blocker for the treatment of pd 
we have identified several promising lead compounds 
our dat blocking program is in preclinical development and we believe that we will submit an ind for our pd therapeutic program during the first half of there can be no assurance that resources will be available to continue and complete the development activities being conducted  that the program will result in data that supports the continued development required to file an ind  or that we will be able to submit an ind during the first half of ocular therapeutic program our ocular therapeutic program is designed to leverage our intellectual property estate to derive value from alternative uses of our compounds already in development 
the overall objective with the program is to develop a sufficiently broad and deep set of in vitro and animal data to demonstrate to potential development and commercialization partners the potential utility of our compounds as therapeutics for important eye diseases and regeneration of damaged optic nerve axons 
there are two recombinant proteins under development within the ocular therapeutic program 
troponin i  or troponin  is being studied as a therapeutic to control abnormal new blood vessel formation angiogenesis in the eye 
control of such blood vessel growth is viewed as important in the treatment of wet age related macular degeneration  or amd  as well as potentially diabetic retinopathy 
the second protein is oncomodulin  or mdp  which is being tested to determine its potential utility to enhance axon regeneration after acute injury to the optic nerve and possibly glaucoma 
sales and marketing and government regulation to date  we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products and  with the exception of altropane  all of our technologies and early stage product candidates are in preclinical development 
our product candidates must undergo a rigorous regulatory approval process which includes extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy before any resulting product can be marketed 
the fda has stringent standards with which we must comply before we can test our product candidates in humans or make them commercially available 
preclinical testing and clinical trials are lengthy and expensive and the historical rate of failure for product candidates is high 
clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment which is a function of many factors 
delays and difficulties in completing patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times 
the foregoing uncertainties and risks limit our ability to estimate the timing and amount of future costs that will be required to complete the clinical development of each program 
in addition  we are unable to estimate when material net cash inflows are expected to commence as a result of the successful completion of one or more of our programs 
research and development following is information on the direct research and development costs incurred on our principal scientific technology programs currently under development 
these amounts do not include research and development employee and related overhead costs which total approximately  on a cumulative basis 
th quarter program year to date cumulative molecular imaging axon regeneration parkinson s disease therapeutic anti angiogenesis ocular therapeutic estimating costs and time to complete development of a specific program or technology is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could require 
table of contents additional clinical trials or other development and testing 
results of any testing could lead to a decision to change or terminate development of a technology  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing or funding by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs incurred by us could be substantially less than estimated 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage technologies due to the fact that there are generally less comprehensive data available for such technologies to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the cost and the date of completion for any technology that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty regarding the number of required trials  the size of such trials and the duration of development 
we are currently analyzing what additional expenditures may be required to complete the phase iii clinical trial program for altropane for the diagnosis of ps and cannot reasonably estimate the cost of this phase iii clinical trial program at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to marketable securities  research contracts  the fair value and classification of equity instruments and our lease accrual 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
marketable securities our marketable securities consist exclusively of investments in united states agency bonds and corporate debt obligations 
these marketable securities are adjusted to fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheet through other comprehensive income 
if a decline in the fair value of a security is considered to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to a new cost basis and the unrealized loss is removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary based on factors such as the significance of the decline  the duration of time for which the decline has been in existence and our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity 
to date  we have not recorded any other than temporary impairments related to our marketable securities 
these marketable securities are classified as current assets because they are highly liquid and are available  as required  to meet working capital and other operating requirements 
research contracts we regularly enter into contracts with third parties to perform research and development activities on our behalf in connection with our scientific technologies 
costs incurred under these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract or based on actual enrollment levels which we believe corresponds to the manner in which the work is performed 
clinical trial  contract services and other outside costs require that we make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end as the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 

table of contents fair value and classification of equity instruments historically  we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with our debt and equity financings 
we record each of the securities issued on a relative fair value basis up to the amount of the proceeds received 
we estimate the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model is dependent on a number of variables and estimates including interest rates  dividend yield  volatility and the expected term of the warrants 
our estimates are based on market interest rates at the date of issuance  our past history for declaring dividends  our estimated stock price volatility and the contractual term of the warrants 
the value ascribed to the warrants in connection with debt offerings is considered a cost of capital and amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt 
we have  at certain times  issued preferred stock and notes  which were convertible into common stock at a discount from the common stock market price at the date of issuance 
the discounted amount associated with such conversion rights represents an incremental yield  or beneficial conversion feature that is recorded when the consideration allocated to the convertible security  divided by the number of common shares into which the security converts  is below the fair value of the common stock at the date of issuance of the convertible instrument 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with the preferred stock is recognized as a return to the preferred shareholders and represents a non cash charge in the determination of net loss available to common stockholders 
the beneficial conversion feature is recognized in full immediately if there is no redemption date for the preferred stock  or over the period of issuance through the redemption date  if applicable 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with debentures  notes or other debt instruments is recognized as discount to the debt and is amortized as additional interest expense ratably over the remaining term of the debt instrument 
lease accrual we are required to make significant judgments and assumptions when estimating the liability for our net ongoing obligations under our amended lease agreement relating to our former executive offices located in boston  massachusetts 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we use a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of the liability 
we applied a discount rate of representing our best estimate of our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  and income from sublease rentals  including estimates of sublease timing and sublease rental terms 
it is possible that our estimates and assumptions will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability  and the effect of any adjustments could be material 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease amendment on at least a quarterly basis  until the outcome is finalized  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
results of operations year ended december  and our net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  our net loss attributable to common stockholders was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders totaled per share during as compared with per share during the increase in net loss in was primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses partially offset by a reduction in interest expense 
the decrease in net loss attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis in was primarily due to an increase in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  shares in  which was primarily the result of the private placements of common stock completed in march and september 
table of contents research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to a reduction in preclinical costs for inosine of approximately  associated with certain animal toxicology studies completed in this decrease was partially offset by higher clinical trial costs for poet of approximately  associated with increased enrollment  higher compensation and related costs of  and employee severance costs of approximately  we currently anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase over the next twelve months although there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
this expected increase is primarily related to costs associated with the assembly and preparation of our safety and clinical databases for altropane and preclinical costs for our axon regeneration  dat blocker and molecular imaging agent programs 
our current working capital constraints may limit our planned expenditures 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily related to higher compensation and related costs of approximately  due to increased headcount  higher employee severance costs of approximately  higher commercialization and communication costs of approximately  and certain lease costs of approximately  related to the lease at our former corporate headquarters 
the increase was partially offset by the absence of costs in associated with the settlement and standstill agreement  or settlement agreement  we entered into in june with robert gipson  thomas boucher  ingalls snyder  llc  or i s  and ingalls snyder value partners  lp as part of the settlement agreement  we paid  to i s as reimbursement for certain expenses and approximately  to our former chairman of the board of directors in connection with consulting and separation agreements 
we currently anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase over the next twelve months although there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
this expected increase is primarily related to costs associated with our commercialization and communication efforts primarily related to our altropane molecular imaging agent program and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of this increase is anticipated to be offset by a reduction in severance and lease costs associated with our former headquarters 
interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease in the period was attributable to the prepayment in november of the outstanding principal plus accrued interest on the convertible senior secured promissory notes  or notes 
the decrease was partially offset by non cash interest expense of approximately  incurred in february when we agreed to lower the exercise price of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock held by ingalls snyder value partners  lp  or isvp  in return for its immediate exercise in cash 
investment income was  during the year ended december  as compared with investment income of  during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances in accrual of preferred stock dividends and the modification of warrants held by the preferred stock holders was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  in december  we issued shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock  or series e stock  with a purchase price of  per share of series e stock which initially yielded a cumulative dividend of per annum with a potential increase to in june in february  we entered into agreements with the holders of series e stock  or the holders  whereby the holders agreed to convert their series e stock into common stock 
we agreed to pay a dividend of for each share of series e stock held by the holders that was converted and to lower the exercise price of the warrants held by the holders of series e stock from to 
we recorded a charge of  to net loss attributable to common stockholders under the black scholes pricing model in connection with the re pricing of the warrants 
we recorded a charge of  to net loss attributable to common stockholders during related to the accrual of preferred stock dividends as compared with  during 
table of contents at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately  for which a full valuation allowance has been established 
as a result of our concentrated efforts on research and development  we have a history of incurring net operating losses  or nol  and expect to incur additional net operating losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  therefore  we have provided a full valuation allowance for these assets 
in the event we achieve profitability  these deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expense  subject to limitations that may occur from ownership changes under provisions of the internal revenue code 
in and  we experienced a change in ownership as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
since our formation  we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which  combined with shareholders subsequent disposition of those shares  has resulted in two changes of control  as defined by section as a result of the most recent ownership change  utilization of our nols is subject to an annual limitation under section determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate resulting in an annual limitation amount of approximately  any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be subject to adjustment if the fair value of our net assets are determined to be below or in excess of the tax basis of such assets at the time of the ownership change  and such unrealized loss or gain is recognized during the five year period after the ownership change 
year ended december  and our net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders totaled per share during as compared with per share during the higher net loss in was primarily due to higher research and development  general and administrative and interest expenses 
the lower net loss attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis in was primarily due to the absence in of a preferred stock beneficial conversation feature and an increase in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  shares in  which was primarily the result of conversions of preferred stock into common stock in research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily attributable to higher preclinical costs for inosine of approximately  associated with certain animal toxicology studies and higher clinical trial costs for altropane of approximately  related to the initiation of our second phase iii trial 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily related to higher legal and consulting expenses of approximately  largely associated with the settlement agreement 
we also incurred corporate legal expenses of approximately  primarily in connection with the settlement agreement  including related litigation filed prior to execution of the settlement agreement 
this increase was partially offset by lower payroll costs in of approximately  due to lower headcount and lower patent related legal fees of approximately  interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes resulting from the beneficial conversion features recorded in fiscal in connection with our march private placement  the conversion price of the notes was reduced to per share in accordance with the anti dilution provisions of the notes creating beneficial conversion features of approximately  in june  we issued  in principal amount of notes for interest accrued through june  the  note was issued with a conversion price of which was below the market 
table of contents price of the common stock at the date of issuance resulting in a beneficial conversion feature of approximately  beneficial conversion features are recognized as a decrease in the carrying value of the notes and an increase in additional paid in capital 
during  we incurred approximately  in interest payable in cash on the coupon on the notes   in non cash interest primarily associated with the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes and  in amortization of debt issuance costs 
during the period  the notes bore an effective interest rate of approximately based on the fair value of the notes 
investment income was  during the year ended december  as compared with investment income of  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a realized loss in the period of approximately  as compared to a realized gain of approximately  in accrual of preferred stock dividends was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  in december  we issued shares of series e stock with a purchase price of  per share of series e stock which initially yielded a cumulative dividend of per annum increasing to in june liquidity and capital resources net cash used for operating activities  primarily related to our net loss  totaled  in as compared to  in the increase in is primarily related to higher general and administrative expenses in net cash used for investing activities totaled  in as compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in the increase in net cash used for investing activities principally reflects the decrease in restricted cash in and the purchase of marketable securities with the proceeds from the private placements  described below  net of the sales of marketable securities which were subsequently used to fund operations 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled  in as compared to cash used for financing activities of  in the increase in net cash provided by financing activities principally reflects the effect of the private placements described below and the payments of notes payable and preferred stock dividends paid by us in as of december   we have incurred total net losses since inception of approximately  to date  we have dedicated most of our financial resources to the research and development of our product candidates  general and administrative expenses and costs related to obtaining and protecting patents 
since inception  we have primarily satisfied our working capital requirements from the sale of our securities through private placements 
these private placements have included the sale of preferred stock and common stock  as well as notes payable and convertible debentures 
a summary of financings completed during the three years ended december  is as follows date net proceeds raised securities issued september million common stock march million common stock december million convertible preferred stock and warrants march million common stock in the future  our working capital and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development activities  the level of resources that we devote to the developmental  clinical  and regulatory aspects of our technologies  and the extent to which we enter into collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of approximately  and a working capital of approximately  the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available at december  will not provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for the next twelve months 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  
table of contents and marketable securities available at december  and our ability to control certain costs  including those related to clinical trial programs  preclinical activities  and certain general and administrative expenses will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through june we will therefore need to raise additional capital through one or more of the following collaboration  merger  acquisition or other transaction with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  or through a debt financing or equity offering to continue as a going concern 
we are currently engaged in collaboration  merger  acquisition and other related fundraising efforts 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in our collaboration  merger  acquisition or other fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in connection with our common stock financing completed by us in march  we agreed with the march investors  that  subject to certain exceptions  we would not issue any shares of our common stock at a per share price less than without the prior consent of the purchasers holding a majority of the shares issued in such financing 
on march   the closing price of our common stock was 
the failure to receive the requisite waiver or consent of the march investors could have the effect of delaying or preventing the consummation of a financing by us 
if we are unable to raise additional capital we may need to reduce  cease or delay one or more of our research or development programs and adjust our current business plan 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december   are approximately as follows payments due by period less than one one to three to five more than contractual obligations total year three years years five years operating lease obligations other contractual obligations total such amounts primarily include minimum rental payments for our office and laboratory leases in massachusetts and maryland 
we have office and laboratory leases that expire through in addition  we have an office lease that expires in for which we have entered into two sublease agreements covering the entire leased space 
total rent expense under all of our leases was approximately  for the year ended december  such amounts primarily reflect research and development commitments with third parties

we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
we may not have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore our future operating results or cash flows could be affected if we are required to sell investments during a period in which increases in market interest rates have adversely affected the value of our securities portfolio
