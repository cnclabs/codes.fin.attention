critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate held for investment real estate held for investment is carried at cost 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 requires that a property be considered impaired if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property 
if impairment exists  an impairment loss is recognized  by a charge against earnings  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the property 
if impairment of a property is recognized  the carrying amount of the property is reduced by the amount of the impairment  and a new cost for the property is established 
such new cost is depreciated over the property s remaining useful life 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over estimated useful lives  which range from five to years 
real estate held for sale foreclosed real estate is initially recorded at new cost  defined as the lower of original cost or fair value minus estimated costs of sale 
sfas no 
also requires that properties held for sale be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs of sale 
if a reduction in a held for sale property s carrying amount to fair value less costs of sale is required  a provision for loss is recognized by a charge against earnings 
subsequent revisions  either upward or downward  to a held for sale property s estimated fair value less costs of sale are recorded as an adjustment to the property s carrying amount  but not in excess of the property s carrying amount when originally classified as held for sale 
a corresponding charge against or credit to earnings is recognized 
properties held for sale are not depreciated 
investments in equity investees tci may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investment policies of certain of its investees 
those investees are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method  an initial investment  recorded at cost  is increased by a proportionate share of the investee s operating income and any additional investment and decreased by a proportionate share of the investee s operating losses and distributions received 
recognition of rental income rental income for commercial property leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease terms 
rental income for residential property leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis as lease terms are generally for periods of one year or less 
for hotel properties  revenues for room sales and guest services are recognized as rooms are occupied and services are rendered 
revenue recognition on the sale of real estate sales of real estate are recognized when and to the extent permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
until the requirements of sfas no 
for full profit recognition have been met  transactions are accounted for using the deposit  installment  cost recovery or financing method  whichever is appropriate 
when tci provides seller

index to financial statements financing  gain is not recognized at the time of sale unless the buyer s initial investment and continuing investment are deemed to be adequate as determined by sfas guidelines 
non performing notes receivable tci considers a note receivable to be non performing when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments 
any new note receivable that results from a modification or extension of a note considered non performing will also be considered non performing  without regard to the borrower s adherence to payment terms 
interest recognition on notes receivable interest income is not recognized on notes receivable that have been delinquent for days or more 
in addition  accrued but unpaid interest income is only recognized to the extent that the net realizable value of the underlying collateral exceeds the carrying value of the receivable 
allowance for estimated losses a valuation allowance is provided for estimated losses on notes receivable considered to be impaired 
impairment is considered to exist when it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
valuation allowances are provided for estimated losses on notes receivable to the extent that the investment in the note exceeds management s estimate of fair value of the collateral securing such note 
fair value of financial instruments the following assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of its notes receivable  marketable equity securities and notes payable 
for performing notes receivable  the fair value was estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar loans 
for non performing notes receivable  the estimated fair value of tci s interest in the collateral property was used 
for marketable equity securities  fair value was based on the year end closing market price of each security 
for notes payable  the fair value was estimated using current rates for mortgages with similar terms and maturities

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the principal reasons for the change in cash are discussed in the paragraphs below 
tci s principal sources of cash have been and will continue to be from property operations  proceeds from property sales  and the collection of mortgage notes receivable  borrowings and to a lesser extent  distributions from partnerships 
management anticipates that tci s cash at december   along with cash that will be generated in from property operations  will not be sufficient to meet all of tci s cash requirements 
management intends to selectively sell income producing real estate  refinance or extend real estate debt and seek additional borrowings against real estate to meet its cash requirements

management also anticipates funding ongoing real estate construction projects and the acquisition of new real estate from cash generated by property sales  debt refinancings or extensions  and additional borrowings

although operating income was higher in compared to due to increased income from residential properties  cash from operations was less in compared to due to higher spending on general and administrative expenses  advisory fees and net income fees and an increase in non cash gains from property sales and foreign currency transactions in compared to management believes that cash flow may decrease from property operations as a result of selling income producing properties 
management expects that funds from existing cash resources  selective sales of income producing properties  refinancing of real estate  and additional borrowings against real estate will be sufficient to meet tci s cash requirements associated with its current and anticipated level of operations  maturing debt obligations and existing commitments 
to the extent that tci s liquidity permits or financing sources are available  management intends to make new real estate investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in compared to million in cash from investing activities decreased in compared to due to higher amounts of notes receivable funding  significantly more spent on real estate acquisitions and lower proceeds from real estate sales 
these decreases were offset by less cash used for real estate construction and improvements and payments received from the advisor during instead of payments made to the advisor as in cash from investing activities increased in compared to due to higher proceeds from the sales of real estate and collections on notes receivable  reduced by increased spending on real estate construction and improvements and real estate acquisitions  and an increase in payments to tci s advisor

cash from financing activities increased in compared to due to higher proceeds from refinancing of notes payable  which was reduced by higher payments on notes payable and the repurchase of tci s common stock 
management reviews the carrying values of tci s properties and mortgage notes receivable at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
impairment is considered to exist if  in the case of a property  the future cash flow from the property undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment is considered to exist if it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
if impairment is found to exist  a provision for loss is recorded by a charge against earnings 
the note receivable review includes an evaluation of the collateral property securing such note 
the property review generally includes selective property inspections  a review of the property s current rents compared to market rents  a review of the property s expenses  a review of maintenance requirements  a review of the property s cash flow  discussions with the manager of the property  and a review of properties in the surrounding area

newly issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company  such as stock options  or b liabilities  such as those related to performance units  that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r  which is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using prescribed fair value based methods 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a a modified prospective method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date or b a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits companies to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company has decided to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date 
all of tci s options were fully vested as of the effective date  and tci has no outstanding options that were granted  modified or settled after the effective date  so additional compensation costs for previously granted awards will not be recognized 
in december  the company s board of directors cancelled the stock option plan  and at the present time  the company has no plans to offer additional stock options 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no

statement no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of tci 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus in eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights issue  which provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership 
issue states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s business and thereby preclude the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the partnership 
the adoption of issue by us for new or modified limited partnership arrangements is effective june  and for existing limited partnership arrangements effective january  we do not expect that we will be required to consolidate our current unconsolidated joint venture investments nor do we expect issue to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
at its june meeting  the eitf reached a consensus regarding issue no 
eitf  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
eitf is effective for periods beginning after june  the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of acquisition or purchase 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
inflation the effects of inflation on tci s operations are not quantifiable 
revenues from property operations tend to fluctuate proportionately with inflationary increases and decreases in housing costs 
fluctuations in the rate of inflation also affect sales values of properties and the ultimate gain to be realized from property sales 
to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  tci s earnings from short term investments  the cost of new financings as well as the cost of variable interest rate debt will be affected 
tax matters prior to the year  tci elected and in the opinion of management  qualified to be taxed as a reit as defined under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
during the third quarter of  due to a concentration in ownership  tci no longer met the requirements for tax treatment as a reit under the code 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk tci s future operations  cash flow and fair values of financial instruments are partially dependent on the then existing market interest rates and market equity prices 
market risk is based on changes in market rates and prices  and the effect of the changes on future operations 
market risk is managed by matching a property s anticipated net operating income to appropriate financing 
tci is exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced 
tci does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets 
tci s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by tci s capital markets department 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
tci s earnings are affected as changes in short term interest rates impact its cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt 
a large portion of tci s market risk is exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings 
the impact on tci s financial statements of refinancing fixed debt that matured during was not material 
as permitted  management intends to convert a significant portion of those borrowings from variable rates to fixed rates 
if market interest rates for variable rate debt average basis points more in than they did during  tci s interest expense would increase and net income would decrease by million 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on tci s borrowing cost 
the analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in tci s financial structure 
the following table contains only those exposures that existed at december  anticipation of exposures or risk on positions that could possibly arise was not considered 
tci s ultimate interest rate risk and its effect on operations will depend on future capital market exposures  which cannot be anticipated with a probable assurance level
