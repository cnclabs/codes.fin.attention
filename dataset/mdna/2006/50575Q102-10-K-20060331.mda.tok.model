relocation of offices in december  we entered into an agreement to sublet the remaining floor of our new york city office that we were occupying  commencing march  and for a term through the end of our lease period 
accordingly  the remaining leasehold improvements were written off 
in conjunction with the write off of leasehold improvements  a portion of the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off in the write off of unamortized leasehold improvements of  net of the write off of  of the  of unamortized deferred rent credit  resulted in a net charge of  which was recorded in our statement of operations in the balance of the unamortized deferred rent credit was equivalent to the fair value of the company s obligation with respect to the lease 
in february  we entered into an office sublease for our current location  east rd street  th floor  in new york city  with a term expiring on july  this new office space is for approximately  rentable square feet compared to the previous location  which was approximately  rentable square feet 
we determined to reduce the size of our offices to cut unnecessary operating costs and to better suit our current operations 
the decrease in the amount of space and the lower rent per square foot will reduce the future costs for our new york city office space by approximately  annually 
in august  we entered into an office lease for our current location in boca raton  florida  which occupancy commenced in february when we relocated from our previous boca raton office 
this new office space is for approximately  rentable square feet compared to the previous location which was approximately  rentable square feet 
the decrease in the amount of space and the lower rent per square foot will reduce the future costs for our boca raton office space by approximately annually 
settlement with ladenburg capital s new york city landlord in february  ladenburg capital entered into a settlement agreement with the landlord for its office space in new york city which ladenburg capital was forced to vacate during due to the events of september  the terms of the settlement with the landlord who had filed for bankruptcy reorganization provided for us to pay the landlord  and were approved by the bankruptcy court in march the settlement agreement provides for the termination of all ladenburg capital s liabilities under the lease in exchange for  in cash and the surrender by the landlord of ladenburg capital s letter of credit of approximately in february  ladenburg capital deposited  into escrow and the landlord relinquished the letter of credit 
ladenburg capital will liquidate the assets securing the 
table of contents letter of credit and deposit the remaining into escrow 
the lease  which  had it not terminated as a result of the events of september   would have expired by its terms in march  provided for future minimum payments aggregating approximately  payable per year from through and in the liability provided at december  was increased by with a corresponding increase in rent expense for the year ended december  to reflect the settlement agreement 
other financing activities in december  ladenburg received a  temporary cash subordination from one of our directors  dr 
phillip frost  to provide additional regulatory capital required for an underwriting participation 
upon completion of the underwriting during the same month  the  was repaid with interest at a fixed amount of conversion of new york stock exchange membership on march   the nyse merged with archipelago holdings  inc and formed nyse group  inc  a publicly traded securities exchange 
ladenburg elected to continue being a member the nyse 
in exchange for its nyse membership seat  ladenburg will receive in cash   shares of nyse group  inc common stock and a dividend of approximately the shares of nyse group  inc common stock are subject to a lock up period during which the shares may not be directly or indirectly assigned  sold  transferred  pledged  hypothecated or otherwise disposed 
the lock up period will expire in equal installments on the first  second and third anniversaries of the date of the merger 
the nyse group board of directors has the right to shorten the lock up period with respect to all or a portion of the shares subject to the lock up 
as of december   ladenburg s nyse membership was reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition at which represents its cost basis 
we will record a gain on the exchange in the first quarter of critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
clearing arrangements 
ladenburg does not carry accounts for customers or perform custodial functions related to customers securities 
ladenburg introduces all of its customer transactions  which are not reflected in these financial statements  to its primary clearing broker  which maintains the customers accounts and clears such transactions 
additionally  the primary clearing broker provides the clearing and depository operations for ladenburg s proprietary securities transactions 
these activities may expose ladenburg to off balance sheet risk in the event that customers do not fulfill their obligations with the primary clearing broker  as ladenburg has agreed to indemnify its primary clearing broker for any resulting losses 
we continually assess risk associated with each customer who is on margin credit and record an estimated loss when we believe collection from the customer is unlikely 
we incurred losses from these 
table of contents arrangements  prior to any recoupment from our financial consultants  of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
customer claims  litigation and regulatory matters 
in the normal course of business  our operating subsidiaries have been and continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our activities as a broker dealer  as an employer and as a result of other business activities 
in general  in addition to the litigation with the landlord discussed below  the cases involve various allegations that our employees had mishandled customer accounts 
due to the uncertain nature of litigation in general  we are unable to estimate a range of possible loss related to lawsuits filed against us  but based on our historical experience and consultation with counsel  we typically reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages assessed against us 
we have accrued  and  for potential arbitration and lawsuit losses as of december  and  respectively 
however  we have in the past been assessed damages that exceeded our reserves 
if we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims  or if we are unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against us from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly  our operating income would be reduced 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
september  events 
on september   terrorists attacked the world trade center complex in new york  which subsequently collapsed and damaged surrounding buildings  including one occupied by a branch office of ladenburg capital 
these events resulted in the suspension of trading of us equity securities for four business days and precipitated the relocation of approximately employees to ladenburg s mid town new york headquarters 
some of ladenburg s and ladenburg capital s business was temporarily disrupted 
we are insured for loss caused by physical damage to property  including repair or replacement of property 
we are also insured for lost profits due to business interruption  including costs related to lack of access to facilities 
in september  ladenburg and ladenburg capital settled their claim with the insurance carrier for a total of  the excess of the insurance reimbursement over the  receivable previously reflected in other assets  amounted to  which is included in other income in our statement of operations 
in addition  the insurance carrier agreed to reimburse ladenburg capital up to one third of any payment ladenburg capital makes to its new york city landlord in settling its obligation relating to the vacated premises  limited to in february  ladenburg capital entered into a settlement agreement with the landlord for its office space in new york city which ladenburg capital was forced to vacate during due to the events of september  the terms of the settlement with the landlord who had filed for bankruptcy reorganization provided for us to pay the landlord  and were approved by the bankruptcy court in march the settlement agreement provides for the termination of all ladenburg capital s liabilities under the lease in exchange for  in cash and the surrender by the landlord of ladenburg capital s letter of credit of approximately in february  ladenburg capital deposited  into escrow and the landlord relinquished the letter of credit 
ladenburg capital will liquidate the assets securing the letter of credit and deposit the remaining into escrow 
the lease  which  had it not terminated as a result of the events of september   would have expired by its terms in march  provided for future minimum payments aggregating approximately  payable per year from through and in the liability provided at december  was increased by with a corresponding increase in rent expense for the year ended december  to reflect the settlement agreement 
exit or disposal activities 
during the fourth quarter of  we early adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 a cost 
table of contents associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for operating leases  a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity shall be recognized and measured at its fair value when the entity ceases using the right conveyed by the lease the cease use date 
the fair value of the liability at the cease use date shall be determined based on the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
in may  ladenburg relocated approximately of its employees from its new york city office to its melville  new york office 
as a result of this move  ladenburg ceased using one of the several floors it occupies in its new york city office  and the net book value of the leasehold improvements was written off 
in september  ladenburg subleased this floor for the remaining term of its lease 
the fair value of ladenburg s obligation with respect to the lease was approximately  at inception of the sublease and approximated the balance of our deferred rent liability relating to such space 
accordingly  no charge to operations was required in connection with the sublease at the time of sublet 
the obligation with respect to this lease was re measured as at december  due to changes in the timing and amount of estimated cash flows  resulting in a credit to operations in the amount of in the third quarter of  ladenburg ceased using a portion of another floor of its new york city office 
accordingly  the related leasehold improvements were written off 
in conjunction with the write off of these leasehold improvements  the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off in the third quarter of the write off of leasehold improvements  net of accumulated amortization  and the write off of the unamortized deferred rent credit resulted in a net charge to operations of in november  ladenburg subleased the space through june   for a sub rental equal to its lease commitment with the landlord  through the sublease period 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sublet the remaining floor of our new york city office that we were occupying  commencing march  and for a term through the end of our lease period 
accordingly  the remaining leasehold improvements were written off 
in conjunction with the write off of leasehold improvements  a portion of the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off in the write off of unamortized leasehold improvements of  net of the write off of  of the  of unamortized deferred rent credit  resulted in a net charge of  which was recorded in our statement of operations in the balance of the unamortized deferred rent credit was equivalent to the fair value of the company s obligation with respect to the lease 
fair value 
trading securities owned and securities sold  but not yet purchased on our consolidated statements of financial condition are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized in our results of operations 
the determination of fair value is fundamental to our financial condition and results of operations and  in certain circumstances  it requires management to make complex judgments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  where possible 
if listed market prices are not available or if the liquidation of our positions would reasonably be expected to impact market prices  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider market and contractual prices for 
table of contents the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the fixed income and equity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting principal trading revenues 
the illiquid nature of certain securities or debt instruments also requires a high degree of judgment in determining fair value due to the lack of listed market prices and the potential impact of the liquidation of our position on market prices  among other factors 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we account for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expense on the timing differences between the tax basis and book basis of its assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax amounts as of december   which consist principally of the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and accrued expenses  amount to  after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained recurring operating losses  we have determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  expiring in various years from through the company s ability to use such carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be subject to future limitations attributable to the equity transactions that occurred in march see recent developments financing activities private financing that have resulted in a change of ownership as defined in internal revenue code section 
expense recognition of employee stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r  shared based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
that cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the service period  which would normally be the vesting period 
the effective date of sfas no 
r for us is january  as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options unless options granted have an exercise price below the market value on the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future

after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained recurring operating losses  management determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
the income tax rate for the and periods does not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates primarily as a result of unrecognized tax benefits from net operating losses

in addition  we had fewer senior bankers in compared to 
table of contents the  decrease in compensation expense was primarily due to the net decrease in revenues and various staff reductions

in addition  we had various staff reductions in the first and second quarters of and the second quarter of  and a decreased compensation arrangement for our new chief executive officer in april the  decrease in brokerage  communication and clearance fees is primarily due to the decrease in proprietary trading activities and the decreased amount of agency commission transactions in compared to the decrease in rent and occupancy net of sublease revenue was primarily due to the subletting of a floor of ladenburg s new york city office in september due to this sublet  our rent and occupancy expense will decrease by approximately  annually through the end of our lease  june  in the third quarter of  ladenburg ceased using a portion of another floor of its new york city office 
accordingly  the related leasehold improvements were written off 
in conjunction with the write off of these leasehold improvements  the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off in the third quarter of the write off of unamortized leasehold improvements of  net of the write off of the unamortized deferred rent credit of  resulted in a net charge to operations of we incurred an income tax benefit of in compared to an income tax expense of in  primarily due to the filing of certain state and local income tax returns on combined basis  which reduced our overall income tax liability

liquidity and capital resources approximately of our assets at december  are highly liquid  consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trading securities owned and receivables from clearing brokers  all of which fluctuate  depending upon the levels of customer business and trading activity 
receivables from broker dealers  which are primarily from our primary clearing broker  turn over rapidly 
as a securities dealer  we may carry significant levels of securities inventories to meet customer needs 
a relatively small percentage of our total assets are fixed 
the total assets or the individual components of total assets may vary significantly from period to period because of changes relating to economic and market conditions  and proprietary trading strategies 
ladenburg is subject to the net capital rules of the sec 
therefore  it is subject to certain restrictions on the use of capital and its related liquidity 
ladenburg s regulatory net capital  as defined  of  exceeded minimum capital requirements of by  at december  failure to maintain the required net capital may subject ladenburg to suspension or expulsion by the nyse  the sec 
table of contents and other regulatory bodies and ultimately may require its liquidation 
the net capital rule also prohibits the payment of dividends  redemption of stock and prepayment or payment of principal of subordinated indebtedness if net capital  after giving effect to the payment  redemption or prepayment  would be less than specified percentages of the minimum net capital requirement 
compliance with the net capital rule could limit the operations of ladenburg that requires the intensive use of capital  such as underwriting and trading activities  and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from it  which in turn  could limit our ability to pay dividends and repay and service our debt 
ladenburg  as guarantor of its customer accounts to its primary clearing broker  is exposed to off balance sheet risks in the event that its customers do not fulfill their obligations with the clearing broker 
in addition  to the extent ladenburg maintains a short position in certain securities  it is exposed to future off balance sheet market risk  since its ultimate obligation may exceed the amount recognized in the financial statements 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  were  as compared to for the period 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in receivables from clearing brokers of  in compared to an decrease of  in offset by an increase in securities sold  but not yet purchased of  in compared to a decrease of  in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of for the period 
the difference is primarily due to a decrease in purchases of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements during the period and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations during the period 
there was  of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   compared to of cash used in financing activities during the period 
the activity primarily represents the issuance of  of common stock and  of notes payable  net of the repurchase of  of common stock 
at december   we are obligated under several noncancellable lease agreements for office space  which provide for future minimum lease payments aggregating approximately  through  exclusive of escalation charges and have subleased vacant space under subleases which entitle us to receive rents aggregating approximately  through such date 
the obligation excludes the lease referred to in the following paragraph 
in addition  one of the leases obligates the company to occupy additional space at the landlord s option  which may result in aggregate additional lease payments of up to through june in february  ladenburg capital entered into a settlement agreement with the landlord for its office space in new york city which ladenburg capital was forced to vacate during due to the events of september  the terms of the settlement with the landlord who had filed for bankruptcy reorganization provided for us to pay the landlord  and were approved by the bankruptcy court in march the settlement agreement provides for the termination of all ladenburg capital s liabilities under the lease in exchange for  in cash and the surrender by the landlord of ladenburg capital s letter of credit of approximately in february  ladenburg capital deposited  into escrow and the landlord relinquished the letter of credit

in general  the cases involve various allegations that our employees had mishandled customer accounts 
we believe that  based on our historical experience and the reserves established by us  the resolution of the claims presently pending will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  although we typically reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages assessed against us  we have in the past been assessed damages that exceeded our reserves 
if we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims  or if we are unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against us from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly  our financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our liquidity position continues to be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash from operations and we continually re examine our capital needs to support our liquidity and capital base for the near term 
we have been forced to cut expenses in the past as necessary such as reducing the size of our workforce  subletting unnecessary office space as well as implementing other cost cutting procedures throughout our operations 
as a result of decreased revenues  we have continued to reduce expenses 
commencing in april  as part of our new business plan  we employed several new employees and in connection with their employment agreements  have committed to incur certain expenses to grow our asset management  wealth management and alternative investments areas of our business 
after reviewing our current operations and financial position  we believe we have adequate cash and regulatory capital to fund our projected operating activities through december  our overall capital and funding needs are continually reviewed to ensure that our liquidity and capital base can support the estimated needs of our business units 
these reviews take into account business needs as well as regulatory capital requirements of the subsidiary 
if  based on these reviews  it is determined that we require additional funds to support our liquidity and capital base  we would seek to raise additional capital through available sources  including through borrowing additional funds on a short term basis from our principal shareholders or from other parties  including our clearing brokers 
additionally  we may seek to raise money through a rights offering or other type of financing 
if we continue to be unable to generate cash from operations and are unable to find alternative sources of funding as described above  it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the table below summarizes information about our contractual obligations as of december  and the effects these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future years
