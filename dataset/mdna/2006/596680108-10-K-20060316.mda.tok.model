item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussions of the company s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview middlesex water company has operated as a water utility in new jersey since  and in delaware  through our wholly owned subsidiary  tidewater  since we are in the business of collecting  treating  distributing and selling water for domestic  commercial  municipal  industrial and fire protection purposes 
we also operate a new jersey municipal water and wastewater system under contract and provide wastewater services in new jersey and delaware through our subsidiaries 
we are regulated as to rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services in new jersey and for water services in delaware  as to the quality of water service we provide and as to certain other matters 
our tesi subsidiary commenced operations during as a regulated wastewater utility in delaware 
only our usa  usa pa and white marsh subsidiaries are not regulated utilities 
our new jersey water utility system the middlesex system provides water services to approximately  retail customers  primarily in central new jersey 
the middlesex system also provides water service under contract to municipalities in central new jersey with a total population of approximately  in partnership with our subsidiary  usa pa  we operate the water supply system and wastewater system for the city of perth amboy  new jersey 
our other new jersey subsidiaries  pinelands water and pinelands wastewater  provide water and wastewater services to residents in southampton township  new jersey 
our delaware subsidiaries  tidewater and southern shores  provide water services to approximately  retail customers in new castle  kent and sussex counties  delaware 
our tesi subsidiary provides wastewater services to approximately residential retail customers 
our other delaware subsidiary  white marsh  services an additional  customers in kent and sussex counties 
the majority of our revenue is generated from retail and contract water services to customers in our service areas 
we record water service revenue as such service is rendered and include estimates for amounts unbilled at the end of the period for services provided after the last billing cycle 
fixed service charges are billed in advance by our subsidiary  tidewater  and are recognized in revenue as the service is provided 
our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on four factors weather  adequate and timely rate relief  effective cost management  and customer growth 
these factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years 
operating results by segment the company has two operating segments  regulated and non regulated 
our regulated segment contributed and of total revenues  and and of net income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the discussion of the company s results of operations is on a consolidated basis  and includes significant factors by subsidiary 
the segments in the tables included below are comprised of the following companies regulated middlesex  tidewater  pinelands  bayview  southern shores  and tesi  non regulated usa  usa pa  and white marsh 
results of operations in compared to millions of dollars fiscal years ended december  non non regulated regulated total regulated regulated total revenues operations and maintenance depreciation other taxes operating income other income expense interest expense income taxes net income operating revenues for the year rose million  or over the same period in water sales improved by million in our middlesex system  of which million was a result of base rate increases that were granted to middlesex on may  and december   and million was due to increased consumption due to drier weather as compared to the prior year 
customer growth of in delaware provided additional water consumption sales  facility charges and connection fees of million  and higher base rates provided million 
new unregulated wastewater contracts in delaware provided million in additional revenues 
usa had reduced revenues of million as compared to the prior year period  due to our meter services venture completing its original contracts during december this decrease was partially offset by increased revenues for usa s linecaresm maintenance program of million 
all other operations contributed million of additional revenues 
while we anticipate continued organic customer and consumption growth among our delaware systems  such growth and increased consumption cannot be guaranteed 
our water systems are highly dependent on the effects of weather  which may adversely impact future consumption despite customer growth 
appreciable organic customer and consumption growth is less likely in our new jersey systems due to the extent to which our service territory is developed 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million or as compared to the same period in in new jersey  payroll and employee benefits costs increased by million 
water production costs for the middlesex system increased by million due to higher demand and increased unit costs for electricity  chemicals and residuals removal 
costs to operate the tidewater system increased million  and increases in our delaware employee base  general wage increases and higher costs associated with employee medical and retirement benefits increased costs by million 
costs for providing services under our contract with the city of perth amboy increased by million 
all other operating costs increased by million 
the costs of our meter services venture decreased million due to the completion of the original projects during december going forward we anticipate increases in electric generation costs by as much as beginning may  in delaware due to deregulation of electricity 
our pension and postretirement costs increased by million during and we expect these costs to increase by million in payroll and related employee benefit costs excluding pension and postretirement expenses previously discussed are also expected to be higher in these increasing costs  in addition to higher business insurance  required us to file for a base rate increase with the bpu for pinelands during and will require us to file for an increase with the psc for tidewater during we cannot predict whether the bpu or psc will approve  deny or reduce the amount of any request 
depreciation expense for increased by million  or  due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
as our investments in utility plant and operating expenses increase  we continue to seek timely rate relief through base rate filings as discussed above 
other taxes increased by million generally reflecting additional taxes on higher taxable gross revenues  payroll and real estate 
other income decreased million  primarily due to reduced allowance for funds used during construction afudc due to reduced capital spending as compared to the prior year 
interest expense increased by million  or  as a result of a higher level of long term debt  and higher average interest rates and increased weighted average short term borrowings as compared to the prior year period 
income tax expense based on our current year operating results was million  which was partially offset by million of tax benefits 
net income increased to million from million in the prior year  however basic earnings per share decreased from to 
diluted earnings per share decreased from to 
the earnings per share decrease was due to an increase in average shares outstanding as compared to the prior year period as a result of the sale of  shares of common stock on may   and shares issued under the company s dividend reinvestment plan during results of operations in compared to millions of dollars fiscal years ended december  amounts in millions non non regulated regulated total regulated regulated total revenues operations and maintenance depreciation other taxes operating income other income expense interest expense income taxes net income operating revenues for the year rose million  or over the same period in water sales improved by million in our middlesex system  which was primarily a result of base rate increases

our meter services venture provided million of additional revenues for completed meter installations 
new unregulated wastewater contracts in delaware provided million in additional revenues 
base rate increases for our pinelands system contributed million of additional revenues 
revenues from our operations and maintenance contracts decreased million due to scheduled reductions in fixed fees under the city of perth amboy contract 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million or 
in new jersey  payroll costs  employee benefits and corporate governance related fees increased costs by million 
source of supply and pumping costs for the middlesex system increased by million combined due to increased costs for electricity and purchased water 
costs to operate the tidewater system  as well as an increase in our delaware employee base  general wage increases and higher costs associated with employee medical and retirement benefits increased costs by million 
the costs of our meter services venture increased million due to completed installations 
the costs of our non regulated wastewater operations and maintenance contracts increased million due to additional contracts obtained during the year 
these increases were partially offset by million of reduced costs related to our city of perth amboy contract due to reduced water treatment costs and a decrease of million for water main repair costs in our middlesex system 
depreciation expense for increased by million  or  due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
other taxes increased by million generally reflecting additional taxes on higher taxable gross revenues  payroll and real estate 
afudc rose by million for the year  due to large construction projects in new jersey for the renew program and a new raw water pipeline 
other income increased million  primarily due the recognition of a gain on the sale of real estate that had previously been deferred pending the outcome of the middlesex rate case 
interest expense increased by million  primarily due to higher average long term borrowings as compared to the prior year period 
improved operating results in compared to led to higher income taxes of million  which was partially offset by million of tax benefits 
net income increased by to million from million in the prior year  and basic earnings per share increased from to 
diluted earnings per share increased from to 
the increase in earnings per share was impacted by the higher number of shares outstanding during the current year as a result of the sale of  shares of common stock in may outlook in addition to some of the factors previously discussed under results of operations in compared to  our revenues are expected to increase in from anticipated customer growth in delaware for our regulated water operations and  to a lesser degree  from growth in our regulated wastewater operations in delaware 
we received approval for an  or million base rate increase for our middlesex system in december and implemented the second phase of the settlement of our tidewater rate case in april  from which we expect to fully realize on an annualized basis in during  we also filed for a combined  or million base rate increase for our pinelands systems 
we expect a decision in the matter during the second quarter of we expect to file for a base rate increase for tidewater during revenues and earnings for will be impacted by the ultimate timing and outcome of the anticipated filing 
revenues and earnings will also be influenced by weather 
changes in these factors  as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs are the primary factors that determine the need for rate increase filings 
we continue to explore viable plans to streamline operations and reduce costs in all aspects of our business 
we have unique challenges in delaware  where customer growth continues to exceed industry averages 
part of this unique challenge is that our delaware operations are a combination of over stand alone production and distribution systems serving communities 
our new regulated wastewater operation commenced operations during fiscal due to the start up nature of this operation  we expect our expenses with respect to this subsidiary may marginally exceed its revenues in we expect our interest expense to increase during as a result of incurring a full year of interest expense on the approximately million of long term debt we financed during fiscal and higher expected average borrowings and interest rates on short term credit facilities in order to finance a portion of our capital expenditures during the coming year see liquidity and capital resources 
our strategy includes continued revenue growth through acquisitions  internal expansion  contract operations and when necessary  rate relief 
we will continue to pursue opportunities in both the regulated and non regulated sectors that are financially sound  complement existing operations and increase shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations are largely based on three factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  and customer growth 
the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in results of operations 
for  cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the timing of collection of customer accounts and payments to vendors 
these decreases in cash flows were partially offset by receipts of advance service fees and the timing of payments for interest and employee benefit plans 
the million of net cash flow from operations allowed us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures for the period internally  with the remainder funded with proceeds from equity issued under our dividend reinvestment plan and both short term and long term borrowings 
for  net cash flow from operations of million  which increased over due to improved profitability during the period and the timing of payments made toward prepaid expenses  materials and supplies  and employee benefit plans allowed us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures 
net proceeds from both short term and long term borrowings were used to fund the balance of those expenditures 
increases in certain operating costs will impact our liquidity and capital resources 
as described in our results of operations discussion  during we received rate relief for middlesex and tidewater 
we also plan to file for a base rate increase for tidewater in as a result of continued capital investment in delaware 
we also expect to receive a decision on the requested pinelands base rate increase in there is no certainty  however  that the bpu or psc will approve any or all of this or other future requested increases 
sources of liquidity short term debt 
as of december   the company has established revolving lines of credit aggregating million 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under these credit lines were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of that date  the company had borrowing capacity of million under its credit lines 
the weighted average daily amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit lines and the weighted average interest rates on those amounts were million and million at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
long term debt 
subject to regulatory approval  the company periodically finances capital projects under state revolving fund srf loan programs in new jersey and delaware 
these government programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the financial markets 
a portion of the borrowings under the new jersey srf is interest free 
we participated in the delaware srf loan programs during and expect to participate in the new jersey srf program for million 
during  middlesex closed on million of first mortgage bonds through the new jersey environmental infrastructure trust njeit under the new jersey srf loan program in order to finance the costs of a new raw water pipeline and our and renew programs 
the proceeds of these bonds and any interest earned are held by a trustee  and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
during  tidewater closed on a million loan with the delaware srf program and on a million secured loan with cobank  a financial institution specializing in loans to rural utilities 
the proceeds were used to fund the ongoing capital program in delaware 
substantially all of the utility plant of the company is subject to the lien of its mortgage  which also includes debt service and capital ratio covenants  certain restrictions as to cash dividend payments and other distributions on common stock 
the company is in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions 
common stock 
the company periodically issues shares of common stock in connection with its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
periodically  the company may issue additional equity to reduce short term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 
the company issued shares under its dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan at a discount for a six month period during this allowed the company to raise million through the plan during  an increase of million as compared to the prior year 
during  the company issued million of common stock  which included a common stock offering of  shares that was priced at in may 
the majority of the net proceeds of approximately million from the common stock offering were used to repay most of the company s short term borrowings outstanding at that time 
capital expenditures and commitments as shown in the following table  we expect our capital expenditures in  and to increase over the amount of million 
these increases are attributable to anticipated acquisitions and development for the tesi system and continued customer growth and service improvement requirements in our tidewater systems in delaware  where we spent million on utility plant in millions of dollars delaware water systems delaware wastewater systems renew program scheduled upgrades to existing systems total under our capital program for  we plan to expend million for additions and improvements for our delaware water systems  which include the construction of several storage tanks and the creation of new wells and interconnections 
we expect to spend approximately million for system additions and acquisitions for our delaware wastewater systems 
we expect to spend million for our renew program  which is our program to clean and cement line unlined mains in the middlesex system 
there remains a total of approximately miles of unlined mains in the mile middlesex system 
in  nine miles of unlined mains were cleaned and cement lined 
the capital program also includes million for scheduled upgrades to our existing systems in new jersey 
the scheduled upgrades consist of million for improvements to existing plant  million for mains  million for service lines  million for meters  million for hydrants  and million for other infrastructure needs 
to pay for our capital program in  we will utilize internally generated funds and funds available and held in trust under existing njeit loans currently  million and delaware srf loans currently  million 
the srf programs provide low cost financing for projects that meet certain water quality and system improvement benchmarks 
if necessary  we will also utilize short term borrowings through million of available lines of credit with several financial institutions 
as of december   we had million outstanding against the lines of credit 
going forward into through  we currently project that we will be required to expend approximately million for capital projects 
to the extent possible and because of favorable interest rates available to regulated water utilities  we will finance our capital expenditures under the srf loan programs 
we also expect to use internally generated funds and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
we also expect to sell shares of our common stock through a public offering in late or early tidewater is appealing a notice of violation regarding a plan of correction to a community water system to provide fire protection services with an estimated capital investment cost of between million and million 
should we not be successful in asserting our defense  over additional community water systems could be subject to similar corrective plans of action 
while we are unable to estimate the potential capital investment costs for these additional community water systems at this time  tidewater believes these expenditures would be subject to recovery in rates as set by the psc 
see item legal proceedings for additional discussion of this matter 
contractual obligations in the course of normal business activities  the company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
some of these items result in direct obligations on the company s balance sheet while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  which are disclosed in the company s underlying consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of december  millions of dollars payment due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt notes payable interest on long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations total guarantees usa pa operates the city of perth amboy s perth amboy water and wastewater systems under a service contract agreement through june  the agreement was effected under new jersey s water supply public private contracting act and the new jersey wastewater public private contracting act 
under the agreement  usa pa receives a fixed fee and a variable fee based on increased system billing 
scheduled fixed fee payments were million in and will increase over the term of the contract to million at the end of the contract 
in connection with the agreement  perth amboy  through the middlesex county improvement authority  issued approximately million in three series of bonds 
middlesex guaranteed one of those series of bonds  designated the series c serial bonds  in the principal amount of approximately million 
perth amboy guaranteed the two other series of bonds 
the series c serial bonds have various maturity dates with the final maturity date on september  as of december   approximately million of the series c serial bonds remained outstanding 
we are obligated to perform under the guarantee in the event notice is received from the series c serial bonds trustee of an impending debt service deficiency 
if middlesex funds any debt service obligations as guarantor  there is a provision in the agreement that requires perth amboy to reimburse us 
there are other provisions in the agreement that we believe make it unlikely that we will be required to perform under the guarantee  such as scheduled annual rate increases for the water and wastewater services as well as rate increases due to unforeseen circumstances 
in the event revenues from customers could not satisfy the reimbursement requirements  perth amboy has ad valorem taxing powers  which could be used to raise the needed amount 
critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
changes in these variables may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance provided in the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
in accordance with sfas no 
 costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded would be treated differently by the regulators in the future 
revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors and are not significant  are recorded upon approval of the amount by perth amboy 
pension plan we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all employees with more than  hours of service 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations has decreased from at december  to at december  to at december  lowering the discount rate by would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million in lowering the expected long term rate of return on the pension plans by from to would have increased the net periodic pension cost in by approximately million 
the discount rate for determining future pension obligations is determined based on market rates for long term  high quality corporate bonds at our december measurement date 
the expected long term rate of return for pension assets is determined based on historical returns and our asset allocation 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population participating in the pension plans 
recent accounting standards see note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of existing long term debt instruments will mature 
combining this amount with the million in short term debt outstanding at december   and applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings
