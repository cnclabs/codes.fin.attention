item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion and analysis contains certain statements that are not historical facts  including  among others  those relating to our anticipated financial performance for fiscal and our expected store openings 
such statements are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in item of this k under risk factors forward looking statements 
information included in this discussion and analysis includes commentary on company owned and franchised restaurant units  restaurant sales  same store sales  and average weekly sales volumes 
management believes such sales information is an important measure of our performance  and is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of the buffalo wild wings r grill bar concept and the overall health of the concept 
franchise information also provides an understanding of the our revenues as franchise royalties and fees are based on the opening of franchised units and their sales 
however  franchise sales and same store sales information does not represent sales in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to financial information as defined or used by other companies 
overview as of december   we owned and operated and franchised an additional buffalo wild wings grill bar restaurants in states 
of the system wide restaurants  of those restaurants are located in ohio 
the restaurants have elements of both the quick casual and casual dining styles  both of which are part of a growing industry 
our long term focus is to grow to a national chain of  locations  with annual unit growth in the next several years  continuing the strategy of developing both company owned and franchised restaurants 
our growth and success depend on several factors and trends 
first  we continue to monitor and react to our cost of goods sold 
the costs of goods sold is difficult to predict  as it ranged to quarter to quarter in and  mostly due to the price fluctuation in chicken wings 
we are working to counteract the volatility of chicken wing prices with the introduction of popular new menu items  effective marketing promotions and menu price increases 
we will continue to monitor the cost of fresh chicken wing prices  as it can significantly change our cost of sales and cash flow from company owned restaurants 
we also are exploring purchasing strategies to lessen the severity of cost increases and fluctuations  and are reviewing menu additions and other strategies that may decrease the percentage that fresh chicken wings represent in terms of total restaurant sales 
the chart below illustrates the fluctuation in fresh chicken wing prices from quarter to quarter in the last five years

average quarterly wing prices q q q q a second factor is our success in new markets 
there are inherent risks in opening new restaurants  especially in new markets  for various reasons  including the lack of experience  logistical support  and brand awareness in a new market 
these factors may result in lower than anticipated sales and cash flow for new restaurants in new markets 
in  we plan to develop company owned restaurants primarily in markets where we currently have either company owned or franchised restaurants 
we believe this development focus  together with our implementation of revised new restaurant opening procedures  will help to mitigate the overall risk associated with opening restaurants 
third  we will continue our focus on trends in company owned and franchised same store sales as an indicator of the continued acceptance of our concept by consumers 
we also review the overall trend in average weekly sales as an indicator of our ability to increase the sales volume  and  therefore  cash flow per location 
we remain committed to high quality operations and guest hospitality  as evidenced by the implementation of our new flexible service style in company owned and franchised restaurants 
our revenue is generated by o sales at our company owned restaurants  which represented of total revenue in food and nonalcoholic beverages accounted for of restaurant sales 
the remaining of restaurant sales was from alcoholic beverages 
the menu item with the highest sales volume is chicken wings at of total restaurant sales 
o royalties and franchise fees received from our franchisees 
we generate cash from the operation of our company owned restaurants and also from franchise royalties and fees 
we highlight the specific costs associated with the on going operation of our company owned restaurants in the statement of earnings under restaurant operating costs 
nearly all of our depreciation expense relates to assets used by our company owned restaurants 
preopening costs are those costs associated with opening new company owned restaurants and will vary annually based on the number of new locations opened 
restaurant closures and impairment expense is related to company owned restaurants  and includes the write down of under performing locations  the costs associated with closures of locations and normal asset retirements 
certain other expenses  such as general and administrative  relate to both company owned restaurant and franchising operations 
as a growing company  we review our trend in general and administrative expenses  and are focused on reducing this expense as a percentage of revenue 
we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
each of the fiscal years in the five years ended december  were week years 
our fiscal will be a week year 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following discussion represents our more critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although it is not inclusive 
valuation of long lived assets and store closing reserves we review long lived assets quarterly to determine if the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is at the individual restaurant level 
in the absence of extraordinary circumstances  restaurants are included in the impairment analysis after they have been open for months 
we evaluate the recoverability of a restaurant s long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures over its remaining lease term  after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements  marketing programs  and anticipated changes in the trade area 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value based on our estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
during fiscal   and  we recognized   and million  respectively  of asset impairment charges 
in addition to the valuation of long lived assets  we also record a store closing reserve when a restaurant is abandoned 
the store closing reserve is subject to significant judgment as accruals are made for lease payments on abandoned leased facilities 
many factors  including the local business environment  other available lease sites  and the willingness of lessors to negotiate lease buyouts are considered in making the accruals 
we estimate future lease obligations based on these factors and evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the estimated reserve based on current market conditions 
during  we recorded a reserve of  which included charges of  for a restaurant closed in and an additional charge of  for the restaurant closed in the reconciliation of the store closing reserve for the years ended december   december   and december  is as follows as of as of dec

 provision incurred remaining lease obligation and utilities broker fees vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances and other funds received from vendors 
certain of these funds are determined based on various quantitative contract terms 
we also receive vendor allowances from certain manufacturers and distributors calculated based upon purchases made by franchisees 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction of the related expense 
amounts that represent a reduction of inventory purchase costs are recorded as a reduction of inventoriable costs 
we record an estimate of earned vendor allowances that are calculated based upon monthly purchases 
we generally receive payment from vendors approximately days from the end of a month for that month s purchases 
during fiscal   and  vendor allowances were recorded as a reduction in inventoriable costs  and cost of sales was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively 
revenue recognition franchise operations our franchise agreements have terms ranging from to years 
these agreements also convey extension terms of five or years depending on contract terms and if certain conditions are met 
we provide training  preopening assistance and restaurant operating assistance in exchange for area development fees  franchise fees and royalties of of the franchised restaurant s sales 
franchise fee revenue from individual franchise sales is recognized upon the opening of the restaurant when all our material obligations and initial services to be provided by us have been performed 
area development fees are dependent upon the number of restaurants granted in the agreement as are our obligations under the area development agreement 
consequently  as our obligations are met  area development fees are recognized in relation to the expenses incurred with the opening of each new restaurant and any royalty free periods 
royalties are accrued as earned and are calculated each period based on reported franchisees sales 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  and employee health benefits 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims that may have arisen but have not yet been reported to us as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  and claims development history 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit its total exposure for each of these programs 
significant judgment is required to estimate claims incurred but not reported as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
results of operations our operating results for  and are expressed as a percentage of total revenue below  except for the components of restaurant operating costs  which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales

in  due to the expensing of preopening rent  we expect the average preopening expense per restaurant to be  restaurant impairment and closures increased by million  or  to million in from  in on january   we concluded that we should recognize a million impairment loss with respect to certain assets of three under performing restaurants in atlanta 
no future cash expenditures are expected as a result of this impairment

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for new restaurant construction  remodeling and maintaining our existing company owned restaurants  working capital and other general business needs 
our main sources of liquidity and capital during the last three years have been cash flows from operations and the issuance of common stock through an initial public offering in november the cash and marketable securities balance at the fiscal year ended was million 
we invest our cash balances in debt securities with the focus on protection of principal  adequate liquidity and maximization of after tax returns 
as of december   nearly all excess cash was invested in high quality municipal securities 
we repaid all long term capital lease obligations and long term debt in december during fiscal   and  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accounts payable and income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts payable was due primarily to additional restaurants and the timing of payments 
the increase in income taxes payable was also due to the timing of payments

net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in unearned franchise fees  accounts payable  and accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and income tax receivables 
the increase in unearned franchise fees was due to a number of area development and franchise agreements sold but for which the restaurants had not yet opened 
the increase in accounts payable is relative to the growth in the number of company owned restaurants 
the increase in accrued expenses was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs resulting from company performance  higher professional fees resulting from sox implementation  and a higher gift card liability due to strong fourth quarter gift card sales

net cash used in investing activities for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
investing activities included purchases of property and equipment related to the opening of new restaurants in all periods 
in   and  we opened   and new restaurants  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately million in fiscal due to the addition of new company owned restaurants and the renovation and maintenance of existing restaurants 
in  we plan to open new company owned restaurants and to new franchised restaurants 
during  we began investing in marketable securities with maturities longer than days

our liquidity is impacted by minimum cash payment commitments resulting from operating lease obligations for our restaurants and our corporate offices 
lease terms are generally to years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance and other operating costs 
some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
except for one restaurant building  we do not currently own any of the properties on which our restaurants operate and therefore do not have the ability to enter into sale leaseback transactions as a potential source of cash 
the following table presents a summary of our contractual operating lease obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than after total one year years years years operating lease obligations      commitments for restaurants under development      total      prior to our initial public offering  we operated with a net working capital deficit utilizing our cash from operations and proceeds from equity financings and equipment leasing to fund our operations and our expansion 
since our initial public offering  we have maintained a cash and marketable securities balance in excess of million and have funded our capital expenditures from cash provided by operations 
we believe the cash flows from our operating activities in will also be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures for the current year 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fsp is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  fsp states that rental costs associated with operating leases must be recognized as rental expense allocated on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes the construction period

fsp provides accounting guidance for identifying and recognizing other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities  as well as cost method investments in addition to disclosure requirements 
fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and earlier application is permitted 
we will adopt this new pronouncement in our first quarter of fiscal the adoption of fsp is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

revised sfas no

sfas r will require us to  among other things  measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record the expense in our consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas r  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  are effective no later than the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after june  we will adopt the new requirements using the modified prospective transition method in our first fiscal quarter of  which ends march  under that method  we will recognize compensation costs for new grants of stock based awards  awards modified after the effective date  and the remaining portion of the fair value of the unvested awards at the adoption date 
in addition to the recognition of expense in the financial statements  under sfas r  any excess tax benefits received upon exercise of options will be presented as a financing activity inflow in the statement of cash flows rather than as an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented 
as sfas r applies to the calculation of stock based compensation for restricted stock units  beginning in the first quarter of  the value of our restricted stock units will be based on the fair value of the shares on the grant date instead of the fair value of the shares when vesting as the expense is now calculated 
based on our current analysis and information  management has determined that after adoption of sfas r  our total stock based compensation will be approximately million in quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth  by quarter  the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the two most recent years  as well as the same data expressed as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented 
restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the information for each quarter is unaudited and we have prepared it on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results 
all amounts  except per share amounts  are expressed in thousands 
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in same store sales  changes in fresh chicken wing prices  the timing and number of new restaurant openings and their related expenses  asset impairment charges  store closing charges  general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any future period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather  production  availability and other factors outside our control 
we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food product risks 
we negotiate directly with independent suppliers for our supply of food and paper products 
we use members of unipro food services  inc  a national cooperative of independent food distributors  to distribute these products from the suppliers to our restaurants 
we have minimum purchase requirements with some of our vendors  but the terms of the contracts and nature of the products are such that our purchase requirements do not create a market risk 
the primary food product used by company owned and franchised restaurants is fresh chicken wings 
we purchase fresh chicken wings based on current market prices that are subject to monthly fluctuation 
a material increase in fresh chicken wing costs may adversely affect our operating results 
fresh chicken wing prices in averaged lower than as the average price per pound dropped from in to in if there is a significant rise in the price of fresh chicken wings  and we are unable to successfully adjust menu prices or menu mix or otherwise make operational adjustments to account for the higher wing prices  our operating results could be adversely affected 
fresh chicken wings accounted for approximately   and of our cost of sales in   and  respectively  with an annual average price per pound of   and  respectively 
a increase in fresh chicken wing costs during  would have increased restaurant cost of sales by approximately million for fiscal additional information related to chicken wing prices is included in item under results of operations 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  and restaurant operating costs 
substantial increases in these costs could impact operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along through higher menu prices 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable federal and state minimum wages  and increases in the minimum wage rates could directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
during  we were affected by higher diesel and natural gas prices 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of municipal securities 
we do not believe there is a significant risk of non performance by these municipalities because of our investment policy restrictions as to acceptable investment vehicles
