item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a nationwide  high availability  multi vendor enterprise maintenance service and solutions provider for enterprises  including business  global services providers  governmental agencies and other organizations 
we have undertaken significant changes to our business in recent years 
after selling the operational outsourcing division in  we began the shift of our business to a predominantly services model 
in september  we completed the acquisition of alphanational technology services  inc and in august  we completed the acquisition of microserv  inc these acquisitions significantly expanded our geographic base  strengthened our nationwide service delivery capabilities  bolstered management depth  and added several prestigious customers 
on june   we sold our secure network services business 
we undertook this sale to leverage the valuations in federal government properties and to enable us to focus our resources and management on our core business of high availability maintenance services and technology deployment and integration services 
the proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness and provide working capital 
the sale of the secure network services business has improved our balance sheet 
see sale of secure network services business for more information 
we offer a growing list of services to businesses  global service providers  governmental agencies and other organizations 
our services are customized to meet each customer s needs providing xx service  personnel with required security clearances for certain governmental programs  project management services  depot repair and roll out services 
we believe the flexible services we offer to our customers enable us to tailor solutions to obtain maximum efficiencies within their budgeting constraints 
on september   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of alphanational in a merger transaction  for total consideration of approximately million  excluding the contingent earn out payment described below 
we acquired alphanational to increase our geographic coverage  expand the depth of management and increase the breadth of our product serviceability 
alphanational is an enterprise maintenance solutions company providing services to a national market place 
the merger consideration was comprised of cash in an amount equal to  and notes in principal amount of  after adjustment with an interest rate of per annum with a term of months  liabilities assumed of approximately  and  shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of million based upon a price of and fees and other related costs of approximately  the notes and accrued interest were paid in april  as a result of the sale of our secure network business during fiscal year  we utilized approximately million of our net operating loss carryforward 
at march  the remaining net operating loss carryforward was approximately million 
we incurred an operating loss for year ended march   primarily as a result of the costs incurred related to a large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract and a charge for impairment of goodwill 
the cost to service the large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract  including parts  labor and certain unanticipated service delivery costs exceeded our estimates when pricing the contract 
these costs were comprised of procurement and consumption of inventory  freight costs  increases in overtime and higher than anticipated usage of subcontractors 
we also experienced higher than anticipated failure rates on certain pieces of equipment  which contributed to the poor financial performance of this contract and operating results for the year ended march  and the contract was terminated on april  services revenues includes monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
revenues related to the fixed price service agreements are recognized ratably over the lives of the agreements 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
losses on contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the losses become determinable 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
this may result in a cash short fall that may impact our working capital and financing 
this may also cause fluctuations in operating results as start up costs are expensed as incurred 
see risk factors we incur significant costs in connection with the start up of new contracts before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls and fluctuations in quarterly results from period to period 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product sales are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
our goal is to return to and maintain profitable operations  expand our customer base of clients through our existing global service provider partners  seek new global service provider partners  and enhance the technology we utilize to deliver cost effective services to our growing customer base 
our ability to increase profitability will be impacted by our ability to continue to compete within the industry  and our ability to replace contracts which were sold in connection with the sale of the secure network services business 
we must also effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
we must continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  re engineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques  particularly within costs of services  selling  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
our future operating results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainties relative to national economic conditions and terrorism  especially as they affect interest rates  the reduction in revenue as a result of the sale of our secure network services business  industry factors and our ability to successfully increase our sales of services  accurately estimate costs when bidding on a contract  and effectively manage expenses 
we have streamlined our service delivery process  expanded our depot repair facility to repair rather than purchase new component parts and are working with our customers to modify the processes under which services are rendered to our customers 
we plan to effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
management must also continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  reengineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques 
the industry in which we operate has experienced unfavorable economic conditions and competitive challenges 
our operating results reflect the impact of this challenging environment 
we continue to experience significant price competition and customer demand for higher service attainment levels 
in addition  there is significant price competition in the market for state and local government contracts as a result of budget issues  political pressure and other factors beyond our control 
it has been our experience that longevity and quality of service may have little influence in the customer decision making process 
consolidated results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and and financial condition as of march  and we operate as a single business segment  whereby we provide high availability maintenance services  and technology deployment and integration for commercial and governmental clients 
as a result of the sale of secure network services business on june   the results of operations related to the secure network services business have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

services revenues include monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
amounts billed in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product held for resale are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
the components of revenues are as follows amounts in thousands march  change change revenues services product held for resale total revenues total revenues increased  or million  during fiscal year  to million compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we experienced growth in our high availability maintenance services as a result of the start up of several new contracts with services revenues increasing  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year product held for resale increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due to several large one time orders 
in addition  the revenues from the alphanational acquisition  which was completed on september   was included for the full year in fiscal year and in revenues in fiscal year from october  fiscal year total revenues increased  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year we experienced an increase in our high availability maintenance services and technology deployment revenue of  primarily due to the start up of a large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract and the inclusion of the revenues from alphanational in our fiscal year revenues 
product held for resale decreased by million  or  during fiscal year to million compared to million in the decrease in product held for resale in fiscal year was the result of intense competition in the product marketplace  a declining rate of orders and lower margins 
in fiscal year  we expect our services revenues to decrease as a result of the termination of a large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract which was not profitable and continued reductions in our product held for resale revenues due to on going price competition 
we expect the product trends to continue downward with many of the new products being offered at lower prices and with significantly lower margins 
cost of services included within cost of services are direct costs  including fringe benefits  product and part costs  and other costs 
a large part of our service costs are support costs and expenses that include direct labor and infrastructure costs to support our service offerings 
as we continue to expand our service offerings  we anticipate that the direct costs to support these service offerings will continue to increase in fiscal year  however  with the termination of an unprofitable large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract  we anticipate our over all costs to deliver services will decline 
on long term fixed unit price contracts  part costs vary depending upon the call volume received from customers during the period 
many of these costs are volume driven and as volume increases  these costs as a percentage of revenues increase  generating a negative impact to profit margins 
the variable component of these costs are product and part costs  overtime  subcontracted work and freight 
product is broken into two categories parts and equipment to support our service base and product held for resale 
part costs are highly variable and are dependent on several factors 
on long term fixed unit price contracts  parts and peripherals are consumed on service calls 
for installation services and seat management services  product may consist of hardware  software  cabling and other materials that are components of the service performed 
product held for resale consists of hardware and software 
cost of services consists of the following components amounts in thousands march  change change services delivery and support product held for resale total direct costs indirect costs cost of services cost of services increased in fiscal year  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year due to increased cost to deliver our services and increased product costs as result of increased revenues 
costs of services also increased in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due to the start up of the large nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract and the costs associated with the alphanational acquisition discussed above 
during fiscal year  our cost of services  delivery and support increased  or million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was partially due to an increase in salaries  overtime  and subcontracted services  and the inclusion of alphanational in our operations for the entire year in fiscal year in addition  the increase in services delivery and support was related to the costs associated with a large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract that was unprofitable 
other increased costs that are initially incurred at the start of a new contract that are difficult to measure  such as increased repair times due to becoming familiar with new product sets and higher call volumes which are inherent when one switches service providers  normally decrease over time and result in savings over the term of the contract 
the anticipated decrease in costs did not materialize 
we also experienced higher than anticipated failure rates on certain pieces of equipment  which contributed to the poor performance on this contract and operating results for the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  our cost of services delivery and support increased by million from million during fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in the cost of services delivery and support was primarily related to the startup of a large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  from which we incurred an operating loss 
after the successful implementation of the initial phase  the remaining roll out schedule was accelerated 
the costs associated with the accelerated roll out and certain unanticipated delivery costs were comprised of inventory  freight  costs to stage the inventory where strategically necessary  increased overtime and higher than anticipated usage of sub contractors that exceeded our estimates 
additional costs were also incurred as a result of the integration related to the acquisition of alpha national which was acquired on september  during fiscal year and  we continued to see pressure on gross margins on product held for resale due to the competitively priced product market experienced during these periods 
the costs of product held for resale increased  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased revenues 
during fiscal year  the cost of product held for resale decreased million to million from million in fiscal year due to decreased revenue 
the gross margin on product held for resale was  or in fiscal year   or in fiscal year  and  or in fiscal year total direct costs during fiscal year increased million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  as result of the increase in services delivery and support and increases in costs related to product held for resale 
total direct costs for fiscal year increased by approximately million  or  to million 
as discussed above  the increase in direct costs was due to increases in salaries and overtime costs related to the large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  partially offset by lower cost in product held for resale as a result of lower revenue volumes in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year indirect costs include costs related to operating our call center  logistics  dispatch operations  facility costs and other costs incurred to support the field service technicians and engineers 
indirect costs decreased  from million in fiscal year to million for fiscal year  a decrease 
the decrease in indirect costs was attributable to cost containment actions undertaken during the year 
during fiscal year  indirect costs increased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in indirect costs was attributable to several factors including the integration of alphanational with its related occupancy and associated payroll costs  and increases in travel  telecommunications and business insurance 
gross margin fiscal year and  gross margins were negatively affected by the increase in costs discussed above 
our fiscal year gross margin reflected the economic and competitive challenges we faced 
as a percent of revenues  the gross margin percent was for fiscal year  for fiscal year and for fiscal year  respectively 
although gross margins improved in fiscal year  when compared to fiscal years  our gross margins were negatively affected by continued higher than anticipated expenses associated with a large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract 
the reduction in gross margins in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  was the result of initial start up costs associated with the commencement of a the large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  higher delivery costs on new business  increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence and continued industry wide pricing pressures 
gross margins improved million  or  from fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of increases in revenue and improved profitability on existing contracts  however gross margins were negatively affected by the costs to deliver services on the large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contact 
gross margins decreased  or million in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year the decrease in gross margin in fiscal year was primarily related to the expenses associated with losses on a large  nationwide  enterprise maintenance contract 
this contract was terminated on april  we continue to work to increase revenues  continue in our cost reduction efforts and deploy technology to gain operating efficiencies in order to remain competitive 
we expect that the continued shift from product held for resale towards long term service contracts will have a positive effect on our gross margins over the long term  and for such margins to improve as we continue to increase our enterprise maintenance solutions base 
selling expenses selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel costs and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales 
selling expenses decreased  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily related to decreases in personnel costs and commissions and curtailed marketing efforts 
for fiscal year and  selling expense was million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non allocated overhead costs 
these costs include executive  accounting  contract administration  professional services  such as legal and audit  business insurance  occupancy and other costs 
general and administrative expense decreased  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year this decrease was a result of cost control efforts  including employment actions  and staff reductions  as a result of the sale of our secure network services business 
during fiscal year  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expense was the result of several factors  including increases in payroll and fringe benefits  outside services including legal  audit and professional fees  increases in occupancy costs related to the acquisition of alphanational  telecommunications expense  and depreciation expenses as a result of improvements made to our it infrastructure 
in spite of vigorous cost containment efforts  various factors  such as changes in insurance markets  related costs associated with complying with new securities and exchange commission regulations and the american stock exchange requirements may increase general and administrative expenses which will have a negative impact on our earnings in fiscal year and future periods 
goodwill impairment due to the sale of our secure network services business as well as losses resulting from continuing operations  we tested goodwill for impairment in advance of our annual testing date 
we tested our goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the resulting impairment loss was determined based on the applicable valuation methods  including the income and market approaches 
we completed our test for impairment and recorded a million non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill 
the charge is reflected as a component of operating loss in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
severance costs and abandonment of facilities during the year ended march   we recorded severance costs for employees working on several contracts that expired of approximately in conjunction with the acquisition of alphanational we conducted a review of our facility requirement and determined that after the completion of the acquisition we would have excess space 
during september  we recorded a charge for abandonment of facility of approximately  related to the sub leasing of rental office space 
we leased the excess space effective october  the abandonment charge was net of minimum sub lease rents of approximately  operating loss with the sale of our secure network services business  the financial operations of that business were recorded as discontinued operations for the year ended march   and  as a result  we incurred an operating loss of million compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended march  the operating loss for fiscal year was the result of on going losses in connection with the performance of an unprofitable large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract  which was terminated in april  severance costs  and an impairment charge for goodwill 
we incurred an operating loss of  in fiscal year compared an operating loss of million in fiscal year the operating loss in fiscal year was primarily due to the losses incurred on the large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract previously discussed  increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence and the abandonment of certain office space 
interest expense interest expense decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year due to slightly lower monthly borrowing activities compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to increased borrowings 
income taxes during fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year for fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of million and taxes expense for discontinued operations of  we recorded a million income tax benefit in fiscal year and related deferred tax asset 
we believe that it was appropriate to record the deferred tax asset based upon our estimates of future profitability 
the tax benefit consists of the realization of the tax benefits for timing differences for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
the components of the tax benefit are primarily the net operating loss carryforward  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence reserves and depreciation and amortization expense 
at march   the deferred tax asset was approximately million 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the secure networks services business  the results of operations of such business have been classified as discontinued operations for fiscal years   and income from discontinued operations was  million and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
gain on sale of discontinued operations we completed the sale of our secure network services business on june  as a requirement of the sale of our secure network services business  we deferred the recognition of the gain on the sale until certain contract contingencies related to the novation of a key contract were obtained 
on january   the final novations were received and the contingencies resolved 
as a result of the foregoing  we have recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations  net of taxes of million  of approximately million 
net income loss as a result of income from discontinued operations and the gain on the sale of discontinued operations partially offset by the loss from continuing operations  we reported net income of million for fiscal year or  earnings per share of 
basic and diluted 
as discussed above the principal reasons for the loss from continuing operations were the losses incurred on a long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  charge for impairment of goodwill and severance related costs 
for fiscal year  we recorded a net loss of million compared to net income for fiscal year of million 
the net loss per share  for fiscal year ended march  was 
basic and diluted compared to earnings per share of and basic and diluted for fiscal year ended march   respectively 
as discussed above  the primary reasons for the loss in fiscal year were the costs incurred on a long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence  and the abandonment of certain office space 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million  million  and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  depreciation and amortization decreased approximately  compared to fiscal year the decrease in was the result of lower depreciation expense  offset by higher amortization of intangibles as a result of the inclusion of alphanational for the entire fiscal year 
during fiscal year  depreciation and amortization expense increased  compared to fiscal year increase depreciation and amortization of intangible assets was a result of the microserv and alphanational acquisitions  and increased depreciation as a result of upgrading our information systems and technology 
we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on technology enhancements that will increase operating efficiencies 
sale of secure network services business on june   we simultaneously entered into and closed on an asset purchase agreement with indus corporation pursuant to which we sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our secure network services business 
the purchase price was approximately million  in addition to adjustments for working capital of approximately  for total consideration of approximately million 
the asset purchase agreement provided that million of the purchase price was to be held in escrow to serve as security to obtain certain consents  novations and indemnification obligations 
on july   the million held in escrow to serve as security to obtain certain consents was released to us 
certain other novations and consents required under the asset purchase agreement were received and  on january   million plus accrued interest of  was paid and released to us 
accordingly   of the original escrow amount remains in escrow as security for the payment of our indemnification obligations pursuant to the asset purchase agreement 
if there are no such obligations  these funds will be released to us eighteen months following the date of closing  or december  the asset purchase agreement contains representations  warranties  covenants and related indemnification provisions  in each case that are customary in connection with a transaction of this type  however  certain of the representations and warranties required updating to a date which is the earlier of the contract novation or thirty months from the closing 
in addition  survival periods applicable to such updated warranties may be extended together with related indemnification periods 
as of march  we are not aware of any claims associated with the remaining escrow 
the secure network services business comprised approximately million  or  million  or  and million  or  of our revenues for the fiscal years ended  and and represented of the company s assets at march  as a result of receiving notification that the key contract had been novated  we recorded a gain on the sale of the secure network services business after taxes  fees and costs of approximately million net of income taxes of approximately million 
as a result of the sale of the secure network services business  we utilized a portion of its net operating loss carryforward of approximately million in fiscal year ended march  and has reduced our deferred tax asset accordingly 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had approximately  of cash on hand 
sources of our cash in fiscal have been from cash generated from the sale of our secure network services business and our revolving credit facility 
we are continuing to focus on our core high availability maintenance services business while at the same time evaluating our future strategic direction 
as part of our business strategy  we intend on reducing our indebtedness 
with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the secure network services business  we repaid the following  principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures   principal amount of our promissory notes dated october   principal amount of our promissory notes dated october   accrued interest on our convertible subordinated debentures  and promissory notes dated october   october   november  and november    principal amount on our notes issued to former microserv shareholders  and  earn out to the former microserv shareholders 
the remainder of the proceeds were used for working capital purposes and to reduce our bank debt 
we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal will be cash generated from operations and cash available to us under our revolving credit agreement 
cash generated from operations may be affected by a number of factors 
see risk factors for a discussion of the factors that can negatively impact the amount of cash we generate from our operations 
although we have no definite plans to undertake any future debt or equity financing  we will continue to evaluate all potential funding alternatives 
among the possibilities for raising additional funds are issuances of debt or equity securities  and other borrowings under secured or unsecured credit facilities 
there can be no assurances that additional funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or the timing thereof 
our future financial performance will depend on our ability to continue to reduce and manage operating expenses  as well as our ability to grow revenues through obtaining new contracts and replacing contracts sold in connection with the sale of the secure networks services business 
our revenues will continue to be impacted by the loss of customers due to price competition and technological advances 
our future financial performance could be negatively affected by unforeseen factors and unplanned expenses 
see risk factors 
in furtherance of our business strategy  transactions we may enter into could increase or decrease our liquidity at any point in time 
if we were to obtain a significant contract or make contract modifications  we may be required to expend our cash or incur debt  which will decrease our liquidity 
conversely  if we dispose of assets  we may receive proceeds from such sales which could increase our liquidity 
from time to time  we are in discussions concerning acquisitions and dispositions which  if consummated  could impact our liquidity  perhaps significantly 
we expect to continue to require funds to meet remaining interest and principal payment obligations  capital expenditures and other non operating expenses 
see the discussion below including the contractual obligations table 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenue growth  expansion of our service offerings and business strategy 
we believe that our available funds  together with our existing revolving credit facility  will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations for at least through fiscal year the table below reflects our liquidity and capital resources

on june   we and our subsidiaries amended and restated our amended and restated loan and security agreement  referred to as the revolving credit agreement with provident bank to extend the maturity date to june  and revise the covenants as more fully described in the revolving credit agreement 
the amount available under the revolving credit agreement is million

the balance on the note at march   was  we have a consulting advisory service commitment with a former chief executive officer of the company 
from april  through march   we are to pay the former chief executive officer  per year for consulting services 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with a government contract  we act as a conduit in a financing transaction on behalf of a third party 
we routinely transfer receivables to a third party in connection with equipment sold to end users 
the credit risk passes to the third party at the point of sale of the receivables 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  transfers were accounted for as sales  and as a result  the related receivables have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount paid to us for the receivables by the transferee is equal to our carrying value and therefore no gain or loss is recognized on these transfers 
the end user remits its monthly payments directly to an escrow account held by a third party from which payments are made to the transferee and us  for various services provided to the end users 
we provide limited monthly servicing whereby we invoice the end user on behalf of the transferee 
the off balance sheet transactions had no impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
we are not aware of any event  demand or uncertainty that would likely terminate the agreement or have an adverse affect on our operations 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements as they affect the updated amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as policies that involve critical accounting estimates that require i management to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and ii different estimates that could have been reasonably used for the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or in results of operations 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  which impact cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impact write offs of goodwill and intangibles  depreciation of property and equipment  income taxes and valuation allowances 
we discuss these policies further below  as well as the estimates and management s judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as policies for revenue recognition  including unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenues  as well as policies governing the estimate of the useful life of our property and equipment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  to make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe that the estimates and judgments generally required by these policies are not as difficult or subjective and are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenues based on contracted fees earned  net of credits and adjustments  as the service is performed 
revenues from long term fixed unit price contracts are recognized monthly as service is performed based upon the number of units covered and the level of service requested 
the pricing in these contracts is fixed as to the unit price but varies based upon the number of units covered and service level requested 
revenues from time and material professional service contracts are recognized as services are delivered 
certain seat management contracts include the delivery and installation of new equipment combined with multi year service agreements 
revenues related to the delivery and installation of equipment under these and certain other contracts are recognized upon the completion of both the delivery and installation 
invoices billed in advance are recognized as revenues when earned 
revenues are a function of the mix of long term services contracts and time and material and professional service contracts 
revenues from time and material professional service contracts are difficult to forecast because of wide fluctuations in demand 
the long term contracts are more predictable and  as a result  the revenues stream is less difficult to forecast 
the gross margins on long term contracts vary inversely with the call volume received from customers in any one reporting period 
our expectation is that we will see continued growth in long term contracts  which historically have had higher gross margins  and continued downward pressure on hardware and software margins 
provisions for loss contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
inventory valuation reserves we write down inventory and record obsolescence reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon anticipated future usage  prior demand  equipment use  current and anticipated contracts and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecast for inventory usage  a significant unanticipated change in technology could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported value 
if actual demand is less than anticipated  or if our prior usage to support our contracts and anticipated future demand changes  we would be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
for the last three years  our inventory reserve ranged from to of inventory 
based upon our historical experience  the charge for fiscal year is budgeted to be approximately  or to of inventory 
a change in estimate would have an impact on earnings of approximately  due to economic uncertainties and the dramatic decreases in the cost for computing equipment  we increased our reserve for inventory obsolescence 
the amount charged to expense for reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately  in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it can significantly affect net income and treatment of the allowance requires us to anticipate the economic viability of our customers and requires a degree of judgment 
our estimate of bad debt expense is approximately 
of annual revenues 
a change in the estimate by would have an impact on earnings of approximately  over the past three years bad debts expense represented approximately 
to of revenues 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have adopted sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly we no longer amortize goodwill  but will continue to amortize other acquisition related costs 
during fiscal year  amortization of acquisition related intangibles was  up from  in fiscal year we assign useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and our intended use for those assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate these carrying values may not be recoverable 
any changes in these asset lives would be reported in our statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined 
our impairment review is based on the applicable valuation methods  including the income and market approaches 
halifax has been designated as a single reporting unit for financial reporting purposes 
under this method  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value inclusive of goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is necessary 
if our revenues and cost forecasts are not achieved  we fail to have continued profitability and market acceptance  or the market conditions in the stock market cause the valuation to decline  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
in december  an assessment of goodwill and intangible assets was conducted to test for impairment  and we concluded that there was an impairment of goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to operations of million for impairment of goodwill during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march  property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of property and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of our equipment is depreciated over three to ten years 
the estimated useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization in future periods 
we review for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  utilizing cash flows which take into account management s estimates of future operations 
income taxes and valuation allowance deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that  if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  historical financial results adjusted for non recurring items and all other available evidence 
management believes that based on the weight of the evidence  including estimates of future profitability  that a valuation allowance is not necessary 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
management will continue to monitor its historical results when adjusted for non recurring items  estimates of future profitability and all other evidence to assess the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
should management determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  this would have a significant negative effect on net income 
results of operations and forward looking statements our other results of operations and other forward looking statements contained herein involve a number of risks and uncertainties  in particular  plans to cultivate new business  the ability to expand our footprint  revenues  pricing  gross margins and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  and potential future impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the factors discussed above  other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to the following business and economic conditions in the areas we serve  possible disruption in commercial activities related to terrorist activities  reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  pricing pressures and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory values

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of bank debt to finance our business 
the floating interest rate exposes us to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate exposure resulting from changes in the prime rate 
it is assumed in the table below that the prime rate will remain constant in the future 
adverse changes in the interest rates or our inability to refinance our long term obligations may have a material negative impact on our operations 
the definitive extent of our interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we do not believe such risk is material 
we do not customarily use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
the information below summarizes our sensitivity to market risks as of march  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity of our funded debt 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains descriptions of our debt and should be read in conjunction with the table below 
long term debt including current maturities total debt fair value amounts in thousands revolving credit agreement at the prime rate plus  due june  average interest rate of 
subordinated notes from affiliate due july  notes issued to former alphanational shareholders due march  equipment under a capitalized lease  interest  month term total fixed rate debt total debt at present  all transactions are billed and denominated in us dollars and consequently  we do not currently have any material exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk 
at march   we had million of debt outstanding  of which million bore fixed interest rates 
if interest rates charged to us on our variable rate debt were to increase significantly  the effect could be materially adverse to our operations 
during fiscal year  we requested and received consent from provident bank to pay million to the affiliates paying the  face amount of our convertible subordinated debt   and  face amounts of our promissory notes in full 
with the amendment of the revolving credit agreement the due date on the notes was extended to july  after giving effect to these payments  we owe million in an aggregate principal amount to the holders of the promissory notes 
on april   after receiving consent from provident bank  we repaid  in notes and accrued interest to the former alphanational shareholders 
we conduct a limited amount of business overseas  principally in western europe  and in mexico and canada 
at the present  all transactions are billed and denominated in us dollars and consequently  we do not currently have any material exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk
