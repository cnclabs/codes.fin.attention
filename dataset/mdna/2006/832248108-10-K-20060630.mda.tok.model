some of these arrangements obligate the company to purchase all of the hogs produced by these producers 
other arrangements obligate the company to purchase a fixed amount of hogs 
due to the uncertainty of the number of hogs that the company will be obligated to purchase and the uncertainty of market prices at the time of hog purchases  the company has estimated its obligations under these arrangements 
the company based its estimates on its past history for hog quantities 
for fiscal year  the average purchase price estimated is based on available futures contract values and internal 
table of contents projections adjusted for historical quality premiums 
for prices beyond fiscal  the company estimated the market price of hogs based on the ten year average of per pound

these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that the company would have to make actual cash outlays in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that the company is unable to predict

derivative financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks primarily from changes in commodity prices  as well as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  the company enters into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to the company s policies and procedures 
the company believes the risk of default or nonperformance on contracts with counterparties is not significant 
the company s meat processing and hog production operations use various raw materials  mainly corn  lean hogs  live cattle  pork bellies  soybeans and wheat  which are actively traded on commodity exchanges 
the company hedges these commodities when management determines conditions are appropriate to mitigate the inherent price risks 
while this may limit the company s ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations  it also tends to reduce the risk of loss from adverse changes in raw material prices 
the company attempts to closely match the hedging instrument terms with the hedged item s terms 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates on certain financial instruments and periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain of its foreign currency exposure 
foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are recorded as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges  as appropriate  and were not material to the results of operations in fiscal or 
table of contents commodity cash flow hedges the company utilizes derivatives primarily futures contracts to manage its exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to commodity price risk associated with forecasted purchases and sales of corn  hogs  live cattle  frozen pork bellies  soybean meal  soybeans and wheat 
when all hedge accounting criteria have been met  these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges 
ineffectiveness related to the company s cash flow hedges was not material in fiscal or  and there were no derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
commodity and interest rate fair value hedges the company s commodity price risk management strategy also includes derivative transactions primarily futures contracts that are designated as fair value hedges 
these derivatives are designated as hedges of firm commitments to buy grains and livestock and hedges of live hog inventory 
ineffectiveness related to the company s fair value hedges was not material in fiscal or  and there were no derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness during these time periods 
the following table provides the fair value gain or loss of the company s open derivative financial instruments as of april  and may  in millions livestock grains interest rates foreign currency the variation in the company s fair value of open derivative financial instruments from period to period is primarily based on the company s analysis of current and future market conditions  which results in varying hedge portfolios to reduce the perceived risk to acceptable levels  and the exercise price on the open contracts as compared to the market price 
as of april   the company had commodity futures contracts that exceeded twelve months 
in addition  as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of april   the company had million of forward grain contracts which  if valued at april  market prices  would be million 
these forward grain contracts are accounted for as normal purchases as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
as a result they are not marked to market 
the following table presents the sensitivity of the fair value of the company s open commodity contracts and interest rate and foreign currency contracts to a hypothetical change in market prices or in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as of april  and may  in millions livestock grains interest rates foreign currency for the fiscal year ended april   the company reported gains on its closed derivative instruments of million 
for the fiscal year ended may   the company reported losses on its closed derivative instruments of million 
for the fiscal years ended april  and may   the company hedged approximately and of its grain purchases and and of its livestock produced  respectively 

table of contents in addition  the company has certain interest rate derivatives that swap fixed rate debt to floating rate debt  which are classified as fair value hedges outstanding at april  critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions are based on the company s experience combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
these estimates may differ from actual results 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to reflect the company s financial position and results of operations and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies considered critical by the management of the company 
hedge accounting the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices and accounts for the use of such instruments in accordance with sfas sfas requires both a historical and prospective assessment of the effectiveness of the instrument 
in certain circumstances  volatile activity in the commodity markets could cause this assessment to temporarily reflect the instrument as an ineffective hedge and require the company to discontinue hedge accounting on the instrument 
in addition  the company routinely hedges forecasted transactions 
in the unusual circumstance that these transactions fail to occur or are deemed probable of not occurring  hedge accounting would be discontinued on the instruments hedging those forecasted transactions 
in both situations  the discontinuance of hedge accounting would require changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument to be recognized in current period earnings 
management believes that the assumptions and methodologies used in the accounting for derivative financial instruments are the most appropriate and reasonable for the company s hedging program 
pension accounting the measurement of the pension obligation  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions regarding future events 
the key assumptions used by the company include discount rates  salary growth  retirement ages mortality rates and the expected return on plan assets 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year end on corporate bonds rated aa and above with a maturity to match the company s expected benefit payment stream 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  investment strategy and historical returns of the asset categories 
the effects of actual results differing from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense in such future periods 
due to higher market rates for high quality fixed income investments  the company increased the discount rate used to measure its pension obligations to as of april  from as of may  this increase lowered the present value of benefit obligations which decreased the minimum pension liability by million in fiscal to million 
this minimum pension liability will not require immediate funding and could potentially be reduced further or eliminated based on discount rate increases and improved plan asset returns 
the expected return on plan assets as of april  remained at 
the company s pension plan funding was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and is expected to be at least million in fiscal beyond fiscal  pension funding is expected to decrease moderately 
however  a significant devaluation of plan assets would cause a significant increase in funding while more favorable returns would reduce funding requirements 
future legislative actions could also impact future funding 
the company expects pension expense for fiscal to be approximately million
