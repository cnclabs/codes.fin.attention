item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information that appears elsewhere in this report 
overview we operate in the for hire truckload segment of the trucking industry 
customers in a variety of industries engage us to haul truckload quantities of freight  with the trailer we use to haul that freight being assigned exclusively to that customer s freight until delivery 
we generally charge customers for these services on a per mile basis 
we have three operating divisions through which we provide these services  and we aggregate the financial data for those divisions for purposes of our public reporting 
we refer to our three operating divisions as general freight  regional freight and usa logistics 
general freight 
our general freight division provides truckload freight services as a medium haul common carrier 
in the truckload industry  companies whose average length of haul is more than miles but less than  miles are often referred to as medium haul carriers 
our average length of haul has been within that range throughout our history 
we have provided general freight services since our inception  and we derive the largest portion of our revenues from these services 
regional freight 
regional freight refers to truckload freight services that involve a length of haul of approximately miles 
beginning in  in order to aid in driver recruitment and retention and to participate in the largest market segment within the truckload market  we began to accept shipments that originate and terminate within a smaller geographic area 
currently  we conduct regional freight operations in the areas around our facilities located in van buren  arkansas and butler township  ohio 
usa logistics 
our usa logistics division provides three services to our customers dedicated freight 
dedicated freight services are a variation of our general freight services  whereby we agree to make our equipment and drivers available to a specific customer for shipments over particular routes at specified times 
in addition to serving specific customer needs  our dedicated freight services aid in driver recruitment and retention 
third party logistics 
we provide a variety of freight handling services for our customers  including arranging for the transportation of freight 
freight brokerage 
we match a customer s shipments with available equipment of other carriers  when it is not feasible to use our own equipment 
we provide third party logistics and freight brokerage services as a complement to our truckload freight services 
we provide these services primarily to our existing freight customers  many of whom prefer to rely on a single carrier  or a small group of carriers  to provide all of their transportation needs 
to date  a significant majority of our third party logistics and freight brokerage customers have also engaged us to provide truckload freight services 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following o revenue recognition and related direct expenses based on relative transit time each period 
the total revenue that we record upon dispatch and related direct expenses are recognized in one or more reporting periods based on the estimated percentage of the delivery service  utilizing a bill by bill analysis  that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
o selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
we operate a significant number of tractors and trailers in connection with our business 
we may purchase this equipment or acquire it under capital leases 
we depreciate purchased equipment on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
we initially record equipment acquired under capital leases at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortize it on the straight line method over the lease term 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from three years to ten years 
we estimate the salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
we continually monitor used tractor and trailer values and adjust depreciable lives  depreciation expense and salvage values of our tractors and trailers as necessary to keep their values in line with expected market values at the time of disposal 
o estimates of accrued liabilities for claims involving bodily injury  physical damage losses  employee health benefits and workers compensation we record both current and long term claims accruals at the estimated ultimate payment amounts based on information such as individual case estimates or historical claims experience 
the current portion reflects the amounts of claims expected to be paid in the next twelve months 
in making the estimates we rely on past experience with similar claims  negative or positive developments in the case and similar factors 
we do not discount our claims liabilities 
o allowance for doubtful accounts 
we extend credit to our customers in the normal course of business 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses based upon our loss history  aging analysis and ongoing risk assessment of specific customers 
such losses have been within our expectations 
accounts receivable are comprised of a diversified customer base that results in a lack of concentration of credit risk 
o stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation to employees based on the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under apb no 
 if the exercise price of employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date  no compensation expense is recorded 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

this policy will change in january with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
we periodically reevaluate these policies as circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flow from period to period 
results of operations executive overview we produced solid results in as compared to  posting record base revenue  net income and earnings per share and making steady progress towards management s target of an or better operating ratio 
the industry saw strong freight demand during  characterized by steady north american economic growth and continued tightness in truckload capacity relative to shipping volumes 
this freight demand  coupled with the success of our benchmarking program  contributed to our improved operating margin 
during  we made notable progress in each of the three areas upon which our benchmarking program was primarily focused miles per tractor per week tractor utilization improved by  insurance and claims expense  as a percentage of base revenue  improved by percentage points  and operations and maintenance expense  as a percentage of base revenue  improved by percentage points 
in addition to the progress within the benchmarking program  we also reduced our fuel expense  as a percentage of base revenue  by percentage points through a more efficient fuel surcharge program despite higher average fuel cost per gallon 
overall  our operating ratio improved by percentage points of base revenue to  our best performance since the truckload industry s growth has been constricted in recent years because of a shortage of qualified drivers 
this has prevented many of our publicly held peers from growing their tractor fleets and has caused a few of them to reduce their fleet size 
by developing elaborate programs to manage driver compensation  hiring  training and retention  we have been able to generate a steady supply of drivers 
that success has been expensive  however  as growing driver compensation and recruiting costs continue to apply pressure to the salaries  wages and employee benefits and other operating expense lines on our income statement 
those costs increased by a combined percentage points of base revenue during however  our ability to consistently hire qualified drivers and the strong freight demand enabled us to grow base revenue by to million 
the growth resulted from a tractor fleet expansion  a increase in base revenue per mile derived from shipments on which we used our own tractors and the improvement in tractor utilization mentioned above 
our third party logistics and freight brokerage base revenue shipments for which we hired a third party trucking company to haul the freight decreased by to million for compared to the prior year  as we increasingly focused on our trucking operations 
during  we intend to direct more attention and resources toward our trucking operations and freight brokerage services  while placing less emphasis on the more complex logistics services 
the impact of all these factors on the bottom line was a increase in net income to million and a increase in diluted earnings per share to 
the balance sheet was strengthened by the record earnings and the stock offering in august of two million shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds to us of million  which we applied to reduce outstanding debt 
our total debt decreased to million and stockholders equity grew to million 
we also restructured our revolving senior credit facility to provide up to million of available borrowings through august we believe that the stock offering and expanded credit line will help fulfill our capital needs for the next several years 
note regarding presentation by agreement with our customers  and consistent with industry practice  we add a graduated surcharge to the rates we charge our customers as diesel fuel prices increase above an industry standard baseline price per gallon 
the surcharge is designed to approximately offset increases in fuel costs above the baseline 
fuel prices are volatile  and the fuel surcharge therefore increases our revenue at different rates for each period 
we believe that comparing operating costs and expenses to total revenue  including the fuel surcharge  could provide a distorted comparison of our operating performance  particularly when comparing results for current and prior periods 
therefore  we have used base revenue  which excludes the fuel surcharge revenue  and  instead  taken the fuel surcharge as a credit against the fuel and fuel taxes line item in the table below 
we believe that this presentation is a more meaningful measure of our operating performance than a presentation comparing operating costs and expenses to total revenue  including the fuel surcharge 
we do not believe that a reconciliation of the information presented on this basis and corresponding information comparing operating costs and expenses to total revenue would be meaningful 
data regarding both total revenue  which includes the fuel surcharge  and base revenue  which excludes fuel surcharge  is included in the consolidated statements of income included in this report 
base revenues from our third party logistics and brokerage services have fluctuated in recent periods 
these services do not typically involve the use of our tractors and trailers 
therefore  an increase in these revenues tends to cause expenses related to our operations that do involve our equipment including depreciation and amortization expense  operations and maintenance expense  salaries  wages and employee benefits and insurance and claims expense to decrease as a percentage of base revenue  and a decrease in these revenues tends to cause those expenses to increase as a percentage of base revenue 
since changes in third party logistics and freight brokerage revenues generally affect all such expenses  as a percentage of base revenue  we do not specifically mention it as a factor in our discussion of increases or decreases in those expenses in the period to period comparisons below 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to base revenue  for the years indicated 
the period to period comparisons below should be read in conjunction with this table and our consolidated statements of income and accompanying notes 
year ended december  revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses and costs salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amorization insurance and claims purchased transportation operating and maintenance operating taxes and licenses communications and utilities gain on disposal of assets other total operating expenses and costs operating income other expenses income interest expense other  net total other expenses  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net of fuel surcharge revenue fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december key operating statistics year ended december  total miles loaded and empty in thousands   empty mile factor base revenue per total mile average number of tractors   average miles per tractor per week   average unmanned tractor percentage the empty mile factor is the number of miles traveled between loads as a percentage of total miles traveled 
average unmanned tractor percentage is the average percentage  for each month end during the period  of company operated tractors to which a driver is not assigned 
base revenue our base revenue grew to million 
the increase resulted from several important factors we grew the average size of our fleet by  which was made possible by strong demand for truckload freight services and our ability to consistently hire qualified truck drivers despite a very tight labor market 
we attribute that ability to the management process that we have in place to attract and retain drivers 
we increased our tractor utilization measured in miles per tractor per week by 
again  the strong demand contributed to our success here  but we also have developed a sophisticated management process in this area as well  aided by our iso quality management system 
we were able to increase the rates per mile charged to our customers by for shipments in which we used our own tractors 
shipping rates have been increasing in recent years due to a persistent imbalance between the supply of truckload tractors in the marketplace relative to the demand for truckload services 
base revenue from our general freight division  regional freight division and the dedicated freight component of our usa logistics division grew by to million because of the reasons discussed above 
our third party logistics and freight brokerage base revenue declined by to million as we began transitioning our focus and resources away from more complex third party logistics services during the year and  instead  concentrating our efforts on our core competency of asset based trucking as well as freight brokerage services 
while third party logistics revenues decreased by  our freight brokerage services actually grew by to million 
the overall decrease in non asset based revenue was the primary reason for the decline in the purchased transportation operating expense line because the fees paid to third party carriers appear in that line item 
operating expenses and taxes overall  we improved our operating ratio by percentage points of base revenue to 
we attribute that improved margin to a combination of the strong freight demand mentioned above and to the success of our ongoing benchmarking program 
our benchmarking program identifies areas of potential improvement in operating cost and revenue factors by comparing the current period s performance to that of our designated benchmark year the benchmarking program lays out a roadmap of sorts that is assisting our progress towards our target of an operating ratio 
during  the benchmarking program was focused on three primary areas of margin improvement operations and maintenance costs  insurance and claims costs and tractor utilization 
progress in each of the three areas contributed to our improved operating ratio  as follows we completed a multi quarter program in to reduce the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets to their targeted levels of approximately months and months  respectively 
the effect of those reduced ages has been lower repair and general operating costs 
that factor and an enhanced process for managing maintenance costs were the primary factors in the percentage points of base revenue reduction of the operations and maintenance operating expense line 
we have completed our benchmarking work in this area and will work to maintain the level of expenses going forward 
the insurance and claims operating expense line decreased by percentage points of base revenue 
in  we began an intense effort to improve our motor vehicle accident prevention program and enhance our claims management process 
during  we made progress in both areas as our frequency of serious accidents per million miles traveled decreased by and the number of auto liability claims being actively managed by our risk management staff decreased 
despite our progress  our performance was still percentage points of base revenue away from our benchmark of of base revenue 
tractor utilization  as mentioned above  improved by and is still below our benchmark of  miles per tractor 
fuel and fuel taxes expense also improved by percentage points of base revenue despite a increase in the average cost of diesel fuel and a slight decrease in fuel economy resulting from tighter emission standards on our tractors 
the improvement in fuel and fuel tax expense was made possible primarily by the improved efficiency of our fuel surcharge program and  to a lesser extent  by our efforts to mitigate the fuel economy decrease through various management programs 
the depreciation operating expense line was also affected by the increased cost of those emission compliant tractors 
expenses increased in the areas of driver compensation  recruitment and training 
the increases  described below  are primarily the result of the aforementioned limited supply of qualified drivers the salaries  wages and employee benefits operating expense line increased by percentage points of base revenue primarily because we increased driver compensation per mile by in we have been steadily increasing driver pay for the past few years to stay competitive in the marketplace 
the costs of recruiting and training drivers have also increased in recent years as competition for qualified drivers has intensified 
the effects of those increases in are the primary cause of the percentage points of base revenue increase in the other operating expense line 
our effective tax rate decreased from in to in income tax expense varies from the amount computed by applying the federal tax rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to state income taxes  net of federal income tax effect  adjusted for permanent differences  the most significant of which is the effect of the per diem pay structure for drivers 
due to the partially nondeductible effect of per diem  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods based on fluctuations in earnings and in the number of drivers who elect to receive this pay structure 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december key operating statistics year ended december  total miles loaded and empty in thousands   empty mile factor base revenue per total mile average number of tractors   average miles per tractor per week   average unmanned tractor percentage the empty mile factor is the number of miles traveled between loads as a percentage of total miles traveled 
average unmanned tractor percentage is the average percentage  for each month end during the period  of company operated tractors to which a driver is not assigned 
base revenue our base revenue grew to million 
the increase resulted from several important factors this increase was due primarily to an increase of in the average number of tractors operated from  including owner operators in to  including owner operators in  an increase of in base revenue per total mile and  to a lesser extent  an improvement in our empty mile factor and an increase in the number of workdays from in to in average base revenue per total mile increased from in to in due to an increase in the average rate per mile charged to customers and  to a lesser extent  an increase in third party logistics and brokerage revenues and the improvement in our empty mile factor 
the empty mile factor decreased from of total miles in to of total miles in the decreased empty mile factor was primarily the result of improved freight demand in our operating areas and  to a lesser extent  reduced quantities of inbound loads into areas where there were few available outbound loads 
operating expenses and taxes our base revenue grew to million 
the increase resulted from several important factors the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits expense  as a percentage of base revenue  was primarily the result of an increase in average base revenue per mile 
these effects were partially offset by an increase in monetary incentive compensation accrued for employees due to improved financial performance from to and an increase in the cost of employee medical benefits expense 
we increased driver pay effective in mid december the pay increase impacted approximately of our drivers and was comprised of a one cent per mile increase for all eligible drivers plus an additional one cent per mile for eligible drivers with zero to nine months of experience 
affected drivers received an average pay increase of approximately per mile 
the increase was intended to address driver recruiting and retention objectives by maintaining our pay scale s competitive position relative to our peers with whom we directly compete for drivers 
because of the timing of this increase  it had a minimal effect on operating results 
the decrease in operations and maintenance expense  as a percentage of base revenue  was primarily due to decreased direct repair costs resulting from a decrease in the average age of our revenue equipment 
the increase in insurance and claims expense  as a percent of base revenue  was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with bodily injury and property damage claims as a result of our continued efforts to settle and litigate certain older claims and  to a lesser extent  an increase in expenses associated with accident damage to our own revenue equipment 
our effective tax rate decreased from in to in the effective rates varied from the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes and certain non deductible expenses including our per diem pay structure 
due to increased pre tax income in  the impact of the non deductible expenses had a lesser impact on the effective rate than in seasonality in the trucking industry  revenues generally decrease as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses increase  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs 
future revenues could be impacted if our customers  particularly those with manufacturing operations  reduce shipments due to temporary plant closings 
historically  many of our customers have closed their plants for maintenance or other reasons during january and july 
inflation although most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  the effect of inflation on revenue and operating costs has been minimal in recent years 
the effect of inflation driven cost increases on our overall operating costs would not be expected to be greater for us than for our competitors 
fuel availability and cost the motor carrier industry is dependent upon the availability of fuel 
fuel shortages or increases in fuel taxes or fuel costs have adversely affected our profitability and will continue to do so 
fuel prices have fluctuated widely and fuel taxes have generally increased in recent years 
we have not experienced difficulty in maintaining necessary fuel supplies  and in the past we generally have been able to partially offset increases in fuel costs and fuel taxes through increased freight rates and through a fuel surcharge that increases incrementally as the price of fuel increases above a certain baseline price 
typically  we are not able to fully recover increases in fuel prices through rate increases and fuel surcharges  primarily because those items do not provide any benefit with respect to empty and out of route miles  for which we do not receive compensation from customers 
we do not have any long term fuel purchase contracts and we have not entered into any hedging arrangements that protect us against fuel price increases 
overall  the market fuel prices per gallon were higher in and than in off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
from time to time we enter into operating leases that are not reflected in our balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources the continued growth of our business has required significant investments in new revenue equipment 
we have financed new tractor and trailer purchases predominantly with cash flows from operations  the proceeds from sales or trades of used equipment  borrowings under our senior credit facility and capital lease purchase arrangements 
we have historically met our working capital needs with cash flows from operations and with borrowings under our facility 
we use the facility to minimize fluctuations in cash flow needs and to provide flexibility in financing revenue equipment purchases 
management is not aware of any known trends or uncertainties that would cause a significant change in our sources of liquidity 
we expect our principal sources of capital to be sufficient to finance our operations  annual debt maturities  lease commitments  letter of credit commitments  stock repurchases and capital expenditures for the next several years 
there can be no assurance  however  that such sources will be sufficient to fund our operations and all expansion plans for the next several years  or that any necessary additional financing will be available  if at all  in amounts required or on terms satisfactory to us 
cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in provided by financing activities   cash generated from operations increased million during as compared to the change was primarily due to a million increase in revenue along with an improvement in our operating margin  which resulted in an million increase in net income 
cash generated from operations increased million during as compared to the increase was primarily caused by a million increase in revenue and an improvement in our profit margin 
cash used in investing activities decreased million during as compared to due to a reduction in our expenditures for revenue equipment 
in  we accelerated our trailer acquisitions to take advantage of favorable pricing on new trailers 
this resulted in an addition of  trailers to our fleet in while we decreased our trailer fleet by in this reduction was planned in order to bring our trailer to tractor ratio down to budgeted levels 
in  our cash used in investing activities increased million from as a result of our equipment modernization campaign 
in  we purchased tractors and  trailers compared to tractors and trailers in these purchases were offset by the sale or trade in of tractors and trailers in compared to tractors and trailers in cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in this million difference is due primarily to increased payments on capital leases and decreased net borrowings on our senior credit facility 
our stock offering  completed in august  generated million of proceeds which were used to pay down our senior credit facility 
cash provided by financing activities increased million during compared to the increase was primarily due to increased net borrowing on our senior credit facility of million 
debt on september   we entered into an amended and restated senior credit facility  which restates in its entirety and makes certain amendments to our previously amended facility dated as of april  the facility was amended to  among other things  increase the maximum borrowing amount to million  subject to a borrowing base calculation 
the facility includes a sublimit of up to million for letters of credit and matures september  the facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and otherwise unencumbered revenue equipment 
the facility provides an accordion feature allowing us to increase the maximum borrowing amount by up to an additional million in the aggregate in one or more increases no less than six months prior to the maturity date  subject to certain conditions 
the maximum borrowing including the accordion feature may not exceed million without the consent of the lenders 
at december   million was outstanding under the senior credit facility 
the facility bears variable interest based on the agent bank s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus a certain percentage or the london interbank offered rate commonly referred to as libor plus a certain percentage  which is determined based on our attainment of certain financial ratios 
for the year ending december   the effective interest rate was 
a quarterly commitment fee is payable on the unused credit line at a rate which is determined based on our attainment of certain financial ratios 
at december   the rate was per annum 
the facility contains various covenants  which require us to meet certain quarterly financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
our principal sources of available liquidity are cash provided by operating activities  the million we had available under our facility at december   proceeds from sales of revenue equipment and capital leases 
we generated cash flows from operating activities of million and million in and  respectively 
in  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
we currently have million of availability for new capital leases under existing lease facilities 
we are not aware of any known trends or uncertainties that would cause a significant change in our sources of liquidity 
equity at december   we had stockholders equity of million and long term debt  net of current maturities  of million  resulting in a debt to long term capitalization ratio of compared to at december  on august   we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering million shares of common stock in exchange for proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we used the net proceeds of our sale of stock in the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 
in addition to the shares sold by us in this public offering  certain officers and directors sold million shares of common stock 
purchases and commitments as of december   our forecasted capital expenditures  net of proceeds from the sale of revenue equipment  for was million  million of which relates to revenue equipment 
we expect to use the balance of million primarily for property acquisitions  facility construction and improvements and maintenance and office equipment 
we routinely evaluate our equipment acquisition needs and adjust our purchase and disposition schedules from time to time based on our analysis of factors such as freight demand  the availability of drivers and the condition of the used equipment market 
our forecast reflects our decision to reschedule to the purchase of some tractors and trailers we had originally scheduled for purchase in we may cancel any or all of our equipment purchase commitments by giving notice to the applicable vendor at least days before the scheduled delivery date 
during the year ended december   we made million of net capital expenditures  including million for revenue equipment purchases million of which were capital lease obligations  million for facility expansions and million for non revenue equipment

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our senior credit facility 
our senior credit facility  as amended  provides for borrowings that bear interest at variable rates based on either a prime rate or the libor 
at december   we had million outstanding pursuant to our senior credit facility 
assuming the outstanding balance at year end remained constant throughout the upcoming year  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates applicable to the senior credit facility would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
we record derivative financial instruments  if any  in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at fair value  with classification as current or long term depending on the duration of the instrument 
on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
we designated the million interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flow resulting from the interest payments indexed to the month libor 
this interest rate swap agreement terminated on march  foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we require all customers to pay for our services in us dollars 
although the canadian government makes certain payments  such as tax refunds  to us in canadian dollars  any foreign currency exchange risk associated with such payments is not material 
commodity price risk 
fuel prices have fluctuated greatly and have generally increased in recent years 
in some periods  our operating performance was adversely affected because we were not able to fully offset the impact of higher diesel fuel prices through increased freight rates and fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
we do not have any long term fuel purchase contracts  and we have not entered into any other hedging arrangements  that protect us against fuel price increases 
volatile fuel prices will continue to impact us significantly 
a significant increase in fuel costs  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
these costs could also exacerbate the driver shortages our industry experiences by forcing independent contractors to cease operations
