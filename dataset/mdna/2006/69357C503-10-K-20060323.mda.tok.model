the recovery audit industry businesses with substantial volumes of payment transactions involving multiple vendors  numerous discounts and allowances  fluctuating prices and complex pricing arrangements find it difficult to process every payment correctly 
although these businesses process the vast majority of payment transactions correctly  a small number of errors occur principally because of communication failures between the purchasing and accounts payable departments  complex pricing arrangements  personnel turnover and changes in information and accounting systems 
these errors include  but are not limited to  missed or inaccurate discounts  allowances and rebates  vendor pricing errors and duplicate payments 
in the aggregate  these transaction errors can represent meaningful lost profits that can be particularly significant for businesses with relatively small profit margins 
although some businesses and most large retailers maintain internal recovery audit departments to recover selected types of payment errors and identify opportunities to reduce costs  independent recovery audit firms are often retained as well due to their specialized knowledge and focused technologies 
in the us  canada  the united kingdom and mexico  large retailers routinely engage independent recovery audit firms as standard business practice 
outside the us  canada  the united kingdom and mexico  the company believes that large retailers and many other types of businesses are also engaging independent recovery audit firms 
the domestic and international recovery audit industry for accounts payable services is comprised of the company and numerous smaller competitors 
most smaller recovery audit firms do not possess multi country service capabilities and lack the centralized resources or broad client base to support the technology investments required to provide comprehensive recovery audit services for large  complex accounts payable systems 
these firms are less equipped to audit large  data intensive purchasing and accounts payable systems 
in addition  many of these firms have limited resources  and may lack experience and the knowledge of national promotions  seasonal allowances and current recovery audit practices 
as a result  the company believes that it has competitive advantages based on its national and international presence  well trained and experienced professionals  and advanced technology 
as businesses have evolved  the company and the recovery auditing industry have evolved with them  innovating processes  error identification tools  and claim types to maximize recoveries 
the following are a number of the changes that have been driving the recovery audit industry in the recent past data capture and availability 
businesses are increasingly using technology to manage complex procurement and accounts payable systems and realize greater operating efficiencies 
many businesses worldwide communicate with vendors electronically whether by electronic data interchange edi or the internet to exchange inventory and sales data  transmit purchase orders  submit invoices  forward shipping and receiving information and remit payments 
these systems capture more detailed data and enable the cost effective review of more transactions by recovery auditors 
increasing number of auditable claim categories 
traditionally  the recovery audit industry identified simple  or disbursement  claim types such as the duplicate payment of invoices 
enhancements to accounts payable software  particularly large enterprise software solutions  used by many large companies have reduced the extent to which these companies make simple disbursement errors 
however  the introduction of creative vendor discount programs  complex pricing arrangements and activity based incentives has led to an increase in auditable transactions and potential sources of error 
these transactions are complicated to audit as the underlying transaction data is difficult to access and recognizing mistakes is complex 
recovery audit firms with significant industry specific expertise and sophisticated technology are best equipped to audit these complicated  or contract compliance  claim categories 
globalization 
as the operations of major retailers become increasingly global  they often seek service providers with a global reach 

table of contents consolidation in the retail industry 
retailer consolidation in the us and internationally continues 
as retailers grow larger  vendors become more reliant on a smaller number of customers and  as a result  the balance of power favors retailers rather than vendors 
this dynamic creates an environment that allows retailers to assert valid claims more easily 
significant promotional activity 
trade promotion spending is substantial within the retail trade and significant sums are being spent in categories with numerous transactions and a high potential for errors  such as scan downs  or discounts at the point of sale 
because of the high volume of trade promotion within retail  there are significant opportunities for mistakes and  therefore  auditable claims 
move toward standard auditing practices 
increasingly  vendors are insisting on the satisfaction of certain conditions  such as clearer post audit procedures  better documentation and electronic communication of claims  before accepting the validity of a claim 
the company  as the industry leader  has taken a leadership role in establishing standard recovery auditing practices for the industry and led the way to establishing the first ever retail summit and post audit best practices forum in the purpose of the summit was to begin providing a foundation for industry standards and norms with a goal of diminished ambiguity  greater efficiencies  lower costs and higher value for all stakeholders 
in december the second retail summit and best practices forum was held where academic professionals reported the preliminary results of ground breaking best practices research specific to the post audit industry with the goal of furthering the establishment of standard practices 
on january   the company in conjunction with the institute of customer relationship management icrm announced the release of the best practices in post audit recovery report 
this study  administered by noted academics and researchers over an month period  was based on extensive collaboration  exploratory discussions and descriptive research obtained from functional managers at leading us retail and manufacturing companies representing nearly trillion in combined revenues 
the evolution of the recovery auditing industry is expected to continue 
in particular  the company expects that the industry will continue to move towards the electronic capture and presentation of data  more automated  centralized processing and faster approvals and deductions 
the prg schultz solution the company provides its domestic and international clients with comprehensive recovery audit services by using sophisticated proprietary technology and advanced auditing techniques and methodologies  and by employing highly trained  experienced industry specialists 
as a result  the company believes it is able to identify significantly more payment errors than its clients are able to identify through their internal audit capabilities or than many of its competitors are able to identify 
the company is a leader in developing and utilizing sophisticated software audit tools and techniques that enhance the identification and recovery of payment errors 
by leveraging its technology investment across a large client base  the company is able to continue developing proprietary software tools and expanding its technology leadership in the recovery audit industry 
the company is also a leader in establishing new recovery audit practices to reflect evolving industry trends 
the company s auditors are highly trained 
many have joined the company from finance related management positions in the industries the company serves 
to support its clients  the company provides its auditors and audit teams with data processing services  software and software support  sales and marketing assistance  and training and administrative services 
the prg schultz strategy the company s objective is to build on its position as the leading worldwide provider of recovery audit services 
the company s strategic plan to achieve these objectives focuses on a series of initiatives designed to maintain its dedicated focus on its clients 
the company has implemented a number of strategic business initiatives to significantly reduce costs stabilize revenue at existing clients and offer new services to new and existing clients 
some of these key initiatives include 
table of contents centralize claim processing and field audit work 
the processing of certain claim types and certain client audits has been shifted to the company s salt lake city and atlanta shared service centers and its new jersey and texas regional audit centers  resulting in cost savings and improved audit productivity 
flatten management structure and focus on existing clients 
the company has reduced its number of management layers and has focused a greater portion of its resources on its existing client base 
improve audit software and processes 
the company has developed proprietary software tools and algorithms that enable its auditors to identify trends  exceptions and claims quickly and efficiently and use the best auditing practices to increase recoveries 
expand opportunities with existing clients 
the company intends to maximize the revenue opportunities with each of its existing clients by identifying and auditing new categories of potential errors such as its new freight rate audit program and third party pharmacy payment service offerings 
the company also intends to increase its emphasis on using its technology and professional experience to assist its clients in achieving objectives that are related to transaction accuracy and compliance  but do not directly involve recovery of past overpayments 
focus on international opportunities 
the company believes that its best opportunities for international growth are related to major global clients and that it is the only recovery audit firm with the capability to serve these clients in multiple geographies 
some of the company s international operations have proved to be unprofitable 
to improve profitability of its international business  the company plans to exit some international markets in and redirect the company s resources to the profitable international markets and clients 
develop medicare audit 
in  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  the federal agency that administers the medicare program  awarded the company a contract to provide recovery audit services for the state of california s medicare spending 
the three year contract  effective march   was awarded as part of a demonstration program by cms to recover overpayments on behalf of taxpayers through the use of recovery auditing 
the company expects to begin earning revenue from the california medicare audit in and believes that medicare audit has significant revenue and profit potential in future years 
prg schultz services accounts payable services through the use of proprietary technology  audit techniques and methodologies  the company s trained and experienced auditors examine procurement records on a post payment basis to identify overpayments  including those resulting from situations such as missed or inaccurate discounts  allowances and rebates  vendor pricing errors  duplicate payments and erroneous application of sales tax laws and regulations 
the company s accounts payable services target two main client types  retail wholesale and commercial  with each type typically served under a different service delivery model  as more particularly described below 
commercial clients are business entities other than retailers and wholesalers  such as manufacturers  distributors and service firms 
contract compliance audit services provided to retail wholesale clients currently account for the substantial majority of the company s revenues 
these audit services typically recur annually  but after the company s relationship with a given client matures  the dollar volume of client overpayments recovered begins to decline from year to year 
contract compliance audit services for retailers are the most comprehensive of the company s accounts payable services  focusing on numerous recovery categories related to both procurement and payment activities 
these audits typically entail comprehensive and customized data acquisition from the client with the aim of capturing individual line item transaction detail 
contract compliance audits for larger clients often require year round on site work by multi auditor teams 
many large retailers have internal recovery audit departments that audit payment data for errors before the data is released for audit by external recovery audit firms 
process and software improvements made by these internal recovery audit departments over time have increased their recoveries  thus 
table of contents reducing the number of compliance errors to be discovered by the external recovery audit firms 
this trend is expected to continue  and the company s revenues from its core retail wholesale accounts payable business are expected to continue to decline 
the substantial majority of the company s domestic commercial accounts payable services clients are currently served using a disbursement audit service model which typically entails obtaining limited data from the client and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories 
services to these types of clients to date have tended to be either periodic typically  every two to three years or rotational in nature with different divisions of a given client often audited in pre arranged annual sequences 
accordingly  revenues derived from a given client may change markedly from year to year 
additionally  the duration of a disbursement audit is often measured in weeks or months  as opposed to years  and the number of auditors assigned per client is usually between one and five 
because accounts payable software increasingly used by many large companies significantly reduces the number of disbursement errors  the company s revenues from commercial audits have rapidly declined in recent years and are expected to continue to do so

meridian has also developed new fee for service offerings providing accounts payable and employee expense reimbursement processing for third parties 
client contracts the company s typical client contract provides that the company is entitled to a stipulated percentage of overpayments or other savings recovered for or realized by clients 
clients generally recover claims by either a taking credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the involved vendors  or b receiving refund checks directly from those vendors 
the manner in which a claim is recovered by a client is often dictated by industry practice 
for some services  the client contract provides that the company is entitled to a flat fee  or fee rate per hour  or per unit of usage for the rendering of that service 
in addition to client contracts  many clients establish specific procedural guidelines that the company must satisfy prior to submitting claims for client approval 
these guidelines are unique to each client 
technology technology advancements  increasing volumes of business transactions and dynamic buying environments have resulted in the company s clients using complex financial systems to realize greater operating efficiencies and ensure transaction accuracy 
given this environment  the company believes its proprietary technology and processes serve as important competitive advantages over both its principal competitors and its clients in house internal recovery audit functions 
to sustain these competitive advantages  the company intends to continue investing in technology initiatives to deliver innovative  client focused solutions  which enable the company to provide its services in a timely  effective and profitable manner 
the company employs a variety of proprietary audit tools  proprietary databases and company owned and co locational data processing facilities in its business 
each of the company s businesses employs custom technology 
accounts payable services audit technology the company s data acquisition  data processing and data management methodologies are aimed at maximizing efficiencies and productivity and maintaining the highest standards of transaction assurance 

table of contents at the beginning of a typical recovery audit engagement  the company utilizes a dedicated staff of data acquisition specialists and proprietary tools to acquire a wide array of transaction data from its client for the time period under review 
the company typically receives this data by secured electronic transmissions  magnetic media or paper 
the company uses a custom  proprietary imaging technology to scan the paper into electronic format 
upon receipt  the data is secured  catalogued  backed up and converted into standard  readable formats using third party and proprietary tools 
massive volumes of client data are cleansed and mapped by the company s technology professionals  primarily using high performance database and storage technologies  into standardized layouts at one of the company s data processing facilities 
statistical reports are also generated to verify the completeness and accuracy of the data 
the data is then processed using algorithms business rules leveraging over thirty years experience to help uncover patterns or potential problems in clients various transactional streams 
the company delivers these high probability transaction errors to its auditors who  using the company s proprietary audit software  sort  filter and search the data to validate and identify additional transaction errors 
the company also maintains a secure database of audit information with the ability to query on multiple variables  including claim categories  industry codes  vendors and audit years  to facilitate the identification of additional recovery opportunities and provide recommendations for process improvements to clients 
once errors are validated with the client s internal documents and systems  the company offers an internet based claim presentation and collaboration tool  which leverages its proprietary imaging technology to help the client view  approve and submit claims to vendors 
the company has implemented and manages several distinct technical and procedural controls to ensure the confidentiality of client data and intellectual property

the reporting system produces reports that measure the financial and managerial information for each stage of the business process 
auditor hiring and training many of the company s auditors and specialists formerly held finance related management positions in the industries the company serves 
training provided in the field by the company s experienced auditors enables newly hired auditors to develop and refine their auditing skills and improve productivity 
additionally  the company provides training for auditors utilizing both classroom training and training via self paced media such as specialized computer based training modules 
training programs are periodically upgraded based on feedback from auditors and changing industry protocols 
clients the company provides its services principally to large and mid sized businesses having numerous payment transactions with many vendors 
retailers wholesalers continue to constitute the largest part of the company s client and revenue base 
the company s five largest clients contributed approximately  and of its revenues from continuing operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company did not have any clients who individually provided revenues in excess of of total revenues from continuing operations during the years ended december   and 
table of contents sales and marketing due to the highly confidential and proprietary nature of a business purchasing patterns and procurement practices combined with the typical desire to maximize the amount of funds recovered  most prospective clients conduct an extensive investigation prior to selecting a specific recovery audit firm 
the company has found that its service offerings that are the most annuity like in nature such as a contract compliance audit typically require a relatively long sales cycle and a relatively high level of direct person to person contact 
proprietary rights from time to time the company develops new recovery audit software and methodologies that enhance existing proprietary software and methodologies 
the company relies on trade secret and copyright protections for its proprietary software and other proprietary information 
while the company s competitive position may be affected by its ability to protect its software and other proprietary information  the company believes that the protection afforded by trade secret and copyright laws is generally less significant to the company s overall success than the continued pursuit and implementation of its operating strategies and other factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of its personnel 
the company owns or has rights to various copyrights  trademarks and trade names used in the company s business  including but not limited to prgschultz  auditpro  suref nd  direct f nd  imdex and claimdex 
competition the company has numerous existing contract compliance audit competitors that are believed to be substantially smaller than the company 
barriers to effective entry and longevity as a viable contract compliance audit firm are believed to be high 
the company believes that these high barriers to entry result from numerous factors including  but not limited to  significant technology infrastructure requirements  the need to gather  summarize and examine volumes of client data at the line item level of detail  the need to establish effective audit techniques and methodologies  and the need to hire and train audit professionals to work in a very specialized manner that requires technical proficiency with numerous recovery categories 
the disbursement audit services business is also highly competitive  but barriers to entry are relatively low 
the company believes that the low barriers to entry result from limited technology infrastructure requirements  the need for relatively minimal high level data  and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories 
while the company believes that it has the greatest depth and breadth of audit expertise  data and technology capabilities  scale and global presence in the industry  the company faces competition from the following client internal recovery audit departments 
a number of larger retailers particularly those in the grocery and drug sectors have developed an internal recovery audit process to review transactions prior to turning them over to external post audit providers 
regardless of the level of recoveries made by internal recovery audit departments  the company has observed that virtually all large retail clients retain at least one primary  and sometimes two primary and secondary  external recovery audit firms to capture errors missed by their internal recovery audit departments 
other recovery audit firms 
the competitive landscape in the recovery audit industry is comprised of full service accounts payable recovery audit firms 
the company believes that only one other company also offers a full suite of recovery audit services outside the united states  a large number of smaller accounts payable recovery firms which have a limited client base and which use less sophisticated tools to mine disbursement claim categories at low contingency rates 
these firms are most common in the us market and the largest of these firms typically have approximately million in annual revenue 
competition in most international markets  if any  typically comes from small niche providers  
table of contents firms which offer a hybrid of audit software tools and training  and or general accounts payable process improvement enablers  and firms with specialized skills focused on recovery audit services for discrete sectors like airlines and healthcare 
other providers of recovery services 
the big four accounting firms provide recovery audit services  however  the company believes their practices tend to be focused on tax related services

table of contents item a 
risk factors in four of the five annual periods ended december   we have incurred significant losses and we have not generated enough cash from operations to finance our business 
we have not been profitable in four of the five years in the five year period ended december   and we have not generated enough cash from operations to finance our business 
there is no guarantee that our cost reduction plan or attempts to increase our revenues will be successful 
if we are not able to successfully reduce costs and or increase revenues  we may not be able to operate profitability in the future or generate sufficient cash to fund our operations and pay our indebtedness 
our current projections reflect that our core accounts payable recovery audit business will continue to decline 
therefore  we must successfully implement our cost reduction plan and grow our other business lines in order to stabilize and increase our revenues and improve our profitability 
as our clients improve their systems and processes  fewer transactional errors occur 
in addition  many of our clients have internal staffs that audit the same transactions before we do 
as the skills  experience and resources of our clients internal recovery audit staffs improve  they will identify more overpayments themselves and reduce our audit recovery opportunities 
based on these and other factors  we currently believe that our core accounts payable recovery audit business will continue to experience revenue declines over the long term 
in order to stabilize and increase our revenues and improve our profitability  we must successfully implement our cost reduction plan  and grow our other lines of business such as our medicare audit work  pharmacy payment service and motor carrier freight bill audits 
these other lines of business are still in the early stages of development  and there can be no guarantee that they will ultimately succeed 
we depend on our largest clients for significant revenues  so losing a major client could adversely affect our revenues 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from our largest clients 
for the years ended december    and  our two largest clients accounted for approximately  and of our revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
if we lose any of our major clients  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of revenue unless we acquire new business to replace such clients 
client and vendor bankruptcies and financial difficulties could reduce our earnings 
our clients generally operate in intensely competitive environments and  accordingly  bankruptcy filings by our clients are not uncommon 
bankruptcy filings by our large clients or the significant vendors who supply them  or unexpectedly large vendor claim chargebacks lodged against one or more of our larger clients  could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  our inability to collect our accounts receivable due to the financial difficulties of one or more of our large clients could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if a client files for bankruptcy  we could be subject to an action to recover certain payments received in the days prior to the bankruptcy filing as preference payments 
if we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims  we would be required to make unbudgeted cash payments which could strain our financial liquidity and our earnings would be reduced 
for example  on march   the fleming post confirmation trust  pct  sued us in the bankruptcy proceeding of the fleming companies  a former client  in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware to recover approximately million of alleged preferential payments 
pct subsequently amended its claims to add a claim for alleged fraudulent transfers representing approximately million in commissions paid to us with respect to claims deducted from vendors that the client subsequently re credited to the vendors 
in early december  the pct offered to settle the case for million 
we countered with an offer to waive our bankruptcy claim and pay the pct  the pct rejected our counteroffer and the litigation is ongoing 

table of contents our strategic business initiatives may not be successful 
our objective is to build on our position as the leading worldwide provider of recovery audit services 
our strategic plan to achieve these objectives focuses on a series of initiatives designed to maintain our dedicated focus on clients and rekindle our growth 
recently  we have implemented a number of strategic business initiatives that are designed to reduce costs and stabilize revenues 
although we have begun to implement these initiatives  we are still in the early stages of the process 
each of the initiatives requires sustained management focus  organization and coordination over time  as well as success in building relationships with third parties 
the results of the strategy and implementation will not be known until some time in the future 
if we are unable to implement the strategy successfully  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of the strategy may require material increases in costs and expenses 
as part of a pilot program to use recovery auditing to recover overpayments on behalf of taxpayers  the centers for medicare medicaid services  cms  the federal agency that administers the medicare program  awarded us a three year contract  effective march   to provide recovery audit services in connection with the state of california s medicare spending 
we believe this contract is a significant opportunity for us  but we will have to expend substantial resources to prepare for and perform the cms audit services and there is no guarantee that actual revenues will justify the required expenditures 
moreover  until the cms pilot program is well underway  there will be no way to accurately predict the level of recoveries that will be achieved  and there is no guarantee that the level of recoveries will be significant 
even if cms deems the pilot program sufficiently successful to justify further ventures  there is no guarantee that it  or any other medical claims client  will award future contracts to us 
we may be unable to protect and maintain the competitive advantage of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
our operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to protect our proprietary software  audit techniques and methodologies  and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
although we presently hold us and foreign registered trademarks and us registered copyrights on certain of our proprietary technology  we may be unable to obtain similar protection on our other intellectual property 
in addition  our foreign registered trademarks may not receive the same enforcement protection as our us registered trademarks 
additionally  we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees  consultants  clients and potential clients 
we also limit access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may be unable to deter misappropriation or unauthorized dissemination of our proprietary information  detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
even though we take care to protect our own intellectual property  there is no guarantee that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we are also subject to the risk that someone else will assert a claim against us in the future for violating their intellectual property rights 
our failure to retain the services of key members of management and highly skilled personnel could adversely impact our continued success 
our continued success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our executive officers and key employees 
as such  we have entered into employment agreements with key members of management 
while these employment agreements limit the ability of key employees to directly compete with us in the future  nothing prevents them from leaving our company 
in addition  our current financial and operational condition  including  but not limited to our liquidity concerns  makes it especially challenging to attract and retain highly qualified skilled auditors in an industry where competition for skilled personnel is intense 
accordingly  our future performance also depends  in part  on the ability of our management team to work together effectively  manage our workforce  and retain highly qualified personnel 

table of contents we rely on international operations for significant revenues 
approximately of our revenues from continuing operations were generated from international operations in international operations are subject to numerous risks  including political and economic instability in the international markets we serve  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  particularly weaknesses in the british pound  the euro  the canadian dollar  the mexican peso  and the brazilian real and other currencies of countries in which we transact business  which could result in currency translations that materially reduce our revenues and earnings  costs associated with adapting our services to our foreign clients needs  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws  expenses and legal restrictions associated with transferring earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to us  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices  business interruptions due to widespread disease  potential terrorist activities  or other catastrophes  reduced or limited protection of our intellectual property rights  and longer accounts receivable cycles 
because we expect a significant proportion of our revenues to continue to come from international operations  the occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for providing disbursement audit services to commercial clients in the us is rapidly declining 
we currently serve the substantial majority of our us commercial accounts payable services clients using a disbursement audit service model that typically entails acquisition from the client of limited purchase data and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories 
we believe that the market for providing disbursement audit services to commercial entities in the united states is rapidly declining 
our us commercial accounts payable services business is subject to price pressure 
the substantial majority of our domestic commercial accounts payable services clients are currently served using a disbursement audit service model which typically entails obtaining limited purchase data from the client and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories 
the disbursement audit business is highly competitive and barriers to entry are relatively low 
we believe that the low barriers to entry result from limited technology infrastructure requirements  the minimal need for audit data that is difficult to extract from the client s systems  and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories 
as a result of the low barriers to entry  our domestic commercial accounts payable services business is subject to intense price pressure from our competition 
such price pressure could cause our profit margins to decline and have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
proposed legislation by the european union  if enacted as currently drafted  will have a materially adverse impact on meridian s operations 
the european union has currently proposed legislation that would remove the need for suppliers to charge value added taxes on the supply of services to clients within the european union 
it is difficult to estimate whether and or when the proposed legislation would be enacted and implemented 
management believes that the proposed legislation  if enacted as currently drafted  when implemented would have a materially adverse impact on the results of operations of our meridian segment and would also negatively affect our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents meridian may be required to repay grants received from the industrial development authority 
during the period of may through september  meridian received grants from the industrial development authority of ireland  ida  in the sum of million euro million at december  exchange rates 
the grants were paid primarily to stimulate the creation of permanent jobs in ireland 
as a condition of the grants  if the number of permanently employed meridian staff in ireland falls below  then the grants are repayable in full 
this contingency expires on september  as of february   meridian employed permanent employees in dublin  ireland 
as discussed above  proposed eu legislation could eventually have a materially adverse impact on meridian s results of operations 
if meridian s results of operations were to decline as a result of the enactment of that legislation  it is possible that the number of permanent employees that meridian employs in ireland could fall below prior to september should such an event occur  meridian will have to repay the full amount of the grants it previously received from ida 
because of the lengthy approval process required for the legislative proposal to become law and the requirements for numerous systems changes before implementation  management currently estimates that any impact on employment levels related to a possible change in the eu legislation will not be realized until after september  if ever 
as any potential liability related to these grants is not currently determinable  we have not included any expenses related to this matter in our financial statements 
management is monitoring this situation and if it appears probable that meridian s permanent staff in ireland will fall below and that grants will need to be repaid to ida  meridian will recognize an expense at that time 
such expense could be material to meridian s results of operations 
our revenues from certain clients and vat authorities may change markedly from year to year 
we examine merchandise procurements and other payments made by business entities such as manufacturers  distributors and service firms 
to date  services to these types of clients have tended to be either periodic typically  every two or three years or rotational in nature with different divisions of a given client often audited in pre arranged annual sequences 
accordingly  revenues derived from a given client may change markedly from year to year depending on factors such as the size and nature of the client division under audit 
meridian s revenue recognition policy causes its revenues to vary markedly from period to period as well 
meridian defers recognition of revenues to the accounting period in which cash is both received from the foreign governmental agencies reimbursing vat claims and transferred to meridian s clients 
the timing of reimbursement of vat claims by the various european tax authorities with which meridian files claims can differ significantly by country 
changes in the composition of our shareholder population  including those resulting from the issuance of new preferred stock in the exchange offer  are likely to limit our ability to use our net operating losses 
we have substantial tax loss and credit carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result of the implementation of the exchange offer or certain changes in the composition of our shareholder population including purchases or sales of stock by certain shareholders in sufficient amounts  it is likely that our ability to use such carryforwards and certain other tax benefits to offset future income or tax liability will be severely limited under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under such section  our ability to use our existing tax loss and credit carryforwards and certain other tax benefits following an ownership change would be limited to an annual amount generally equal to the product of the fair market value of our stock immediately before the ownership change subject to certain reductions and the long term tax exempt rate in effect for the month in which the ownership change occurs 
for example  if as is probable an ownership change were to occur as a result of the conversion of new securities issued in the exchange  our ability to utilize our pre change carryforwards and possibly certain future deductions to offset future income would be limited to roughly million per year  based on a trading price of our common stock of per share 
based on our current projections  such a limitation would significantly increase our projected future tax liability if combined with the elimination of interest deductions with respect to the new senior convertible notes issued in the exchange whether due to the conversion of such notes into stock or  as discussed below  in the event of a determination that such interest was not deductible 

table of contents recognition of cancellation of debt income as a result of the exchange offer may increase our income tax liability and adversely impact our financial position 
we expect to recognize cancellation of debt income for us federal income tax purposes to the extent the outstanding balance principal plus accrued but unpaid interest of the company s notes due november exceeded the fair market value of the new securities delivered in the exchange offer 
we believe that we will have sufficient consolidated tax loss carryforwards to offset all of the anticipated income for us federal income tax purposes although there may be some liability for federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax 
however  if it were determined that the available tax loss carryforwards were significantly less than the amount estimated or were otherwise limited such as by reason of an annual limitation under section  as discussed above  we could have a significantly greater income tax liability 
we may not be allowed to deduct interest with respect to the new senior convertible notes issued in the exchange offer 
for us federal income tax purposes  no deduction is allowed for interest paid or accrued with respect to convertible debt if it is substantially certain that the holders will voluntarily convert the debt into equity 
the proper application of this provision in the case of the new senior convertible notes is subject to varying interpretations  depending in part on facts and circumstances existing on the exchange date 
we currently intend to take the position that we are entitled to interest deductions in respect of the new senior convertible notes 
nevertheless  there is no assurance that the internal revenue service  irs  would not take a contrary position  or that any change in facts and circumstances would not result in us changing our position 
in addition  even if not disallowed  any interest deductions with the respect to the new senior convertible notes would cease upon an actual conversion of the new senior convertible notes into stock 
future impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets would reduce our future earnings 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and an impairment charge of million relating to our intangible trade name value 
adverse future changes in the business environment or in our ability to perform audits successfully and compete effectively in our market could result in additional impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets or long lived assets  which could materially adversely impact future earnings 
we must perform annual assessments to determine whether some portion  or all  of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long term assets are impaired 
annual impairment testing under sfas no 
could result in a determination that our goodwill or other intangible assets have been further impaired  and annual impairment testing under sfas no 
could result in a determination that our other long lived assets have been impaired 
any future impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets or long lived assets would reduce future earnings 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with other businesses offering recovery audit services  including client internal recovery audit departments 
the recovery audit industry is highly competitive 
our principal competitors for accounts payable recovery audit services include numerous smaller firms 
because these firms tend to be privately owned  we do not have access to their financial statements  so we cannot be certain as to whether we can continue to compete successfully with our competitors 
in recent years  revenues from our core accounts payable recovery audit business have declined  and are expected to continue to decline  due in part to our clients continuing development of their own internal recovery audit capabilities 
in addition  the trend toward more effective internal recovery audit departments diminishes claims available for us to identify in our recovery audits and is likely to continue to negatively impact our future revenues 
our articles of incorporation  bylaws  shareholder rights plan and georgia law may inhibit a change of control that shareholders may favor 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia law contain provisions that may delay  deter or inhibit a future acquisition not approved by our board of directors 
this could occur even if our shareholders receive attractive offers for their shares or if a substantial number  or even a majority  of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to 
table of contents negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction 
provisions that could delay  deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following a classified board of directors  the requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause  specified requirements for calling special meetings of shareholders  and the ability of the board of directors to consider the interests of various constituencies  including our employees  clients and creditors and the local community  in making decisions 
our articles of incorporation also permit the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations  powers  preferences and rights as it determines  without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
in addition  we have in place a poison pill shareholders rights plan that could trigger a dilutive issuance of common stock upon substantial purchases of our common stock by a third party that are not approved by the board of directors 
these provisions also could discourage bids for our shares of common stock at a premium and have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have violated our debt covenants in the past and may do so in the future 
we have violated the debt covenants of our prior senior credit facility on more than one occasion in the past 
our new senior secured credit facility requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with specified financial ratios and other performance covenants 
no assurance can be provided that we will not violate the covenants of our new senior credit facility in the future 
if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants in the future  our lenders could pursue their contractual remedies under the credit facility  including requiring the immediate repayment in full of all amounts outstanding  if any 
additionally  we cannot be certain that  if the lenders demanded immediate repayment of any amounts outstanding  we would be able to secure adequate or timely replacement financing on acceptable terms or at all 
additionally  if the lenders accelerated repayment demand is subsequently made and we are unable to honor it  cross default language contained in the indentures underlying our separately outstanding senior notes and senior convertible notes due march  and any of our untendered convertible notes due november  could also be triggered  potentially accelerating the required repayment of those notes as well 
in such an instance  there can likewise be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional financing that would be required to make such a rapid repayment 
our substantial leverage could materially adversely impact our financial health 
we are highly leveraged 
as of december   our total outstanding debt was approximately million 
as of that date  such total indebtedness was greater than our total capitalization by approximately million 
the instruments governing the new securities issued in the restructuring and the new senior credit facility allow the issuance of additional indebtedness under certain circumstances 
following closing of the financial restructuring transactions  we continue to be highly leveraged 
on a pro forma basis  as of december   we would have had approximately million of outstanding debt and redeemable preferred stock and a maximum of million of additional available borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health by  among other things increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates  particularly with respect to any of our borrowings at variable interest rates  limiting our ability to obtain any additional financing we may need to operate  develop and expand our business  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our debt  which reduces the funds available for operations and future business opportunities  and 
table of contents potentially making us more highly leveraged than our competitors  which could potentially decrease our ability to compete in our industry 
we will have significant interest  dividend  principal and redemption payments under the new securities issued in the exchange offer coming due in the next five years 
our ability to make payments due on the new securities and on our debt will depend upon our future operating performance  which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which we cannot control 
if the cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient  we may take actions such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures  attempting to restructure or refinance our debt  selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital 
some or all of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations and we could be required to file for bankruptcy 
further  we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms  in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  our credit agreements and indentures may limit our ability to take several of these actions 
our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could  among other things  materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq stock market 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors  including issuance of additional common stock on exercise of conversion rights of the new senior convertible notes or the new convertible preferred stock  future announcements concerning us  key clients or competitors  quarterly variations in operating results and liquidity  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  developments with respect to technology or litigation  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to our company  acquisitions and financings  and sales of blocks of stock by insiders 
fluctuations in the stock market  generally  also impact the volatility of our stock price 
general stock market movements may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
we may fail to maintain our listing on the nasdaq stock market  and the value of our stock may be adversely affected if we fail to maintain such listing 
the closing bid price of our common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq stock market  has been below per share for more than consecutive trading days 
on december   we received notice from nasdaq initiating a process to delist our stock 
such process provides for a day period to cure the minimum bid default 
our common stock would have to maintain a closing bid of at least for consecutive trading days during the day period to cure such default 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to cure such default 
in the event that our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq stock market  shares of our common stock would likely trade in the over the counter market on the otc bulletin board or the so called pink sheets 
selling our common stock would be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold and transactions could be delayed 
in addition  securities analysts and news media coverage of us may be further reduced 
these factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common stock 

table of contents if our common stock is deemed a penny stock  its liquidity will be adversely affected 
the market price for our common stock is currently below per share 
if the market price for our common stock remains under per share  our common stock may be deemed to be penny stock 
if our common stock is considered penny stock  it would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practices on broker dealers who sell our securities 
for example  broker dealers must make special suitability determinations for purchasers of penny stock and obtain the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale 
also  broker dealers must deliver disclosure schedules disclosing sales commissions and current quotations for the securities to each purchaser of a penny stock 
broker dealers must also send monthly statements disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the purchaser s account as well as information regarding the limited market in penny stocks 
these rules may cause some broker dealers to choose not to deal in penny stocks  which could have an adverse effect on the price and liquidity of shares of our common stock 
issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our new preferred stock and new senior convertible notes and pursuant to our new management incentive plan will dilute our common stock 
our new convertible notes and new preferred stock  upon full conversion  would represent in excess of a majority of our outstanding common stock  based on the current number of shares of common stock outstanding 
in addition  in order to retain key executive employees  we are adopting a new management incentive plan  pursuant to which certain senior management employees will receive phantom shares of stock that  subject to shareholder approval  will be payable in common stock 
we will reserve of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis  as measured on the dates of distribution  to settle phantom shares under the management incentive plan 
in addition  we may need to issue additional equity securities in the future in order to execute our business plan or for other reasons  which could lead to further dilution to holders of our common stock 
this dilution of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s revenues are based on specific contracts with its clients 
such contracts generally specify a time periods covered by the audit  b nature and extent of audit services to be provided by the company  c the client s duties in assisting and cooperating with the company  and d fees payable to the company  generally expressed as a specified percentage of the amounts recovered by the client resulting from liability overpayment claims identified 
in addition to contractual provisions  most clients also establish specific procedural guidelines that the company must satisfy prior to submitting claims for client approval 
these guidelines are unique to each client and impose specific requirements on the company  such as adherence to vendor interaction protocols  provision of advance written notification to vendors of forthcoming claims  securing written claim validity concurrence from designated client personnel and  in limited cases  securing written claim validity concurrence from the involved vendors 
approved claims are processed by clients and are generally realized by a cash payment or by a reduction to the vendor s accounts payable balance 
the company generally recognizes revenue on the accrual basis except with respect to its meridian vat refunds business meridian and certain international accounts payable services units where revenue is recognized on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recognized for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that the client has received economic value generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors  and when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an existing contractual arrangement between the company and the client exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
in certain limited circumstances  the company will invoice a client prior to meeting all four of these criteria 
in those instances  revenue is deferred until all of the criteria are met 
historically  there has been a certain amount of revenue that  even though meeting the requirements of the company s revenue recognition policy  relates to underlying claims ultimately rejected by the company s clients vendors 
in that case  the company s clients may request a refund of such amount

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
however  certain of the company s accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of its financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
accounting policies that involve the use of estimates that meet both of the following criteria are considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
first  the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate is made 
second  alternate estimates in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely in future periods  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to estimates that meet the critical estimate criteria  the company also makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  refund liabilities  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  information available prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this information forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including changes in those estimates not deemed critical 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this form k have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on the accrual basis except with respect to its meridian vat refunds business  and certain international accounts payable services units where revenue is recognized on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recognized for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that our clients have received economic value generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors  and when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
the determination that each of the aforementioned criteria has been met  particularly the determination of the timing of economic benefit received by the client and the determination that collectibility is reasonably assured  requires the application of significant judgment by management and a misapplication of this judgment could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue 
refund liabilities 
refund liabilities result from reductions in the economic value previously received by the company s clients with respect to vendor claims developed by the company and for which the company has previously recognized revenue 
such refund liabilities are recognized by either offsets to amounts otherwise due from clients or by cash refunds to clients 
the company computes the estimate of its refund liabilities based on historical refund data and records such refunds as a reduction of revenue 
a hypothetical change in refund liabilities would have an impact on operating income of approximately million 

table of contents accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of its clients to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these allowances on a periodic basis 
this evaluation includes  but is not limited to  historical loss experience  the aging of current accounts receivable balances and provisions for adverse situations that may affect a client s ability to pay 
if the evaluation of allowance requirements differs from the actual aggregate allowance  adjustments are made to the allowance 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
if the financial condition of any of the company s clients were to deteriorate  or their operating climates were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if the company s estimate of required allowances for doubtful accounts is determined to be insufficient  it could result in decreased operating income in the period such determination is made 
conversely  if a client subsequently remits cash for an accounts receivable balance which has previously been written off  it could result in increased operating income in the period in which the payment is received 
a hypothetical change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have an impact on operating income of approximately million 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of  as part of its annual intangible asset impairment testing  the company  together with its independent valuation advisors  deloitte financial advisory services llp  performed valuation analyses of its goodwill balances as well as other intangible assets 
as a result of this process  the company determined that non cash  pre tax intangible asset impairment charges totaling million were required during the quarter and year ended december   in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s accounts payable services segment had experienced its third consecutive year of significant declines in revenues and gross profit 
the continuing downward trend in this segment was the single most important factor leading to the necessity of the impairment charge 
this trend is also what necessitated the initiation of the implementation of the company s operational restructuring plan in the third quarter of a similarly derived charge of million was recorded in during the fourth quarter of  the company  working with its independent valuation advisors  completed the required annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this testing  the company concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes 
the company s reported effective tax rates on earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes and discontinued operations approximated   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unusual rate is primarily attributable to the nondeductible portions of the impairment charges discussed above and the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the unusual rate is primarily attributable to the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

table of contents the company s effective tax rate is based on historical and anticipated future taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate reflected in its consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k is different than that reported in its tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the company s tax returns  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the company s tax returns in future years for which it has already recorded the tax benefit in the statement of operations 
the company establishes valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that it believes are more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expense for which a deduction has already been taken on the company s tax returns but has not yet been recognized as an expense in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
in making this determination  management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets  including the company s past and anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the length of carry back and carry forward periods  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists 
cumulative losses in recent years are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination 
in the company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance against its remaining net deferred tax assets of million 
this increase was offset by the use of approximately million of capital loss carry forwards resulting in a net change in the valuation allowance of approximately million 
during the company recorded an additional valuation allowance adjustment of million  bringing the total valuation allowance balance to million 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  included in item of this form k reflects a net current deferred income tax asset of thousand and a net noncurrent deferred tax asset of thousand 
such net deferred tax assets are primarily attributable to operating loss carryforwards available in canada

accounts payable services revenues 
accounts payable services revenues for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions domestic accounts payable services revenue retail commercial international accounts payable services revenue total accounts payable services revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the company continued to experience a decline in revenues for domestic retail wholesale accounts payable services 
the reduction in revenues was primarily attributable to a general reduction in revenue from certain large us audits because fewer claims were processed as a result of improved client processes and the conclusion of several non recurring audits that took place in revenues decreased as the company s clients developed and strengthened their own internal audit capabilities as a substitute for the company s services 
further  the company s clients made fewer transaction errors as a result of the training and methodologies provided by the company as part of the company s accounts payable recovery process 
these trends are expected to continue for the foreseeable future  and as a result  revenues from domestic retail accounts payable services are expected to continue to decline for the foreseeable future 
revenue in benefited from a million increase in revenue from the company s sales and use tax operations as well as a million settlement of past services rendered to an existing client but for which revenues had not been previously recognized 
revenues from the company s domestic commercial accounts payable services clients also continued to decline in compared to the same period of the company believes the market for providing disbursement audit services which typically entail acquisition from the client of limited purchase data and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories to commercial entities in the united states is reaching maturity with fewer audit starts and lower fee rates due to increasing pricing pressures 
in response to the decline in performance for the commercial business  the company has begun to intentionally reduce the number of commercial clients serviced based on profitability  and this trend is expected to continue 
as a result of the foregoing  revenues from domestic commercial accounts payable services are expected to continue to decline for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the company continued to experience a decline in revenues for the international portion of the company s accounts payable services 
the 
table of contents decrease in revenues from international operations was driven by a significant decline in the united kingdom million and a decline in canada million that was partially offset by increases in latin america million 
similar to the us market  lower fee rates and the maturity of the uk market resulted in a declining claim trend as clients improved their payment processes 
the company is facing this unfavorable claim trend in a number of other countries in which it transacts business  and expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   the company experienced a decrease in revenues for domestic retail wholesale accounts payable services  primarily a decrease in base retail audit revenue 
management believes the decrease in base retail audit revenue was largely attributable to clients increased use of their own internal recovery audit functions and continuing changes in the claims approval and processing patterns in some of the company s largest retail accounts 
the company expects many clients to continue to use their own internal recovery audit functions as a substitute for its recovery audit services 
revenues from the company s domestic commercial accounts payable services clients also declined during the year ended december  compared to the same period of the period over period decrease was largely due to fewer audit starts in the first six months of disbursement audit services which typically entail acquisition from the client of limited purchase data and an audit focus on a select few recovery categories have tended to be either one time with no subsequent repeat or rotational in nature with different divisions of a given client often audited in pre arranged annual sequences 
partially offsetting the decreases in accounts payable services revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were a million increase in the company s sales and use tax operations as well as a million settlement for past services rendered to an existing client but for which revenues had not been previously recognized 
these offsetting increases are not expected to be recurring items in future periods 
the decrease in revenues from the international portion of accounts payable services in the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to client specific issues in the company s european operations and a lengthened approval process in the company s canadian operations 
additionally  the company experienced a decrease in revenues for the year ended december  from one large client acquired as part of the january  acquisition of the businesses of howard schultz associates international  inc and affiliates hsa texas for which the company provided airline ticket revenue recovery audit services primarily due to a decrease in claims and an increase in refunds during the period when compared to the same period of the prior year

cor consists principally of commissions paid or payable to the company s auditors based primarily upon the level of overpayment recoveries  and compensation paid to various types of hourly workers and salaried operational managers

contingent obligation to repay industrial development authority of ireland grant during the period of may through september  meridian received grants from the industrial development authority of ireland ida in the sum of million euros million at september  exchange rates 
the grants were paid primarily to stimulate the creation of permanent jobs in ireland 
as a condition of the grants  if the number of permanently employed meridian staff in ireland falls below prior to september   the date the contingency expires  then the grants are repayable in full 
meridian currently employs permanent employees in dublin  ireland 
the european union eu has currently proposed legislation that will remove the need for suppliers to charge vat on the supply of goods and services to clients within the eu 
the effective date of the proposed legislation is currently unknown 
management estimates that the proposed legislation  if enacted as currently drafted  would eventually have a material adverse impact on meridian s results of operations from its value added tax business 
if meridian s results of operations were to decline as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation  it is possible that the number of permanent employees that meridian employs in ireland could fall below prior to september should such an event occur  the full amount of the grants previously received by meridian will need to be repaid to ida 
however  management currently estimates that any impact on employment levels related to a possible change in the eu legislation will not be realized until after september  if ever 
as any potential liability related to these grants is not currently determinable  the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this form k does not include any expense related to this matter 
management is monitoring this situation and if it appears probable meridian s permanent staff in ireland will fall below and that grants will need to be repaid to ida  the company will recognize an expense at that time 
possible limitation on tax loss and credit carryforwards we have substantial tax loss and credit carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result of the implementation of the exchange offer or certain changes in the composition of our shareholder population it is likely that our ability to use such carryforwards and certain other tax benefits to offset future income or tax liability will be severely limited 
based on our current projections  such a limitation would significantly increase our projected future tax liability if combined with the elimination of interest deductions with respect to the new senior convertible notes issued in the exchange offer 
liquidity position the company had outstanding borrowings of million under the prior senior credit facility and million outstanding under the bridge loan at december  additionally  the company had letters of credit of million outstanding at december  as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and approximately million of calculated additional availability for borrowings under the prior senior credit facility for revolving loans  of which up to million was available for letters of credit 
as of march   there were borrowings of million outstanding under the term loan portion of the new senior 
table of contents credit facility 
as of march   the company had million available for revolving loans under the new senior credit facility and no borrowings under the revolver portion of the new credit facility 
management believes that the company will have sufficient borrowing capacity and cash generated from operations to fund its capital and operational needs for at least the next twelve months  however  current projections reflect that the company s core accounts payable business will continue to decline and the company s new senior secured credit facility requires the company to comply with specific financial ratios and other performance covenants 
therefore  the company must successfully implement management s cost reduction plan and grow its other business lines in order to stabilize and increase revenues and improve profitability

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency market risk 
our functional currency is the us dollar although we transact business in various foreign locations and currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the value of nonfunctional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of revenues increases 
overall  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar 
we are therefore adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
interest rate risk 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our debt 
at december   we had fixed rate convertible notes outstanding with a principal amount of million which bore interest at per annum and a million fixed rate bridge loan which bore interest at per annum 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates on variable rate debt during the twelve months ended december  would have resulted in approximately a million change in pre tax income 
as of march   there were borrowings of million outstanding under the term loan portion of the company s new senior credit facility 
as of march   the company had million available for revolving loans under the new senior credit facility and no borrowings under the revolver portion of the new credit facility 
the interest on the term loan is based on a floating rate equal to the reserve adjusted london inter bank offered rate  or libor  plus or  at our option  a published prime lending rate plus 
the interest rate on outstanding revolving credit loans is based on libor plus or  at our option  a published prime lending rate plus 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applicable to the term loan would result in an approximate million change in pre tax income 
assuming full utilization of the revolving credit facility  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applicable to the revolver would result in an approximate million change in pre tax income 
derivative instruments 
as a multi national company  the company faces risks related to foreign currency fluctuations on its foreign denominated cash flows  net earnings  new investments and large foreign currency denominated transactions 
the company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage foreign currency risks 
the use of financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce the risk to the company 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes  nor does it use leveraged financial instruments 
the company did not have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of december  see note f of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k
