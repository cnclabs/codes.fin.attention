years ended december  operating highlights year over year in thousands change revenues income from operations net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities our revenue growth can be attributed to a combination of organic growth and acquisitions 
on an organic level  we are benefiting from an expanding user and advertiser base and from increased user activity levels across our offerings on the yahoo properties 
this revenue growth together with our overall effort to manage discretionary spending has led to the year over year increases in income from operations 
we also continue to acquire companies 
if an acquisition has a significant impact on our revenues and expenses  the revenues and expenses of our acquired business is described as acquisition related in the discussion that follows until the first anniversary of the acquisition date 
thereafter the underlying results of the acquired business are considered part of our organic base 
our historical financial statements reflect the impact of these acquired businesses from their respective dates of acquisition and the discussion of our results of operations that follows explains the material impact of these acquisitions  if any  on our consolidated results to provide information that will assist in understanding the changes in the years presented 
our year over year reported growth rates  calculated on a consolidated basis  include the impact from acquisitions 
excluding the impact from acquisitions  our growth rates would be lower 
our revenue growth for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  can be attributed to an expanding user base and from increased user activity levels across our offerings on the yahoo properties 
the growth in our engaged audience  in terms of the number of users  paying users and activity levels on our properties  including an increasing number of page views  has attracted more advertisers to our advertising services and resulted in an increase in our revenues 
in addition  during we invested over billion in significant acquisitions including business combinations  asset acquisitions and a strategic investment  predominantly internationally  which we believe will position us to benefit from the growing global online advertising market 
cash generated from our operations is a measure of the cash productivity of our business model and is an area of focus for us 
the growth of cash flow from operations is primarily driven by our increasing net income adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  tax benefits from stock options  as well as non operating gains or losses 
in  non operating gains included gains from sales of marketable equity securities and the divestiture of yahoo china in connection with the alibaba transaction 
cash used in investing activities in included our cash consideration for acquisitions  including the strategic investment in alibaba  offset by proceeds from sales of marketable equity securities 
cash used in financing activities in reflected our net cash used for direct stock repurchases and structured stock repurchase transactions offset by cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of employee stock options 
during the year ended december   we recorded gains of approximately million related to sales of non strategic marketable equity securities  and a non cash gain of million related to the divestiture of yahoo china in connection with the alibaba transaction 
these gains of approximately billion are included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
other income  net may fluctuate in future periods due to realized gains and losses on investments  impairments of investments  changes in our average investment balances  and changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 
the provision for income taxes for was million and yielded an effective tax rate of percent for  compared to an effective tax rate of percent for and percent for the lower effective tax rate for was primarily a result of a tax benefit of approximately million related to a subsidiary restructuring transaction completed during we currently expect our effective tax rate to increase in compared to summary we believe the search queries  page views  click throughs and the related marketing services and fees revenues that we generate are correlated to the number and activity level of users across our offerings on the yahoo properties 
by providing a platform for our users that brings together our search technology  content  and community while allowing for personalization and integration across devices  we seek to become more essential to  increase our share of  and deepen the engagement of  our users with our products and services 
we believe this deeper engagement of new and existing users  coupled with the growth of the internet as an advertising medium will increase our revenues in in the following management s discussion and analysis  we discuss the following areas of our financial results results of operations  business segment results  acquisitions  liquidity and capital resources  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  and recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected information on our results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative stock compensation expense amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes  earnings in equity interests  and minority interests provision for income taxes earnings in equity interests minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries net income revenues

we reclassified previously reported marketing services revenue of million and million  respectively  as fees revenue for the years ended december  and in order to refine the alignment of revenue sources with current year classifications 
marketing services revenue 
marketing services revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately  million  or percent  as compared to the prior year 
the year over year growth in our marketing services revenue was primarily organic and can be attributed to a combination of factors that are driving higher advertising revenue across all of the yahoo properties 
we experienced an increase in our user base and activity levels on the yahoo properties  which resulted in a higher volume of search queries  page views  and click throughs 
we believe our increased user audience attracted new advertisers to our portfolio of marketing solutions and contributed to the increase in our marketing services revenue over the prior year 
marketing services revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately  million  or percent  as compared to the growth in our marketing services revenue can be attributed to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth 
incremental revenue from acquisitions contributed approximately  million to the increase in the year ended december  the remainder of the increase  approximately million in was from organic growth in advertising across the yahoo properties as our user base increased 
on the yahoo properties  our estimated number of unique users worldwide as of december  was approximately percent higher than the number of unique users as of december   which was percent higher than december  unique users are the estimated number of people who visited the yahoo properties in a given time period 
the unique user estimate as of december  does not include the unique users of yahoo china as it was divested in october in connection with our strategic investment in alibaba 
if the unique users of yahoo china had been excluded as of december   our estimated unique users as of december  would have been percent higher than as of december  the combined number of page views and searches  including those from our affiliate network  increased by approximately percent in as compared to the prior year 
this growth was primarily organic 
the combined number of page views and searches in  including those from our affiliate network increased by approximately percent as compared to  with approximately percent of the increase in volume attributable to acquisitions 
the increases in the organic volume of page views and searches can be attributed to an increased number of users  an increased number of affiliates  an expanded offering of properties which increased our inventory of page views  and greater market acceptance of our search offerings 
the combined average revenue per page view and search increased by approximately percent in compared to this growth was primarily organic 
the combined average revenue per page view and search increased by approximately percent in compared to  of which approximately one half was attributable to acquisitions 
our combined revenue per page view and search was impacted by sales mix changes from period to period as we expanded our offerings on the yahoo properties and introduced new inventory with differing yields 
we believe our growing number of users  advertisers and inventory has been driving this growth in our marketing services revenues 
we believe our expanding offerings as well as our enhanced algorithmic search technology  which provides a new level of personalization to the search experience  contribute to our growing number of users 
as our user base increases  we generate a higher number of page views  which we view as inventory  and process a higher number of search queries which potentially result in a higher number of impressions and paid clicks 
we also believe that our growing user base makes the yahoo properties more attractive to advertisers and increases their spending on marketing solutions 
further  we believe the growth in users on the yahoo properties and on the internet overall reflects the increasing acceptance  importance and dependence of users on the internet 
as a result of the increasing online audience  we believe advertisers are shifting a greater percentage of their spending from traditional media to the internet to reach this growing audience 
fees revenue 
for the year ended december   fees revenue increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to the prior year 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to acquisitions and million of the increase was associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services  which numbered million as of december  compared to million as of december  our increased base of paying users was due to growth in users across most of our offerings  with the largest growth generated from new internet broadband users in the year 
our fee based services include internet broadband services  sports  music  personals  and premium mail offerings  as well as our services for small businesses 
average monthly revenue per paying user has remained consistent at approximately in and for the year ended december   fees revenue increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to of which million related to acquisitions 
approximately million was associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services  which were million as of december  compared to million as of december  our increasing base of paying users was due to a greater penetration of our services with our existing users as well as our continued expansion of service offerings that took place during the year  including new business relationships with bt and rogers for fee based services 
average monthly revenue per paying user per month declined to approximately in from in due to faster subscriber growth in some of our lower priced offerings  and the introduction of lower priced fee based services

this expense is generally being amortized using the accelerated amortization method in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
the increase in stock compensation expense for the year ended december   was primarily a result of the amortization expense of newly issued equity based awards partially offset by decreased costs associated with options assumed in acquisitions 
the amortization of options assumed in acquisitions has declined as the accelerated amortization method results in declining amortization of awards over their vesting periods and as we have not assumed a significant amount of options in our recent acquisitions 
the increase in stock compensation expense for the year ended december   was primarily a result of a full year of amortization expense relating to stock options assumed in acquisitions  as well as an increase in the issuance of equity based awards during the year

this transaction gave rise to a capital loss for tax purposes  which offset a substantial portion of the gains from sales of equity investments during the year 
the resulting tax benefit was approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was percent compared to percent in the decreased rate resulted primarily from a reduction of million to the valuation allowance for compared to an increase of million for the change in valuation allowance from to was driven primarily by our ability to utilize previously realized capital losses against the capital gain realized on the sale of an investment during we currently expect our effective tax rate to increase in compared to earnings in equity interests

business segment results we manage our business geographically 
our primary areas of measurement and decision making are the united states and international 
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and segment operating income before depreciation and amortization for making financial decisions and allocating resources 
segment operating income before depreciation and amortization includes income from operations before depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense 
management believes that segment operating income before depreciation and amortization is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our segments 
however  this measure should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or superior to  income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

international segment operating income before depreciation and amortization increased approximately million from to  primarily due to the increase in revenues and continued efforts to control discretionary spending 
international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during as compared to percent during and percent during the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won  and australian dollars 
the statements of operations of our international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will increase for our international segment if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating income before depreciation and amortization would have been lower that we reported by million

see note acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to these and other acquisitions 
we expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  businesses  products  and technologies that are complementary to our business  which may require the use of cash 
liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents marketable debt securities total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities percentage of total assets net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities our operating activities for each year in the three years ended december  have generated adequate cash to meet our operating needs 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaling billion  an increase of million compared to billion as of december  the principal components of the increase were cash generated from operating activities of approximately billion  proceeds of billion from sales of marketable equity securities and proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options  offset by cash used for acquisitions and a strategic investment of billion  net cash used in structured stock repurchases activities of million  million used for direct stock repurchases  and net capital expenditures of million 
as of december   approximately million of earnings held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as indefinitely invested outside the united states 
if these funds were required for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes to repatriate these funds 
currently  we do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to our united states operations 
we invest excess cash predominantly in marketable debt securities that are liquid  of high quality investment grade  and the majority of which have effective maturities of less than two years 
we also invest excess cash to support our growing infrastructure needs and expand our operations  as consideration for acquisitions  to repurchase shares of our stock and in other transactions 
as of december   certain of our marketable debt securities had a fair value below cost due to the changes in market rates of interest and yields on these securities 
we evaluate these investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for an anticipated recovery in market value 
we have the intent and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment and expect to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in management believes existing cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including capital expenditures for the next months 
however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position  and the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
cash flow changes cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items  and non operating gains and losses from sales of investments 
non cash adjustments include depreciation and amortization  tax benefits from stock options  earnings in equity interests  stock compensation expense 
in each of the three years ended december    and  operating cash flows were reduced by cash used for working capital needs  most significantly the increase in our accounts receivable balance  mainly reflecting increases in revenues 
the days of sales outstanding metric increased slightly over the three years ended december  in the two years ended december   there were also significant increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities that provided a positive working capital change and cash flow from operations 
these increases were mainly due to higher accrual balances for tac payments to affiliates arising from increased revenue 
cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  net cash consideration for acquisitions including our strategic investment in alibaba and net purchases or sales of marketable debt and equity securities 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures have been primarily for purchases of information technology assets to support our expanding offerings  our increased number of users and our international growth 
our net cash consideration for acquisitions in included approximately billion for our investment in alibaba  million for the purchase of the outstanding interest in our joint ventures in europe and korea and million for the verdisoft acquisition 
the acquisitions of  kelkoo  and musicmatch in and inktomi and overture in were the main uses of the net cash consideration for acquisitions in those years 
sales of equity securities generated cash in the amounts of  million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by used in financing activities is driven by our financing activities relating to employee option exercises  stock repurchases and debt financing 
our cash proceeds from employee option exercises increased to approximately million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively as our employee numbers and the weighted average exercise prices of our options have risen in each successive year 
during  we used million in the direct repurchase of million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
there were no comparable transactions in either or in  we entered into structured stock repurchase transactions resulting in a total cash outlay of  million 
these instruments settle in cash or stock depending on the market price of our common stock on the date of maturity 
this  million cash outlay was offset by cash receipts of million from the settlement of structured stock repurchase transactions in  for a net cash usage of million for these transactions in during  we entered into structured stock repurchase transactions resulting in a total cash outlay of million  which was offset by cash receipts of million from the settlement of structured stock repurchase transactions  for a net cash usage of million for these transactions in we did not have any comparable transactions in financing in april  we issued million of zero coupon senior convertible notes the notes which are due in april these notes are convertible into yahoo common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
each  principal amount of the notes will be convertible prior to april if the market price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time or specified corporate transactions occur 
upon conversion  we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock 
as of december   the market price condition for convertibility of the notes was satisfied with respect to the fiscal quarter beginning january  and ending march  we may be required to repurchase all of the notes following a fundamental change of the company  such as a change of control  prior to maturity at face value 
we may not redeem the notes prior to their maturity 
see note long term debt in the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the long term debt 
stock repurchases in march  following the expiration of the million stock repurchase program that was authorized in and extended in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our outstanding shares of common stock over the next five years  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
repurchases may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a rule b plan 
our board of directors and management believe that additional repurchases made under appropriate market conditions are a prudent use of cash currently available to us in order to enhance long term stockholder value 
in  under the expired and current stock repurchase programs  we repurchased million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for a total amount of million 
subsequent to december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the current stock repurchase program at an average price of per share  for a total amount of million 
structured stock repurchases in  we entered into  million in structured stock repurchase transactions which settle in cash or stock depending on the market price of our common stock on the date of maturity of the transaction 
we enter into these structured stock repurchase transactions as part of our stock repurchase program 
of these transactions  million settled in resulting in cash received of million 
transactions totaling million settled in january resulting in cash received of million 
transactions totaling million settled in february resulting in our repurchase of million shares at an average price of per share 
the remaining tranches totaling million will mature in the second quarter of on each of the maturity dates  if the market price of yahoo common stock is at or above for the million tranche and for the million tranche  we will have our investment returned with a premium 
if the market price of the yahoo common stock is below the pre determined prices  we will repurchase shares of our common stock  up to an aggregate of million shares 
subsequent to december   we entered into million in structured stock repurchase transactions in tranches of million and million  which will mature in july on the maturity dates if the market price of yahoo common stock is at or above for the million tranche and for the million tranche  we will have our investment returned with a premium  otherwise we will repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares 
capital expenditures capital expenditures have generally comprised purchases of computer hardware  software  server equipment and furniture and fixtures 
capital expenditures  net were million in and are expected to continue to increase in as we invest in the expansion of the yahoo properties and its offerings 
this continued increase in capital expenditures  together with the increase in operating lease commitments  is consistent with our increased headcount and operational expansion  and we anticipate that this will continue in the future as business conditions merit 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents certain payments due under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period total due in due in due in thereafter long term debt operating lease obligations affiliate commitments non cancelable obligations total contractual obligations the long term debt matures in april  unless converted into yahoo common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events

we have entered into various non cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices throughout the united states  and for our international subsidiaries with original lease periods up to years and expiring between and see note commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our operating leases 
we are obligated to make payments under contracts to provide search services to our affiliates  which represent traffic acquisition costs 
we are obligated to make payments under various arrangements with vendors and other business partners  principally for marketing  bandwidth and content arrangements 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to the financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
other commitments in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of such agreements  services to be provided by us  or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers and directors of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers and former directors and officers of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements 
on april   overture completed its purchase of the web search unit of fast search and transfer asa  a norway based developer of search and real time filtering technologies  for million in cash  plus a contingent earn out payment of up to million over three years based on specified operating criteria 
the earn out payment is not included in the contractual obligations table 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are generated from marketing services and fees 
marketing services revenue is generated from several offerings including the display of textual  rich media advertisements  display of text based links to the advertiser s website  listing based services  and commerce based transactions 
fees revenue includes revenue from a variety of consumer and business fee based services 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we may enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangements should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from purchase arrangements with our customers for which we can reasonably estimate fair value 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would likely increase stockholders equity as substantially all of our net operating losses result from employee stock option deductions 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger impairment 
see note goodwill in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
based on our impairment test  there would have to be a significant unfavorable change to our assumptions used in such calculations for an impairment to exist 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
we must record an impairment charge on these assets when we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of our other intangible assets which could trigger impairment 
investments in equity interests 
we account for investments in entities in which we can exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
in accounting for these investments we record our proportionate share of these companies net income or loss  one quarter in arrears 
we review all of our investments in equity interests for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
the impairment review requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment 
the determination of the fair value of the investment involves considering the following factors the stock prices of public companies in which we have an equity investment  current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and undiscounted cash flows  quoted stock prices of comparable public companies  and other company specific information including recent financing rounds 
the fair value determination  particularly for investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method supplemented by pro forma disclosures is no longer permissible 
we adopted the new requirements using the modified prospective method in the first quarter of sfas r also requires excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options to be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity rather than an operating activity  as currently presented 
for purposes of pro forma disclosure of share based compensation expense under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  we have applied the accelerated amortization method outlined in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
upon adoption of sfas r  we will continue to amortize stock compensation expense related to options granted on or before december  using the accelerated method 
for options granted after december   we will amortize stock compensation expense using the straight line method 
we expect the adoption of sfas r to result in stock compensation expense and therefore a reduction of income before income taxes  earnings in equity interests and minority interests in of approximately million 
our actual stock compensation expense amount could differ materially from this estimate depending on the timing and magnitude of new awards  the number and mix of new awards  changes in the market price or the volatility of our common stock  as well as unanticipated changes in our workforce 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
previously  voluntary changes in accounting principles were generally required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had investments in debt securities with effective maturities between three months and one year of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments in debt securities with effective maturities between one and five years of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million decrease approximately percent  respectively  in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities as of december  and the fair market value of the zero coupon senior convertible notes the notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes will also increase as the market price of the yahoo stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december  and  the fair value of the notes was approximately billion based on quoted market prices 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during as compared to percent during the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won and australian dollars 
the statements of operations of our international operations are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will increase for our international segment  if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating income before depreciation and amortization would have been lower than we reported by million 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating income before depreciation and amortization would have been lower than we reported by million 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into united states dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
during  we recorded foreign currency transaction losses  realized and unrealized  of approximately million as compared to gains of million and million in and  respectively  which were recorded in other income  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
investment risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and current and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  and  net unrealized losses on these investments were not material 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized gains and losses from the sale of investments  as well as impairment charges on some of our investments 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million on an available for sale equity investment 
our investments in available for sale equity securities were not material as of december  as of december   we had available for sale equity investments with a fair value of approximately million  classified as current assets and included on the consolidated balance sheets as marketable equity securities 
these equity investments were sold in our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
using a hypothetical reduction of percent in the stock price of these equity securities  the fair value of our equity investments would decrease by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
