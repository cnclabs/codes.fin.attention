amounts available under the credit facility are limited to of the company s earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve months

the combined net cash flows from operations and pawn and short term advance receivables totaled  for fiscal the profitability and liquidity of the company is affected by the amount of pawn loans outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s lending decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of pawn redemptions by increasing or decreasing the amount pawned in relation to the resale value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate pawn balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service fees 
additionally  small advances in relation to the pledged property s estimated resale value tend to increase pawn redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing larger pawns in relation to the estimated resale value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
also  larger average pawn balances can result in an increase in pawn forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
the company s renewal policy allows customers to renew pawns by repaying all accrued service fees on such pawns  effectively creating a new pawn transaction 
the amount of short term advances outstanding and related potential loss provision expense also affect the profitability and liquidity of the company 
an allowance for losses is provided on active short term advances and service fees receivable  based upon expected default rates  net of estimated future recoveries of previously defaulted short term advances and service fees receivable 
the company considers short term advances to be in default if they are not repaid on the due date  and writes off the principal amount and service fees receivable as of the default date  leaving only active receivables in the reported balances 
net defaults and changes in the short term advance allowance are charged to the short term advance loss provision 
in addition to these factors  merchandise sales and the pace of store expansions affect the company s liquidity 
management believes that the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to accommodate the company s current operations for fiscal the company has no significant capital commitments 
the company currently has no written commitments for additional borrowings or future acquisitions  however  the company intends to continue to grow and may seek additional capital to facilitate expansion 
the company will evaluate acquisitions  if any  based upon opportunities  acceptable financing  purchase price  strategic fit and qualified management personnel 
the company currently intends to continue to engage in a plan of expansion primarily through new store openings 
during fiscal  the company currently plans to open approximately to new stores  comprised of both payday advance locations  primarily located in texas and michigan  and pawnshops  primarily in mexico 
this expansion is expected to be funded entirely through operating cash flows 
while the company continually looks for and is presented with potential acquisition candidates  the company has no definitive plans or commitments for further acquisitions 
if the company encounters an attractive opportunity to acquire new stores in the near future  the company will seek additional financing  the terms of which will be negotiated on a case by case basis 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for fiscal totaled  an increase of compared to  for fiscal the ebitda margin  which is ebitda as a percentage of revenues  for fiscal was  compared to for the comparable prior year period 
ebitda is commonly used by investors to assess a company s leverage capacity  liquidity and financial performance 
ebitda is not considered a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing the company s financial performance 
since ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the company s consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity 
non gaap measures should be evaluated in conjunction with  and are not a substitute for  gaap financial measures

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the amount of pawns and short term advances made or unredeemed goods sold by the company  or its results of operation 
seasonality the company s retail business is seasonal in nature with its highest volume of merchandise sales occurring during the first and fourth calendar quarters of each year

recent accounting pronouncements see discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company is potentially exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk in regards to its long term line of credit 
as of march   the line of credit did not have an outstanding balance  therefore  the company s interest rate risk for is immaterial 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts 
accordingly  the company is subject to changes in market interest rates 
however  the company does not believe a change in these rates would have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition  or cash flows 
foreign currency risk the company bears certain exchange rate risks from its operations in mexico as approximately  of the company s pawn loans in mexico at december  were contracted and expected to be settled in mexican pesos 
the company also maintained certain peso denominated bank balances at december   which converted to a us dollar equivalent of  a increase in the peso to us dollar exchange rate would increase the company s foreign currency translation exposure on its pawn loan balance and cash by approximately  and  respectively 
gold price risk a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of jewelry inventories held by the company and the value of jewelry pledged as collateral by pawn customers 
as a result  the company s profit margins on existing jewelry inventories would be negatively impacted  as would be the potential profit margins on jewelry currently pledged as collateral by pawn customers in the event it is forfeited by the pawn customer 
in addition  a decline in gold prices could result in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company  as customers would receive lower loan amounts for individual pieces of jewelry 
the company believes that many customers would be willing to add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount  thus mitigating a portion of this risk
