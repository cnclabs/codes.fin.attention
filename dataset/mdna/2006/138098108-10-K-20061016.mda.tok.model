on july   our wholly owned subsidiary carsen group inc carsen closed the sale of substantially all of its assets to olympus america inc and certain of its affiliates collectively  olympus under an asset purchase agreement dated as of may  among carsen  cantel and olympus 
olympus purchased substantially all of carsen s assets other than those related to carsen s medivators business and certain other smaller product lines 
following the closing  olympus hired substantially all of carsen s employees and took over carsen s olympus related operations as well as the operations related to the other acquired product lines 
the transaction resulted in an after tax gain of approximately  and was recorded separately on the consolidated statements of income as gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax 
in connection with the transaction  carsen s medivators related assets as well as certain of its other assets that were not acquired by olympus were sold to our new canadian distributor of medivators products 
as a result of the foregoing transaction  which coincided with the expiration of carsen s exclusive distribution agreements with olympus on july   carsen no longer has any remaining product lines or active business operations 
the businesses of carsen  previously reported in the endoscopy and surgical  endoscope reprocessing and all other reporting segments  are reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements and have been excluded from segment results for all periods presented 
net sales  cost of sales  operating expenses  interest expense and income taxes attributable to carsen s operations have been aggregated into a single line  income from discontinued operations  net of tax  on the consolidated statements of income

ii as a result of our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august   we commenced the sale and service of our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment  high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables through our own united states field sales and service organization on august   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  business reporting segments endoscope reprocessing 
and business risk factors 
iii thedialysisindustry has been undergoing significant consolidation which has adversely impacted the average selling price of some of our dialysis products and may continue to adversely affect our business  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  in business competition and in business risk factors 
iv on august   which is the beginning of our fiscal  we acquired crosstex international inc crosstex  as more fully described in business reporting segments dental and note to the consolidated financial statements 
v in conjunction with the crosstex acquisition  we amended and restated our united states credit facilities on august   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
vi a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar impacted our results of operations during fiscal compared with fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
the increase in value was approximately for fiscal compared with fiscal  based upon average exchange rates reported by banking institutions 
vii a weaker euro against the united states dollar impacted our results of operations during fiscal  compared with fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
the decrease in value was approximately for fiscal compared with fiscal  based upon average exchange rates reported by banking institutions 
viii on may   we acquired certain of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of fluid solutions  inc as more fully described in business recent developments and note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the results of operations reflect the continuing operating results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries  but exclude the operating results of carsen 
since the crosstex acquisition occurred on august   crosstex is reflected in our results of operations for fiscal  and is not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal and fiscal certain distribution and warehouse expenses of crosstex have been reclassified from amounts previously reported in our quarterly form q s to conform with the accounting policies of cantel which require such costs to be classified as cost of sales 
these reclassifications affect cost of sales  gross profit and selling expenses of our dental segment  and therefore our consolidated amounts 
for fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to all of our reporting segments with the exception of dental since this entire reporting segment is related to the crosstex acquisition as well as the discontinued operations of carsen 
since the saf t pak acquisition occurred on june   saf t pak is reflected in our results of operations for fiscal  fiscal and for the last two months of fiscal the acquisition of saf t pak added the specialty packaging operating segment  which is included in the all other reporting segment 
for fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to the dialysis  endoscope reprocessing  and water purification and filtration reporting segments and the therapeutic filtration operating segment  which is included in the all other reporting segment  but excludes the impact of the saf t pak acquisition as well as the discontinued operations of carsen 
the following table gives information as to the net sales from continuing operations and the percentage to the total net sales from continuing operations for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands dialysis dental water purification and filtration endoscope reprocessing all other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  for fiscal compared with fiscal net sales contributed by our dental segment in fiscal were  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
in addition  net sales were negatively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of euro net sales primarily of our dialysis operating segment using a weaker euro against the united states dollar 
increases in selling prices of our products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal however  as discussed below  we experienced a reduction in our dialysis net sales and profit margins in fiscal due to reduced average selling prices attributable to the davita gambro us acquisition 
the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of water purification and filtration products and services and endoscope reprocessing products and services 
these increases in net sales were partially offset by decreases in sales of dialysis products and therapeutic products 
the increase in sales of water purification and filtration products and services of  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to increased demand in north america for our water purification and filtration equipment  and was partially attributable to the restructuring  strengthening  and consolidation of our sales and marketing organization 
additionally  we acquired certain of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of fluid solutions  inc on may  which resulted in approximately  of incremental net sales in fiscal the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services of in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to an increase in demand for our endoscope disinfection equipment  disinfectants and product service both in the united states and internationally 
the increase in demand for our disinfectants and product service is attributable to the increased field population of equipment including our dyped endoscope disinfection equipment in europe and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
sales of dialysis products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a decrease in demand from domestic and international customers for dialysate concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment and renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment both in the united states and internationally  and lower average selling prices for renatron equipment and renalin sterilant due to increased sales to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing 
partially offsetting the decrease in sales of dialysis products and services was an increase of approximately  in net sales as a result of shipping and handling fees  such as freight  invoiced to customers during fiscal related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales 
during fiscal  two of our largest customers were responsible for transportation related to the products they purchased from us  in fiscal  these two customers requested that we undertake and invoice them for such transportation 
the dialysis industry has been undergoing significant consolidation through the acquisition by certain major dialysis chains of smaller chains and independents 
in october  davita inc davita  the second largest dialysis chain in the united states  acquired gambro ab s united states dialysis clinic business  gambro healthcare  inc gambro us 
davita and gambro us are significant customers of our dialysis reuse products and accounted for approximately of our dialysis net sales during fiscal the davita gambro us acquisition has resulted in greater buying power for the larger resulting entity and thereby a reduction in our net sales and profit margins due to reduced average selling prices of our dialyzer reprocessing products 
in addition  on march   fresenius medical care fresenius  the largest dialysis chain in the united states and a provider of single use dialyzer products  announced the closing of its acquisition of renal care group  inc rcg 
rcg has been a significant customer of our dialysis reuse products 
combined net sales of fresenius and rcg accounted for approximately of our dialysis net sales during fiscal we anticipate fresenius will convert all or substantially all of the dialysis clinics of rcg into single use facilities  which will adversely affect our sales of dialysis products 
given the uncertainty of the post acquisition operating strategies for fresenius rcg  we are currently unable to determine the timing and impact on our future sales of dialysis products and services 
in addition  the davita and fresenius acquisitions have resulted in the loss of low margin dialysate concentrate business since gambro and fresenius manufacture dialysate concentrate themselves 
consequently  the davita and rcg dialysis centers have reduced their purchases of dialysate concentrate from us 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  a decrease of  or in fiscal compared with fiscal this decrease in sales was primarily due to reduced sales in the united states of pediatric filters  manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system  due to a voluntary recall of the system unrelated to our product by such customer 
we anticipate that sales to the manufacturer will recommence in the near future 
the reduction was also due to decreases in demand for our hemoconcentrator products a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and hemofilter products a product that performs a slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients who cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis  both in the united states and internationally 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business decreased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit contributed by our dental segment in fiscal was  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for our dental segment in fiscal was  which was adversely impacted by a  one time purchase accounting charge related to our dental segment s inventory during the three months ended october  excluding this one time charge  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for our dental segment in fiscal was 
the lower gross profit percentage from our pre existing business in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a lower gross profit percentage on our dialysis products due to lower average selling prices on dialysate concentrate  renatron equipment and sterilants principally as a result of increased sales to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing  unfavorable overhead absorption associated with the decrease in sales to domestic and international customers  and higher distribution costs 
additionally  gross profit percentage for fiscal was adversely impacted by the sale of some large water purification and filtration systems at lower than normal margins 
with respect to the reduction in gross profit as opposed to gross profit percentage  the loss in gross profit attributable to decreases in net sales as explained above  as well as the aforementioned reasons for the reduction in gross profit percentage  constitute the most significant factors in the decrease in gross profit 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the inclusion of  of our dental segment s selling expenses  the initial cost of  to develop our endoscope reprocessing direct sales and service network as a result of our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august   as more fully described elsewhere is this md a  an increase in salary expense of approximately  in our specialty packaging operating segment primarily for the increase in our sales and marketing personnel  the recording of  of stock based compensation expense in fiscal  and the translation of canadian expenses in our water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which resulted in an additional  of selling expenses 
partially offsetting the increase in selling expenses were decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry since an increasing percentage of sales of our dialysis products are to major dialysis chains as compared to small chains and independent dialysis clinics 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the lower selling cost structure of our dental segment which such selling expenses as a percentage of our dental segment net sales were in fiscal and decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry  partially offset by the initial cost of  to develop our endoscope reprocessing direct field sales and service organization 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the inclusion of  of our dental segment s general and administrative expenses which such expenses include  of amortization associated with intangible assets  the recording of  of stock based compensation expense in fiscal   in incentive compensation during the three months ended october  directly related to the crosstex acquisition  the translation of canadian expenses in our water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which resulted in an additional  of general and administrative expenses   in debt financing costs during the three months ended october  related to our amended and restated credit facilities  and the inclusion of  of fluid solution s general and administrative expenses for the three month period subsequent to the may  acquisition 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the aforementioned factors 
research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the majority of our research and development expenses related to our dyped endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to ongoing research and development on those products 
interest in fiscal  interest expense increased by  to  from  in fiscal primarily due to the significant increase in average outstanding borrowings as a result of financing a portion of the purchase price of the august  acquisition of crosstex 
interest income increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to an increase in average interest rates in fiscal and a higher average cash balance 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
we have provided income tax expense for our united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of us federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards nols accumulated in the united states 
our nols were fully utilized during the three months ended october  our results of continuing operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for our international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
such international subsidiaries include our subsidiaries in canada and japan  which had effective tax rates in fiscal of approximately and  respectively 
a partial income tax benefit was recorded in fiscal on the losses from operations at our netherlands subsidiary 
the higher overall effective tax rate for fiscal compared with fiscal is principally due to the geographic mix of pretax income  an increase in the statutory united states tax rate to from  an increase in our overall state income tax rate to approximately from due to the crosstex acquisition  losses related to our netherlands operation for which only a partial income tax benefit was recorded and stock based compensation during fiscal for which only a partial income tax benefit was recorded including our canadian operations which no tax benefit was recorded  partially offset by the domestic production deduction resulting from the american jobs creation act of stock based compensation on august   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment revised sfas r using the modified prospective method for the transition 
under the modified prospective method  stock based compensation expense will be recognized for any option grant or stock award granted on or after august   as well as the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to august   based upon the award s fair value 
for fiscal and earlier periods  we have accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under which stock compensation expense is not recognized because we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income in fiscal year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses discontinued operations stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax most of our stock options are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the option award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for options subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to total nonvested stock options was  at july  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
for the year ended july   we recorded stock based compensation expense in the amount of  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from net income by with a corresponding increase to additional capital  partially offset by the related income tax benefits of  which pertain to options that do not qualify as incentive stock options with a corresponding increase in long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities 
if certain criteria are met when an option is exercised  the company is allowed a deduction on our income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as additional capital assuming deferred tax assets do not exist pertaining to the exercised stock options and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscal  option exercises resulted in income tax deductions that reduced income taxes payable by  at july  prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
beginning august   we changed our cash flow presentation in accordance with sfas r  which requires the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
in fiscal   in excess tax benefits were shown as financing cash flows in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense including tax benefits on stock compensation expense that has only been reflected in the pro forma disclosures which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
in fiscal  we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options previously awarded to certain executive officers and other employees individuals in total under our employee stock option plan 
such options had exercise prices greater than  the closing price on june   the date that our board of directors authorized such acceleration 
options to purchase  shares of common stock of which approximately  shares are subject to options held by executive officers were subject to this acceleration 
all other terms and conditions of the options remain in effect 
options held by non employee directors were not included in the acceleration 
because these options had exercise prices in excess of the market value of cantel common stock on june   and therefore were not fully achieving our original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention  we expect the acceleration may have a positive effect on employee morale  retention and perception of option value 
the acceleration eliminated any future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our income statement with respect to these options with the august  implementation of sfas r 
the compensation expense  after tax  related to this acceleration totaled approximately  if such acceleration did not occur  we would have recognized additional compensation expense  net of tax  of approximately    and  in fiscal   and  respectively  based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date over the original vesting period 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  for fiscal from  in fiscal net sales contributed by saf t pak in fiscal and the last two months of fiscal were  and  respectively 
net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian net sales of our water purification and filtration reporting segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of our netherlands subsidiary net sales using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
the majority of the net sales of our netherlands subsidiary are included in the dialysis reporting segment 
increases in selling prices of our products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services  dialysis products and therapeutic products 
these increases in net sales were partially offset by a small decrease in sales of water purification and filtration products 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services of in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to an increase in sales of disinfectants  consumables and product service  both in the united states and internationally 
the increase in sales of these products can be attributed to the increased field population of equipment including our dyped endoscope disinfection equipment in europe and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
sales of dialysis products and services increased by in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in customer demand in the united states and by an international customer for dialysate concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment and an increase in domestic demand for dialysis supplies 
partially offsetting the increase in sales were lower average selling prices for our renalin sterilant product due to increased sales to large national chains that typically receive lower prices 
the dialysis industry has been undergoing significant consolidation through the acquisition by certain major dialysis chains of smaller chains and independents 
in october  davita inc davita  the second largest dialysis chain in the united states  acquired gambro ab s united states dialysis clinic business  gambro healthcare  inc gambro us 
in addition  in may  fresenius medical care ag fresenius  the largest dialysis chain in the united states and a provider of single use dialyzer products  announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire renal care group  inc rcg 
davita  gambro us  and rcg are significant customers of our dialysis reuse products 
if fresenius s acquisition is consummated  and if fresenius converts all or substantially all of the dialysis clinics of rcg into single use facilities  our sales of dialysis products will be adversely affected 
in addition  the consolidation of dialysis providers could result in greater buying power by the larger resulting entities and thereby a reduction in our net sales and profit margins due to reduced average selling prices of dialysis products 
however  given the uncertainty of the post acquisition operating strategies with respect to these two transactions and the potential regulatory required divesture of some of their dialysis clinics  we are currently unable to determine the impact on our future sales of dialysis products and services 
sales in the all other reporting segment increased in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment in fiscal were  an increase of  compared with the last two months of fiscal subsequent to the date of the acquisition 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales of therapeutic products was primarily due to an increase in customer demand for our pediatric filters in the united states and domestic and international demand for our hemofilters a device that performs a slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients who cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis 
sales of water purification and filtration products and services decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the recognition of certain large low margin water purification equipment sales during fiscal  which orders had been accepted prior to the acquisition of biolab 
after the acquisition was completed  we made a decision not to sell our water purification equipment at such a low margin  thereby resulting in lower but more profitable sales 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases in demand for our water filtration products in the united states and international sales of our new minncare dry fog disinfection system 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by saf t pak in fiscal and the last two months of fiscal were  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was  compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales for saf t pak in fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the higher gross profit percentage from our pre existing business in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to improved overhead absorption due to increased sales volume as well as favorable sales mix in our endoscope reprocessing and therapeutic filtration reporting segments 
partially offsetting these increases in gross profit percentage was a lower gross profit percentage on our dialysis products due to sales mix as we sold more dialysate concentrate products and a lower average selling price on dialysate concentrate as a result of increased sales to large national chains that typically receive lower prices 
the favorable canadian dollar exchange rates lowered the cost of inventory purchased from suppliers in the united states by our canadian division of our water purification and filtration operating segment  and therefore decreased cost of sales and increased gross profit  by approximately  in fiscal compared with fiscal in addition  gross profit was positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of gross profit using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which also impacts net sales and therefore has no impact on gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
similarly  gross profit was positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of our netherlands subsidiary gross profit using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the inclusion of an additional  of saf t pak s selling expenses for fiscal as compared with the last two months of fiscal and increases in commissions and incentive compensation except in our dialysis reporting segment due to improved operating results 
partially offsetting the increase in selling expenses were decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry since an increasing percentage of our sales of our dialysis products are to major dialysis chains as compared to small chains and independent dialysis clinics 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of increased net sales against the fixed component of selling expenses  and decreases in sales and marketing personnel and commissions in our dialysis reporting segment in response to the consolidation of the dialysis industry 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the inclusion of an additional  of saf t pak s general and administrative expenses for fiscal as compared with the last two months of fiscal  increased accounting and consulting costs of approximately  relating to corporate governance sarbanes oxley compliance and the annual audit of our financial statements  an increase in incentive compensation of approximately  an increase of approximately  due to additional executive personnel  and the translation of canadian expenses relating to our water purification and filtration segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which resulted in an additional  of general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in bad debt expense due to the collection of several delinquent receivables and a  provision for legal claims recorded during fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the majority of research and development expenses for fiscal and fiscal related to the dyped endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
interest in fiscal  interest expense decreased by  to  from  in fiscal  principally due to the decrease in average outstanding borrowings  partially offset by an increase in average interest rates 
interest income increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  principally due to an increase in cash available for short term investments 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
we have provided income tax expense for our united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of united states federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the federal net operating loss carryforwards nols accumulated in the united states 
at july   such federal net operating loss carryforwards were approximately  since these nols will be fully utilized in fiscal  we will be making payments of united states federal income taxes during fiscal our united states effective tax rate was during fiscal compared with during fiscal our results of operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for our international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
such international subsidiaries include our subsidiaries in canada  and japan  which had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately and  respectively 
in fiscal and  our netherlands subsidiary had an overall loss primarily due to research and development expenses attributable to the dyped product line for which no corresponding tax benefit was recorded 
as a result  our consolidated effective tax rate of is higher than our united states and canadian effective tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at july   our working capital was  compared with  at july  this decrease was primarily due to the use of cash to repay  of our outstanding borrowings during fiscal  most of which had been classified as long term debt during the year 
the funds utilized to repay such debt came principally from proceeds from the disposal of the discontinued operations as well as earnings from our continuing operations 
partially offsetting these items was the acquisition of crosstex  which contributed  in working capital at august   the date of acquisition such crosstex net assets were reduced by  at july  due to the recording of an earnout payable to the former crosstex sellers 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  gain on sale of discontinued operations and deferred income taxes  and decreases in accounts receivable due to a decrease in net sales primarily in our dialysis segment  partially offset by an increase in inventories due to timing of sales and a decrease in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations due to the sale of substantially all of carsen s assets on july  
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization  and deferred income taxes and an increase in accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrued expenses due primarily to increased incentive compensation payable as a result of improved operating results  partially offset by an increases in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales and net assets of discontinued operations due to strong operating results at carsen 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization  and deferred income taxes and an increase in income taxes payable  partially offset by increases in net assets of discontinued operations due to strong operating results at carsen 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of crosstex and capital expenditures  partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of our discontinued operations 
in fiscal  the net cash used in investing activities was primarily for capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisitions of biolab  mar cor  dyped and saf t pak and capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal  compared with net cash used in financing activities of  in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to borrowings under our credit facilities related to the acquisition of crosstex  net of debt issuance costs  and proceeds from the exercises of options  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities and the purchase of treasury stock 
in fiscal  the net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to repayments under our credit facilities  partially offset by exercises of stock options 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to borrowings under our credit facilities related to the acquisitions of mar cor and saf t pak  net of debt issuance costs  and proceeds from the exercises of stock options  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities 
discontinued operations termination of carsen s operations on july   carsen closed the sale of substantially all of its assets to olympus under an asset purchase agreement dated as of may  among carsen  cantel and olympus 
olympus purchased substantially all of carsen s assets other than those related to carsen s medivators business and certain other smaller product lines 
following the closing  olympus hired substantially all of carsen s employees and took over carsen s olympus related operations as well as the operations related to the other acquired product lines 
the transaction resulted in an after tax gain of approximately  and was recorded separately on the consolidated statements of income as gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax 
in connection with the transaction  carsen s medivators related assets as well as certain of its other assets that were not acquired by olympus were sold to our new canadian distributor of medivators products 
the purchase price for the net assets sold to olympus was approximately  comprised of a fixed sum of  plus an additional formula based sum of  in addition  olympus will pay carsen of olympus revenues attributable to carsen s unfilled customer orders as of july  that were assumed by olympus at the closing 
such payments to carsen currently anticipated to be approximately  will be made following olympus receipt of customer payments for such orders 
the  fixed portion of the purchase price was in consideration for i carsen s customer lists  sales records  and certain other assets related to the sale and servicing of olympus products and certain non olympus products distributed by carsen  ii the release of olympus contractual restriction on hiring carsen personnel  iii real property leases which were assumed or replaced by olympus and leasehold improvements  computer and software systems  equipment and machinery  telephone systems  and records related to the acquired assets  and iv assisting olympus in effecting a smooth transition of carsen s business of distributing and servicing olympus and certain non olympus products in canada 
cantel has also agreed on behalf of itself and its affiliates not to manufacture  distribute  sell or represent for sale in canada through july  any products that are competitive with the olympus products formerly sold by carsen under its olympus distribution agreements 
the  formula based portion of the purchase price was based on the book value of carsen s inventories of olympus and certain non olympus products and the face amount of carsen s accounts receivable and certain other assets  all at july   subject to offsets  particularly for accounts payable of carsen due to olympus 
net proceeds from carsen s sale of net assets and the termination of carsen s operations were approximately  excluding the backlog payments after satisfaction of remaining liabilities and taxes 
as a result of the foregoing transaction  which coincided with the expiration of carsen s exclusive distribution agreements with olympus on july   carsen no longer has any remaining product lines or active business operations 
the net sales and operating income attributable to carsen s business inclusive of both olympus and non olympus business  but exclusive of the sale of medivators reprocessors constitute the entire endoscopy and surgical reporting segment and scientific operating segment  which historically was included within the all other reporting segment 
operating segment information and net income attributable to carsen s business is summarized below year ended july  net sales endoscopy and surgical endoscope reprocessing scientific total operating income endoscopy and surgical endoscope reprocessing scientific interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of discontinued operations income taxes gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax prior to being reported as discontinued operations  fiscal net sales and operating income of carsen accounted for approximately and of our fiscal consolidated net sales and operating income  respectively 
cash flows attributable to discontinued operations comprise the following year ended july  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities financing activities of our discontinued operations did not result in any net cash in fiscal  and direct sale of medivators systems in the united states on august   we commenced the sale and service of our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment  high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables through our own united states field sales and service organization 
our direct sale of these products is the result of our decision that it is in our best long term interests to control and develop our own direct hospital based united states distribution network and  as such  not to renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august  throughout the former distribution arrangement with olympus  we employed our own personnel to provide clinical sales support activities as well as an internal technical and customer service function  depot maintenance and service and all logistics and distribution services for the medivators olympus customer base 
this existing and fully developed infrastructure will continue to be a critical factor in our new direct sales and service strategy 
during fiscal  we incurred  to develop our field sales and service organization in preparation for the august  implementation of our new sales and service strategy 
during the seven year period following the expiration of the distribution agreement with olympus on august   olympus will have the option to provide certain ongoing support functions to its existing customer base of medivators products  subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement 
in addition  olympus may continue to purchase from minntech for resale in connection with such support functions  medivators accessories  consumables  and replacement and repair parts  as well as rapicide disinfectant 
long term contractual obligations aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long term components are as follows year ended july  amounts in thousands thereafter total maturities of the credit facilities expected interest payments under the credit facilities minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases minimum commitments under noncancelable capital leases note payable dyped deferred compensation and other employment agreements total contractual obligations the expected interest payments under the credit facilities reflect an interest rate of  which was our weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at september  credit facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of crosstex  we entered into amended and restated credit facilities dated as of august  the us credit facilities with a consortium of united states lenders to fund the cash consideration paid in the acquisition and costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to modify our existing united states credit facilities 
the us credit facilities include i a six year million senior secured amortizing term loan facility and ii a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
in addition  we agreed to repay the july  outstanding borrowings of  under our original term loan facility within ninety days from the closing 
in october  such amount was repaid primarily through the repatriation of funds from our foreign subsidiaries 
amounts we repay under the term loan facility may not be re borrowed 
additionally  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately  of which  of third party costs was recorded in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended october  in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
the remaining  of costs was recorded in other assets and will be amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
borrowings under the us credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and as further adjusted under the terms of the us credit facilities ebitda 
at september   the lender s base rate was and the libor rates ranged from to 
the margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings at september  were above the lender s base rate and above libor 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at september  the us credit facilities also provide for fees on the unused portion of our facilities at rates ranging from to  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda  such rate was at september  the us credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants and are secured by i substantially all of our us based assets including assets of cantel  minntech  mar cor and crosstex and ii our pledge of all of the outstanding shares of minntech  mar cor and crosstex and of the outstanding shares of our foreign based subsidiaries 
in june  crosstex obtained a  euro standby letter of credit from its former bank relating to a fixed asset being constructed for crosstex 
subsequent to july   a waiver was received from our lenders permitting the standby letter of credit 
we are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the us credit facilities 
on july   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the us credit facilities all of which was under the united states term loan facility 
in july  we terminated our canadian based senior secured revolving credit facility with a canadian bank due to the july  sale of substantially all of carsen s assets 
operating leases minimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space and equipment 
rent expense related to operating leases for fiscal was recorded on a straight line basis and aggregated  including rent expense attributable to our dental segment of approximately  compared with  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal  and amounts exclude rent expense related to our discontinued operations 
capital leases minimum commitments under capital leases are for four trucks used in our water purification and filtration business 
the aggregate cost of the four trucks was approximately  at july  and  the net book value included in property and equipment was approximately  and  respectively 
dyped note payable and other long term liabilities in conjunction with the dyped acquisition on september   we issued a note with a face value of   using the exchange rate on the date of the acquisition 
at july   approximately  of this note was outstanding using the exchange rate on july  such note is non interest bearing and has been recorded at its present value of  at july  the current portion of this note is recorded in accrued expenses and the remainder is recorded in other long term liabilities 
also included in other long term liabilities are deferred compensation arrangements for certain former minntech directors and officers 
financing needs in fiscal  we repatriated  of existing accumulated profits from our international subsidiaries  of which  came from our discontinued operations 
most of such repatriations were used for debt repayment 
at july   we had a cash balance of  we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  and the funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations 
at september   the entire  under our united states revolving credit facility was available 
repurchase of shares in april  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
under the repurchase program we repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing prices and as permitted by applicable securities laws including sec rule b and new york stock exchange requirements  and subject to market conditions 
the repurchase program has a one year term ending april  the first purchase under our repurchase program occurred on april  through july   we had completed the repurchase of  shares under the repurchase program 
the following table summarizes the repurchase of common stock under the repurchase program during fiscal total number maximum number of shares average price of shares that may yet be purchased month paid per share purchased under the program april may june july through september   we had completed the purchase of  shares under the repurchase program at a total average price per share of 
therefore  at september   the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program are  shares 
foreign currency during fiscal compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect our results of operations principally for the following reasons i our canadian subsidiaries which are included in the specialty packaging and water purification and filtration segments purchase a portion of their inventories in united states dollars and sell a significant amount of their products in united states dollars and therefore are exposed to realized foreign currency gains and losses upon payment of such payables and the collection of such receivables 
similarly  such united states denominated assets and liabilities must be converted into their functional canadian currency when preparing their financial statements  which results in realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
the increase in the average value of the canadian dollar  as explained above  primarily resulted in gains for such liabilities and losses for such assets 
since our canadian subsidiaries had more assets than liabilities denominated in united states dollars  the increase in the average value of the canadian dollar had an adverse affect on their results of operations in fiscal ii the results of operations of our canadian subsidiaries are translated from their functional canadian currency to united states dollars for purposes of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the average value of the canadian dollar  as explained above  had an overall positive impact upon our results of operations due to translating the results of operations in fiscal at a higher average currency exchange rate as compared with the average currency exchange rate used to translate the results of operations in fiscal during fiscal  such strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar had an overall positive impact upon our results of operations including the discontinued operations 
with respect to our continuing operations  there was an overall adverse impact 
during fiscal compared with fiscal  the value of the euro decreased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations for the following reasons i our netherlands subsidiary which is reported in our dialysis and endoscope reprocessing segments maintains a portion of its cash in united states dollars  sells some of its products in united states dollars and pays various liabilities in united states dollars 
therefore  it is exposed to realized foreign currency gains and losses upon activity in such dollar cash accounts  collection of such receivables and payment of such liabilities 
similarly  such united states denominated assets and liabilities must be converted into their functional euro currency when preparing their financial statements  which results in realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
the decrease in the average value of the euro  as explained above  primarily resulted in losses for such liabilities and gains for such assets 
since our netherlands subsidiary had more assets than liabilities denominated in united states dollars  the decrease in the average value of the euro had an overall positive affect on our results of operations in fiscal ii the results of operations of our netherlands subsidiary are translated from its functional euro currency to united states dollars for the purpose of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in the average value of the euro  as explained above  had an overall positive impact upon our results of operations due to translating the fiscal results of operations which had an overall loss at a lower average currency exchange rate as compared with the average currency exchange rate used to translate the fiscal results of operations which also had an overall loss 
during fiscal  such weakening of the euro relative to the united states dollar had an overall positive impact upon our results of operations 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such dollar denominated net assets into functional currency  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
due to the insignificant net amount of assets and liabilities of our netherlands subsidiary denominated in united states dollars at september   we did not have any foreign currency forward contracts on that date 
under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting most of the impact of the weakening of the euro on our results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all of our foreign currency forward contracts were designated as hedges 
gains and losses related to the hedging contracts to buy euros forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet at july  compared with july   the value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately and the value of the euro increased by approximately compared with the value of the united states dollar 
the total of these currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of  during fiscal after adjusting for the realization of the cumulative translation adjustment related to our discontinued operations  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal compared with fiscal did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of our balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
inflation during fiscal we experienced higher materials  labor  and distribution costs compared with fiscal  which cost increases were in excess of the general rate of inflation 
we implemented price increases for certain of our products which partially offset these cost increases  however  our pre existing businesses primarily the dialysis and water purification and filtration segments were unable to obtain higher selling prices as more fully described in results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
although carsen was reported as discontinued operations in fiscal  the endoscopy and surgical  scientific and related portion of the endoscope reprocessing operating segments adhered to our critical accounting policies described below 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales excluding certain sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  therapeutic  specialty packaging and a portion of endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when our distribution fleet is utilized except for one large customer in dialysis whereby all products are shipped fob destination 
with respect to endoscopy and surgical  water purification and filtration  scientific products and dental products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to some of our water purification and filtration equipment and an insignificant amount of our sales of dialysis equipment and scientific products  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of endoscopy and surgical  water purification and filtration and scientific product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
with respect to a portion of endoscopy and surgical sales all of which is part of the discontinued operations  we enter into arrangements whereby revenue is immediately recognized upon the transfer of equipment to customers who pay on a cost per procedure basis  subject to minimum monthly payments 
such arrangements are non cancelable by the customer and provide for a bargain purchase option by the customer at the conclusion of the term 
all direct costs related to these transactions are recorded at the time of revenue recognition 
some of such transactions also provide for future servicing of the equipment  which service revenue component is deferred and recognized over the period that such services are provided 
with respect to these multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to the equipment and service components based upon vendor specific objective evidence which principally includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and service sold as stand alone components 
sales of a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment to a third party distributor in the united states are recognized on a bill and hold basis 
such sales satisfy each of the following criteria i the risks of ownership have passed to the third party distributor  ii the third party distributor must provide a written purchase order committing to the purchase of specified units  iii the bill and hold arrangement was specifically requested by the third party distributor for the purpose of minimizing the impact of multiple shipments of the units  iv the third party distributor provides specific instructions for shipment to customers  and completed units held by us for the third party distributor generally do not exceed three months of anticipated shipments  v we have no further performance obligations with respect to such units  vi completed units are invoiced to the third party distributor with day payment terms and such receivables are generally satisfied within such terms  and vii completed units are ready for shipment and segregated in a designated section of our warehouse reserved only for the third party distributor 
due to the termination of the minntech olympus distribution agreement on august   future sales will no longer be made on a bill and hold basis 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of our sales  including the bill and hold sales arrangement  contain right of return provisions  and customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our sales of dialysis and dental products and certain prepaid packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and dental customers  volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided  such volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the volume rebates for fiscal is approximately  in volume rebates as a result of the addition of dental products  offset by cancellation during the three months ended october  of a volume rebate program resulting from consolidation in the dialysis industry 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume and trade ins for the entire rebate agreement periods 
trade in allowances were not significant during fiscal if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the volume rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of therapeutic filtration products  endoscope reprocessing products and services  and dental products are sold to third party distributors  the majority of endoscopy and surgical products and services are sold directly to hospitals  the majority of water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  scientific products and services are sold to hospitals  laboratories and other end users  and specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
due to the direct distribution of our endoscope reprocessing products in the united states commencing in fiscal  the majority of our endoscope reprocessing products and services will be sold directly to hospitals and other end users 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  brand names  technology  non compete agreements and patents  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is primarily responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in performing a review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in performing our annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management compares the current fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results which management believes to be reasonable 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
with few exceptions  our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimate 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty  although a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states may carry a warranty period of up to fifteen months 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
stock based compensation on august   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method for the transition 
under the modified prospective method  stock compensation expense will be recognized for any option grant or stock award granted on or after august   as well as the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to august   based upon the award s fair value 
for fiscal and earlier periods  we have accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under which stock compensation expense is not recognized because we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
most of our stock options are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the option award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for options subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of options issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value  and estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the option grant which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities we recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as costs to terminate a contract  the exit or disposal of a business  or the early termination of a leased property  by recognizing the liability at fair value when incurred  except for certain one time termination benefits  such as severance costs  for which the period of recognition begins when a severance plan is communicated to employees 
inherent in the calculation of liabilities relating to exit and disposal activities are significant management judgments and estimates  including estimates of termination costs  employee attrition  and the interest rate used to discount certain expected net cash payments 
such judgments and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis 
the cumulative effect of a change to a liability resulting from a revision to either timing or the amount of estimated cash flows is recognized by us as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
although we have historically recorded minimal charges associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded approximately  of severance costs in income from discontinued operations in fiscal related to the sale of substantially all of carsen s assets 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
we record legal fees and other expenses related to litigation as incurred 
additionally  we assess  in consultation with our counsel  the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
amounts are accrued when we  in consultation with counsel  determine that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
such a review considers known future changes in various effective tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the united states effective tax rate were to change in the future  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
it is our policy to establish reserves for exposures as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
we establish the reserves based primarily upon management s assessment of exposure associated with acquired companies and permanent tax differences 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically at least annually and adjustments are made  as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves 
the majority of our income tax reserves originated from acquisitions 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities principally include certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts recorded 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products are imported from the far east and western europe 
all of our operating segments sell a portion of their products outside of the united states and our netherlands subsidiary sells a portion of its products outside of the european union 
consequently  our business could be materially affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting the united states  canada and the netherlands 
a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an overall positive impact in fiscal compared with fiscal including our discontinued operations  and in fiscal compared with fiscal  upon our results of operations and stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
with respect to our continuing operations  there was an overall adverse impact for the above periods 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis and endoscope reprocessing segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
additionally  financial statements of the netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the euro and the united states dollar had an overall positive impact for fiscal compared with fiscal  and an overall adverse effect in fiscal compared with fiscal  upon our results of operations as described in our md a  and had a positive impact upon stockholders equity 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedge instruments 
due to the insignificant net amount of assets and liabilities of our netherlands subsidiary denominated in united states dollars at july   we were not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts 
however  under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting most of the impact of the weakening of the euro on our results of operations 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal and did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
interest rate market risk we have a united states credit facility for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
therefore  interest expense is principally affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our united states credit facilities  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facilities consist of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally for libor contracts 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
such outstanding debt under our united states credit facilities was  and  at july  and  respectively  and the average outstanding balance during fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
presently  we do not utilize any interest rate derivatives 
our other long term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates 
we also maintained a significant cash balance of  at july  which is invested in low risk cash equivalents at prevailing market rates of interest 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income for us which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar and the euro as these currencies relate to the united states dollar 
in order to minimize the potential adverse impact of unfavorable movements in foreign currencies  we typically utilize foreign currency forward contracts 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary have net assets in currencies principally united states dollars other than their functional canadian and euro currency which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary is exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar or euro appreciates relative to the united states dollar 
however  an insignificant amount of such net assets existed at july  and therefore a increase in the canadian dollar or euro relative to the united states dollar would result in an insignificant realized loss 
accordingly  we did not utilize foreign currency forward contracts at july  additionally  since our foreign subsidiaries limit the use of foreign currency forward contracts to the hedging of actual net assets  a loss in fair value for such instruments generally would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of the underlying net assets 
in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements adverse changes would be caused by depreciation of either the canadian dollar or the euro relative to the united states dollar assuming that such operations are profitable 
for fiscal and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries 
furthermore  a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in an unrealized loss of  and  at july  and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such a loss to be realized in the near term
