background and overview we incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in august in  we completed an initial public offering and invested  in otisville biotech  inc  which also completed an initial public offering later that year 
in  charles e 
harris purchased a controlling interest in us and became the control person in otisville 
we then divested our other assets and became a financial services company  with the investment in otisville as the initial focus of our business activity 
we hired new management for otisville  and otisville acquired new technology targeting the development of a human blood substitute 
by  we operated two insurance brokerages and a trust company as wholly owned subsidiaries 
in  otisville changed its name to alliance pharmaceutical corporation  and by  we had completed selling our  investment in alliance for total proceeds of  in  we sold our insurance brokerage and trust company subsidiaries to their respective managements and registered as an investment company under the act  commencing operations as a closed end  non diversified investment company 
in  we elected to become a business development company subject to the provisions of sections through of the act 
throughout our corporate history  we have made early stage venture capital investments in a variety of industries 
we define venture capital investments as investments in start up firms and small businesses with exceptional growth potential 
in  we made our first tiny technology investment 
from august through december   all of our initial investments have been exclusively in tiny technology 
since our investment in otisville in through december   we have made a total of venture capital investments  including four private placement investments in securities of publicly traded companies 
we have sold of these investments  realizing total proceeds of  on our invested capital of  eighteen of these investments were profitable 
as measured from first dollar in to last dollar out  the average and median holding periods for these investments were years and years  respectively 
as measured by the separate rounds of investment within these investments  the average and median holding periods for the separate rounds of investment were years and years  respectively 
at december   we valued the venture capital investments remaining in our portfolio at  or percent of our net assets  including net unrealized depreciation of  at december   from first dollar in  the average and median holding periods for these venture capital investments were years and years  respectively 
as measured by the separate rounds of investment within these investments  the average and median holding periods for the separate rounds of investment were years and years  respectively 
we have invested a substantial portion of our assets in venture capital investments of private  development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth  have little or no history of operations and are developing unproven technologies 
at december    or percent  of our net assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments  net of unrealized depreciation of  at december    or percent  of our net assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments  net of unrealized depreciation of  at december    or percent  of our net assets at fair value consisted of private venture capital investments  net of unrealized depreciation of  we value our private venture capital investments each quarter as determined in good faith by our valuation committee  a committee of independent directors  within guidelines established by our board of directors in accordance with the act 
see footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in consolidated financial statements 
we have discretion in the investment of our capital 
however  we invest primarily in illiquid equity securities of private companies 
generally  these investments take the form of preferred stock  are subject to restrictions on resale and have no established trading market 
our principal objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation 
therefore  a significant portion of our investment portfolio provides little or no income in the form of dividends or interest 
we earn interest income from fixed income securities  including us government and government agency securities 
the amount of interest income we earn varies with the average balance of our fixed income portfolio and the average yield on this portfolio 
interest income is secondary to capital gains and losses in our results of operations 
we present the financial results of our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance during any period is the net increase decrease in our net assets resulting from our operating activities  which is the sum of the following three elements net operating income loss the difference between our income from interest  dividends  and fees and our operating expenses 
net realized income loss on investments the difference between the net proceeds of sales of portfolio securities and their stated cost  plus income from interests in limited liability companies 
net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments the net unrealized change in the value of our investment portfolio 
owing to the structure and objectives of our business  we generally expect to experience net operating losses and seek to generate increases in our net assets from operations through the long term appreciation of our venture capital investments 
we have relied  and continue to rely  on proceeds from sales of investments  rather than on investment income  to defray a significant portion of our operating expenses 
because such sales are unpredictable  we attempt to maintain adequate working capital to provide for fiscal periods when there are no such sales 
results of operations years ended december    and during the three years ended december    and  we had net increases decreases in net assets resulting from operations of   and  respectively 
investment income and expenses during the three years ended december    and  we had net operating losses of   and  respectively 
the variation in these results is primarily owing to the changes in investment income and operating expenses 
during the three years ended december   and  total investment income was   and  respectively 
during the three years ended december    and  operating expenses were   and  respectively 
during  investment income increased owing to an increase in our income on us government and government agency securities  as our holdings increased from  at december  to  at december  and as a result of an increase in interest rates during the year 
during  investment income increased by  primarily owing to an increase in our holdings in us government and government agency securities from  at december  to  at december  the increase in operating expenses during was primarily owing to increases in the profit sharing provision  salaries and benefits  professional fees administration and operations  rent expense and directors fees and expenses 
profit sharing expense for was  an increase of  as compared to profit sharing expense increased primarily as a result of the gains realized on the sale of neurometrix  inc  offset by the taxes payable by the company on the deemed dividend and taxes payable on built in gains 
the profit sharing expense is also impacted by the company s decision to retain its net realized long term capital gains for reinvestment for growth  rather than distribute them as a cash dividend 
when the company chooses to retain its net realized long term capital gains  it declares a deemed dividend and pays taxes on behalf of shareholders 
conversely  when the company distributes its net realized long term capital gains as a cash dividend  the shareholders pay all of the taxes 
the taxes payable by the company on behalf of shareholders reduce the amount of profit against which the profit sharing payable to employees is calculated 
had the company chosen to distribute its net realized long term capital gains as a cash dividend  the provision for employee profit sharing would have been  for  rather than the actual provision for employee profit sharing of  for salaries and benefits increased by  or percent  primarily as a result of the addition of three employees 
professional fees increased by  or percent  reflecting in part the expenses associated with ongoing compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of administration and operations increased by  or percent  primarily as the result of increases in travel expenses associated with additional investments in portfolio companies  increases in expenses related to the preparation and distribution of the annual and quarterly reports and proxy statement owing to the increased number of shareholders  and an increase in the premium expense for director and officer liability insurance 
the premium expense for director and officer liability insurance increased by  to  in  and the premium expense for is estimated to be  rent expense increased by  or percent due to the leasing of additional office space in california and new york 
directors fees and expenses increased by  or percent as a result of an increase in the fees paid to the directors for monthly retainer and meeting attendance in the increase in operating expenses during was primarily owing to increases in the profit sharing provision  salaries and benefits  professional fees and administration and operations 
the profit sharing provision increased by  or percent 
the increase in the profit sharing provision is primarily a result of the increase in the value of our investment in neurometrix  inc  which completed its ipo on july  salaries and benefits increased by  or percent  primarily as a result of the addition of four employees  partially offset by a decrease in mandatory retirement plan pension expense that is being amortized through december  administration and operations increased by  or percent  primarily as the result of an increase in travel expenses associated with additional investments in portfolio companies  an increase in expenses related to the preparation and distribution of the annual and quarterly reports and proxy statement owing to the increased number of shareholders  and an increase in expense and the amount of director and officer liability insurance 
the premium expense for director and officer liability insurance increased by  to  in professional fees increased by  or percent  reflecting in part the expenses associated with implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of and rule a under the act 
we estimated that our total incremental direct and indirect expenses in associated with the sarbanes oxley act of and rule a under the act totaled  realized income and losses from investments during the years ended december   and  we had net realized income losses from investments of   and  respectively 
the variation in these results is primarily owing to variations in gross realized income loss from investments and income taxes in each of the three years 
for the years ended december    and  realized income loss from investments  before taxes  was   and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit for the years ended december   and was   and  during  our realized income from investments before taxes of  consisted primarily of a realized gain of  from the sale of our investment in neurometrix  inc  offset by realized losses of    and  from the sale of our shares in agile materials technologies  inc  experion systems  inc  nanotechnologies  inc  and optiva  inc  respectively

the increase in our secondary source of liquidity from december   to december   is owing to the completion of the public offering of neurometrix  inc critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the footnote to the consolidated schedule of investments 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be critical valuation of portfolio investments as a business development company  we invest primarily in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of private companies 
the investments are generally subject to restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
we value substantially all of our equity investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our valuation committee on a quarterly basis 
the valuation committee  comprised of three or more non interested board members  reviews and approves the valuation of our investments within the valuation procedures established by the board of directors 
fair value is generally defined as the amount that an investment could be sold for in an orderly disposition over a reasonable time 
generally  to increase objectivity in valuing our assets  external measures of value  such as public markets or third party transactions  are utilized whenever possible 
valuation is not based on long term work out value  nor immediate liquidation value  nor incremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated 
this difference could be material 
pension and post retirement benefit plan assumptions the company provides a retirement healthcare benefit plan for employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability values related to our post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about the discount rate  the rate of increase in healthcare costs  and mortality  among others 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the post retirement benefit liabilities could be effectively settled considering the timing of expected payments for plan participants 
in estimating this rate  we consider rates of return on high quality fixed income investments included in published bond indexes 
we consider the moody s aa corporate bond index and the citigroup pension liability index in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions 
the weighted average rate we utilized to measure our post retirement benefit obligation as of december  and calculate our expense was  which is a decrease from used in determining the expense 
recent developments portfolio companies on january   we made a  follow on investment in privately held nanogram corporation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of market risk to be valuation risk and the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates 
we consider the management of risk to be essential to our business 
value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see the valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in item consolidated financial statements 
neither our investments nor an investment in us is intended to constitute a balanced investment program 
we have invested a substantial portion of our assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be based on new technology and to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth and have not attained profitability or have no history of operations 
because of the speculative nature and the lack of a public market for these investments  there is significantly greater risk of loss than is the case with traditional investment securities 
we expect that some of our venture capital investments will be a complete loss or will be unprofitable and that some will appear to be likely to become successful but never realize their potential 
even when our private equity investments complete initial public offerings ipos  we are normally subject to lock up agreements for a period of time  and thereafter  the market for the unseasoned publicly traded securities may be relatively illiquid 
because there is typically no public market for the equity interests of many of the small privately held companies in which we invest  the valuation of the equity interests in that portion of our portfolio is determined in good faith by our board of directors in accordance with our valuation procedures 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the determined value of our portfolio of equity interests may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity interests existed 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments 
we also invest in short term money market instruments  and both short and long term us government and agency obligations 
to the extent that we invest in short and long term us government and agency obligations  changes in interest rates may result in changes in the value of these obligations which would result in an increase or decrease of our net asset value 
the level of interest rate risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements  and it will vary from period to period 
if the average interest rate on u 
s 
government and agency obligations at december   were to increase by  and basis points  the value of the securities  and our net asset value of the same types and time to maturity  would decrease by approximately   and  respectively 
in addition  we may from time to time opt to borrow money to make investments in the future 
our net investment income will be dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest such funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in the event we choose to borrow funds for investing purposes
