table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent highlights revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income of billion 
the following recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry during fiscal worldwide wireless subscribers grew by more than to reach approximately billion 
cdma subscribers  including both g cdmaone and g cdma x  xev do and wcdma  grew to of total worldwide wireless subscribers to date 
g subscribers all cdma based grew to approximately million worldwide through september  including approximately million cdma x subscribers  approximately million wcdma subscribers and approximately million xev do subscribers 
cdma based handset shipments totaled approximately million units  an increase of over the million units shipped in fiscal cdma based handset shipments grew faster than total worldwide handsets and represent an estimated of the total million worldwide handset shipments  compared to of the total million shipments in fiscal average selling prices of cdma based handsets were approximately  same as the prior year 
we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma based phones and data modules all of which were g  including cdma x  xev do and wcdma  an increase of  compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in the prior fiscal year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we estimate the ratio of wcdma reported royalties to total reported royalties was  up from reported in the year ago quarter 
we estimate that  in western europe  wcdma handset sales represented approximately of all manufacturer handset sales during the period from april through june  up from in the year ago quarter 
according to wireless intelligence  an independent source of wireless operator data 
unit shipments and average selling prices are for the period from july through june based on reports provided during the fiscal year by our licensees manufacturers 
based on reports by strategy analytics  a global research and consulting firm in their global handset market share updates 
based on estimates derived from our licensee reports and estimates from the yankee group  a global market intelligence and advisory firm in the technology and telecommunications industry 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture  have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our cdma technology and other technologies 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property  from services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments 
these segments are qualcomm cdma technologies  or qct  qualcomm technology licensing  or qtl  qualcomm wireless internet  or qwi  and qualcomm strategic initiatives  or qsi 
qct is a leading developer and supplier of cdma based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications  multimedia functions and global positioning system products 
qct s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices  particularly mobile phones  data cards and infrastructure equipment 
the integrated circuits for wireless phones include the mobile station modem msm  radio frequency rf and power management pm devices 
these integrated circuits for wireless phones and system software perform voice and data communication  multimedia and global positioning functions  radio conversion between rf and baseband signals and power management 
the infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband cdma modem functionality in the wireless operator s equipment providing wireless standards compliant processing of voice and data signals to and from wireless phones 
qct s system software enables the other phone components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling phone manufacturers to develop handsets utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits 
in addition to the key components in a wireless system  qct provides system reference designs and development tools to assist in customizing wireless phones and user interfaces  to integrate our products with components developed by others  and to test interoperability with existing and planned networks 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct utilizes a fabless production business model  which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made 
integrated circuits are die  cut from silicon wafers  that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes 
die  cut from silicon wafers  are the essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost 
we rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly  and most of the testing  of our integrated circuits 
our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits 
the majority of our integrated circuits are purchased on a turnkey basis  in which our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits 
we also employ a two stage manufacturing business model in which we purchase completed die directly from semiconductor manufacturing foundries  and directly manage and contract with third party manufacturers for back end assembly and test services 
we refer to this two stage manufacturing business model as integrated fabless manufacturing ifm 
ibm  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  ltd 
and united microelectronics are the primary foundry suppliers for our family of baseband integrated circuits 
atmel  freescale formerly motorola semiconductor and ibm are the primary foundry suppliers for our family of analog  radio frequency and power management integrated circuits 
our fabless model provides us the flexibility to select suppliers that offer advanced process technologies to manufacture  assemble and test our integrated circuits at a competitive price 
qtl grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd and or ofdma standards and their derivatives 
qtl receives revenue from license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property 
license fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments 
ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products  net of certain permissible deductions eg certain shipping costs  packing costs  vat  etc qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the vast majority of such revenues has been generated primarily through our licensees sales of cdmaone  cdma and wcdma products 
qwi  which includes qualcomm wireless business solutions qwbs  qualcomm internet services qis and qualcomm government technologies qgov  generates revenues primarily through mobile communication products and services  software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qwbs provides satellite and terrestrial based two way data messaging  position reporting and wireless application services to transportation companies  private fleets  construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies 
qis provides brew based binary runtime environment for wireless products that include user interface and content delivery and management products and services for the wireless industry 
qis also provides qchat and qpoint products and services 
qchat enables virtually instantaneous push to talk functionality on cdma based wireless devices while qpoint enables operators to offer e and location based applications and 
table of contents services 
the qgov division provides development  hardware and analytical expertise to united states government agencies involving wireless communications technologies 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi manages the company s strategic investment activities  including mediaflo usa  inc mediaflo usa  the company s wholly owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary 
qsi also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma based products and services 
our strategy is to invest in cdma based operators  licensed device manufacturers and start up companies that we believe open new markets for cdma technology  support the design and introduction of new cdma based products or possess unique capabilities or technology 
our mediaflo usa subsidiary expects to offer a nationwide multicasting network based on our mediaflo mds and flo technology 
this network is expected to be utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the united states 
the commercial availability of the mediaflo usa network and service will be determined by our wireless operator partners 
mediaflo usa s network will use the mhz spectrum for which we hold licenses for a nationwide footprint 
additionally  mediaflo usa plans to procure  aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers whether they operate on cdma or gsm wcdma networks in the united states 
distribution  marketing  billing and customer relationships are expected to remain services provided by our wireless operator partners 
as part of our strategic investment activities  we may consider various corporate structuring and exit strategies at some point in the future  which may include distribution of our ownership interest in mediaflo usa to our stockholders in a spin off transaction 
nonreportable segments include the qualcomm wireless systems division  which sells products that operate on the globalstar low earth orbit satellite based telecommunications system and provides related services  the qualcomm mems technologies division  which is developing an imod display technology based on micro electro mechanical system mems structure combined with thin film optics  the qualcomm flarion technologies division  which is developing ofdm ofdma technologies  and other product initiatives 
looking forward the deployment of g networks cdma and wcdma enables higher voice capacity and data rates  thereby supporting more minutes of use and data intensive applications like multimedia 
as a result  we expect continued growth in demand for g products and services around the world the deployment of cdma networks is expected to continue 
o more than operators have launched cdma x  o more than operators have deployed the higher data speeds of xev do and several are preparing to deploy ev do revision a 
gsm operators are expected to continue transitioning to wcdma networks 
o more than gsm operators have migrated their networks to wcdma  o more than operators have launched commercial hsdpa networks and manufacturers are beginning to trial the faster uplink speeds of hsupa 
we expect wcdma phone prices to segment into high and low end  with low end prices decreasing significantly as volumes increase and competition intensifies among wcdma phone manufacturers and integrated circuit suppliers  as happened with cdma we expect phone market share will change and competition will increase as wcdma networks grow and expand beyond japan and western europe into the united states and china 
to meet growing demand for advanced g phones and increased multimedia msm functionality  we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward the development of multimedia products  software and services for the wireless industry 
however  we expect that a portion of our research and development initiatives in fiscal will not reach commercialization until several years in the future 

table of contents we expect demand for low end phones to continue  and we have invested resources to develop single chip products  which integrate the baseband  radio frequency and power management chips into one package  lowering component counts and enabling faster time to market 
while we are moving aggressively to address the low end market more effectively with cdma based products  we still face significant competition from gsm based products at the very low end  particularly in brazil and india 
we will continue to invest in the evolution of cdma and a broad range of other technologies as part of our vision to enable a range of technologies  each optimized for specific services  including the following products and technologies o the brew applications platform  content delivery services and user interfaces  o the mediaflo media distribution system mds and flo technology for delivery of multimedia content  o the do multicarrier multilink extensions dmmx and hsdpa multicarrier multilink extensions hmmx platforms to support the long term roadmaps of xev do and hsdpa  o ofdm and ofdma based technologies  o our imod display technology 
we will continue to devote resources to working with and educating all participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market 
however  we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay fair royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new  highly cost effective competitors to their products 
we expect that such companies will continue their attacks on our business model in various forums throughout the world 
in addition  our license agreement with nokia corp 
expires in part on april  if we cannot conclude an extension or a new license agreement beyond that time period  nokia s rights to sell subscriber products under most of our patents will expire  as will our rights to sell integrated circuits under nokia s patents 
while we continue to work with nokia to see if we can reach an agreement  there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully resolve this matter before april   and little progress has been made to date 
if we are unable to reach agreement  we will aggressively pursue all our legal and business remedies and assume that nokia will do likewise 
nokia has stated publicly that it does not intend to pay us for its use of our patents prior to the resolution of the dispute 
as a result  under generally accepted accounting principles  we will be unable to record royalty revenue attributable to nokia s sales until a court awards damages or agreement is reached  potentially resulting in a negative impact on future royalty revenues reported by our qtl segment 
according to public reports made available at www 
cdg

as reported by the global mobile suppliers association  an international organization of wcdma and gsm global system for mobile communications suppliers in their september and october reports 
further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the risk factors included in this annual report 
revenue concentrations revenues from customers in south korea  japan  china and the united states comprised   and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues in fiscal as compared to   and  respectively  in fiscal  and   and  respectively  in fiscal we distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location 
revenues from customers in china increased as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal and in fiscal  as compared to the prior years  primarily due to the maturing of cdma based manufacturers in china that are experiencing wider adoption of their products in international markets for low priced cdma phones and wcdma phones 
combined revenues from customers in south korea  japan and the united states decreased as a percentage of total revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal  primarily due to increases in the percentage of revenues from wcdma manufacturers in western europe and increased activity by manufacturers in china 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  share based payments  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that 
table of contents differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property  from messaging and other services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
we record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs  including special pricing agreements and other volume related rebate programs 
such reductions to revenue are estimates  which are based on a number of factors  including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of our customer agreements 
we license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd and or the ofdma standards and their derivatives 
licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee  typically five to seven years 
we earn royalties on such licensed cdma products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter  and  in some instances  although royalties are reported quarterly  payment is on a semi annual basis 
during the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal  we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees the estimated licensees in the quarter in which such sales occurred  but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made 
not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  due to escalating and changing business trends  we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the estimated licensees 
these escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of wcdma networks  changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition  and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees 
starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter 
the change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of september   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were billion and million  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  volumes  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we hold minority investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
these investments  which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss  totaled billion at september  we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination 
table of contents that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in other than temporary losses on our minority investments in publicly traded companies 
we hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine 
these investments totaled million at september  we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the investee s liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate  and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
from time to time  we may consider third party evaluations  valuation reports or advice from investment banks 
we also consider new products services that the investee may have forthcoming  any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee s competitors and or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in other than temporary losses on our investments in private companies 
such losses were not significant in fiscal share based payments 
we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas r  share based payment 
effective september   we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of fas r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for estimating the value of share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of fas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date  which are subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
share based compensation expense recognized under fas r for fiscal was million 
at september   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was billion  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
net stock options  after forfeitures and cancellations  granted during fiscal represented of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period 
total stock options granted during fiscal represented of outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period 
upon adoption of fas r  we began estimating the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial option pricing model binomial model 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the value of all share based awards was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under fas the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under fas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation awards 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with fas r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial statements  but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
for this reason  and because we do not view share based compensation as related to our operational performance  we exclude estimated share based compensation expense when evaluating the business performance of our operating segments 
the guidance in fas r and sab is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for share based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
market based methods are emerging that  if employed by us  may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses 
the uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal using the binomial model  we used the implied volatility of market traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model  consistent with the guidance in fas r and sab we utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two years  and the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity was used for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years 
the weighted average volatility assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
the volatility percentage assumed for fiscal was based on the implied volatility of traded options  as compared to the blend of implied and historical volatility data used in prior years 
fas r includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered in estimating expected volatility 
we believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield curve of us treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant 
the weighted average risk free interest rate 
table of contents assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
we do not target a specific dividend yield for our dividend payments  but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the dividend yield assumption was for fiscal  which if decreased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
dividends and or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to board approval as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance  stock repurchase programs  mergers and acquisitions  and other sources and uses of cash 
while our historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future  it may be subject to substantial change  and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to investors 
the post vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information 
the weighted average post vesting forfeiture rate assumption was for fiscal  which if decreased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
the suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information 
the weighted average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
income taxes 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
as part of our assessment of potential adjustments to our tax returns  we increase our current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
as of september   gross deferred tax assets were million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   we had gross deferred tax assets of million related to capital loss carryforwards 
we can only use capital losses to offset capital gains 
based upon our assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies  we expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize 
significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains and the timing of realization of capital losses 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are reflected in the period the change is made 
we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative amount of which is approximately billion as of september  should we repatriate foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made 

table of contents beginning september   we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from september  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position  we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with our legal proceedings based on our belief that a liability  while possible  is not probable 
further  any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
acquisitions on january   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of flarion technologies  inc flarion  a privately held developer of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access ofdma technology for approximately million in consideration  consisting of approximately million in shares of qualcomm stock  million in cash  and the exchange of flarion s existing vested options and warrants with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately million 
in addition  we assumed flarion s existing unvested options with an estimated aggregate fair value of million  which is recorded as share based compensation over the requisite service period pursuant to fas r 
upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones during the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred additional aggregate consideration of million  consisting of approximately million in cash of which million will be payable in july  million in shares of qualcomm stock of which million is issuable in march  and the modification of flarion s existing vested options and warrants with an estimated incremental fair value of approximately million 
the additional amounts payable in cash and shares on the milestone date were treated as additional consideration and recorded as goodwill 
in addition  the modification of flarion s existing unvested options resulted in an estimated incremental fair value of million  which will be recorded as share based compensation over the requisite service period pursuant to fas r 
the acquisition of flarion is intended to broaden our ability to effectively support operators who may prefer an ofdma or a hybrid ofdm cdma wcdma network alternative 
the addition of flarion s intellectual property and engineering resources also supplements the resources that we have already dedicated over the years towards the development of ofdm ofdma technologies 
strategic investments in our qsi segment our qsi segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services 
qsi segment assets totaled million at september   compared to million at september  our mediaflo usa subsidiary  a wireless multimedia operator  is expected to begin commercial operations in qsi s assets related to mediaflo usa totaled million and million at september  and september   respectively 
we also enter into strategic relationships with cdma wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry 
due to financial and competitive challenges facing wireless operators  we cannot assure you that our investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of cdma technologies 
cdma wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have limited operating histories  are faced with significant capital requirements and are highly leveraged and or have limited financial resources 
if these cdma wireless operators are not successful  we may have to write down our investments in or loans to these operators 
our qsi segment maintains strategic investments in marketable equity securities classified as available for sale 
we strategically invest in companies in the high technology industry and typically do not attempt to reduce or 
table of contents eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments 
the fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market price volatility 
our strategic investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility 
downward fluctuations and market trends could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the realizable value of these securities and derivative instruments is subject to market and other conditions 
qsi also makes strategic investments in privately held companies  including early stage companies and venture funds 
these investments are comprised of equity investments  recorded at cost or under the equity method  and warrants that are recorded at fair value or at cost 
the recorded values of these investments may be written down due to changes in the companies conditions or prospects 
these strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize 
as a result  we could lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies  which could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 
most of these strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment  if at all 
to the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives  we may sell the investments and recognize the realized gain loss in investment income expense 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary  we will record a charge to investment income expense 
in some cases  we make strategic investments that require us to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early stage companies 
the consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments 
key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal included our ongoing investment in our mediaflo usa subsidiary  a slow down in the rate of strategic investment  including our investment in inquam  and realized gains on certain strategic investments

revenues from amortized license fees were million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties 
during the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal  we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees the estimated licensees in the quarter in which such sales occurred  but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made 
not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  due to escalating and changing business trends  we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the estimated licensees 
these escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of wcdma networks  changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition  and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees 
starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter 
the change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal accordingly  we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in fiscal qwi segment

accounts receivable increased by during fiscal days sales outstanding  on a consolidated basis  were days at september   compared to days at september  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the timing of cash receipts for royalty receivables

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and non investment grade fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed income investments could lose value 
if the general economy were to weaken significantly  the credit profile of issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios could deteriorate  and our investments could lose value 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our interest bearing securities  the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates dollars in millions no single fair thereafter maturity total value fixed interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate floating interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate equity price risk 
we invest in a number of diversified marketable securities and mutual fund shares subject to equity price risk 
the recorded values of marketable equity securities increased to billion at september  from billion at september  the recorded value of equity mutual fund shares increased to billion at september  from million at september  our diversified investments in companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in the concentrations of these investments may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at september  would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or million 
our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods 
accordingly  we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material 
additionally  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures 
the recorded values of these strategic investments totaled million at september   compared to million at september  in connection with our stock repurchase program  we sell put options that may require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices 
these written put options subject us to equity price risk 
at september   we had two outstanding put options  enabling holders to purchase  shares of our common stock upon exercise for approximately million net of the option premiums received 
the put option liabilities  with a fair value of million at september   were included in other current liabilities 
if the fair value of our common stock at september  decreased by  the amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares by million  net of the million in premiums received 
additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report 
foreign exchange risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts 
such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
at september   the net recorded value of our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of cdma and wcdma products was a liability of million 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates 
table of contents were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would incur a loss of approximately million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
