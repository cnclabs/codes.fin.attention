risk factors risks related to the company in addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses  important factors that are specific to our industry and company could materially impact our future performance and results 
the factors described below are the most significant risks that could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us  that we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general may also impair our business and operations 
should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
while some of our facilities do not compete directly with other racetracks or otbs for live  on track patron attendance due to geographic separation of facilities or differences in seasonal timing of meetings  other of our facilities compete with other racetracks and off track wagering facilities  some of which offer alternative forms of gaming  such as slot machines  that provide these facilities with the advantage of additional entertainment options 
for example  hoosier park s market experienced an increase in competition when indiana downs  another racetrack  opened near hoosier park  and indiana downs otbs in evansville and clarksville  indiana have had a negative impact on patron attendance at ellis park and churchill downs and their simulcast operations  respectively 
in florida  calder race course may face competition directly from other miami based racetracks in the future 
there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at north american racetracks due to a number of factors  including increased competition discussed above  unwillingness of customers to travel a significant distance to racetracks and the increasing availability of off track wagering 
declining attendance at live horse racing events has prompted racetracks to rely increasingly on revenues from inter track  off track and account wagering markets 
the industry wide focus on inter track  off track and account wagering markets has increased competition among racetracks for outlets to simulcast their live races 
a continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on track wagering  as well as increased competition in the inter track  off track and account wagering markets  has lead to a decrease in the amount wagered at our facilities and on races conducted at our racetracks and may materially  adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operation and prospects 

return to index an apparent decline in the popularity of horse racing  as evidenced by decreased industry handle generated during  could adversely impact our business 
the continued popularity of horse racing is important to our growth plans and our operating results 
our business plan anticipates attracting new customers to our racetracks and otbs and off track betting facilities 
even if we are successful in making acquisitions and expanding and improving our current operations  we may not be able to attract a sufficient number of new customers to achieve our business plan 
public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change 
any decline in the interest in horse racing or any change may adversely impact our revenues and  therefore  our results of operations 
declining on track attendance and increasing competition in simulcasting may have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
we also compete for patrons with other sports  entertainment and gaming operations  including land based  riverboat  cruise ship and native american casinos and state lotteries 
while we currently receive revenues from wagering activity on our racing content over certain third party account wagering sites  we face competition from gaming companies that operate on line and internet based gaming services 
these services allow patrons to wager on a wide variety of sporting events from home 
unlike most on line and internet based gaming companies  our business requires significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both its continued operation and expansion 
we also could face significantly greater costs in operating our business compared to these gaming companies 
we cannot offer the same number of gaming options as on line and internet based gaming companies 
in addition  many on line and internet gaming companies are based off shore and avoid regulation under us state and federal laws 
these companies may divert wagering dollars from legitimate wagering venues such as our racetracks 
competition in the gaming industry is likely to increase due to limited opportunities for growth in new markets 
our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material  adverse affect on our business 
we face extensive regulation from various authorities the operation of pari mutuel wagering and gaming facilities is subject to extensive state and local regulation 
we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate 
our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities  including the khra  the ihrc  the florida dpw  the lsrc  the louisiana board and the irb 
in louisiana  our gaming operations must meet the licensing requirements of the louisiana gaming control board 
as part of this regulatory framework  licenses to conduct live horse racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are granted annually  and gaming licenses in louisiana are granted every five years 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks and gaming facilities 
however  we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses 
in louisiana  gaming licenses are contingent upon maintaining the racing license  and we must conduct live race days within a week period in order to maintain the racing license 
in indiana  we must conduct live race days in order to conduct simulcasting 
the loss of or material change in our licenses  registrations  permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct and could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
the high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy 
potential changes in legislation and regulation of our operations our gaming operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business 
certain aspects of our gaming operations are also subject to federal statutes or regulations 
all of our pari mutuel wagering operations are contingent upon continued governmental approval of those operations as forms of legalized gaming 
legislation to limit or prohibit gaming pari mutuel or non pari mutuel may be introduced in the future 
any restriction on or prohibition of gaming operations could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  any expansion of our gaming operations into alternative gaming  such as slot machines  video lottery terminals and other forms of non pari mutuel gaming  will likely require various additional licenses  registrations  permits and approvals 
the approval process can be time consuming and costly  and there is no assurance of success 
we have and continue to seek legal authority to offer alternative gaming at our racetracks where alternative gaming is not currently permitted 

return to index the indiana horse racing industry currently receives a subsidy from riverboat casinos 
currently the subsidy is distributed as follows for purse expenses  for breed development and for the two existing racetrack operators  which is divided equally 
during march of  the ihrc approved integrity  a program designed to improve the integrity of horse racing in indiana that is effective april  the estimated cost of complying with the rules and regulations created by integrity will be financed by the two existing racetrack operators in indiana using the subsidy paid by riverboat casinos  which is estimated to be of the total subsidy 
as a result  beginning april   the subsidy will be distributed as follows for purse expenses  for breed development and for the two existing racetrack operators  which is divided equally 
any change in this arrangement could adversely impact our operations in indiana and the value of this operation 
in illinois  the irb has the authority to designate racetracks as host track for the purpose of receiving host track revenues generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races 
racetracks that are designated as host track obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the state of illinois 
under illinois law  the host track is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari mutuel wagering 
failure to designate arlington park as host track during this period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  arlington park is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenues monies that are otherwise payable to arlington park s purse account 
the right to recapture these revenues is subject to change every legislative session 
these statutory or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session 
the reduction or elimination of any one of them could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  certain revenue sources are dedicated by legislation or regulation and may be subject to change 
the passage of legislation permitting alternative gaming at racetracks can be a long and uncertain process 
as a result  there can be no assurance that jurisdictions in which we own or operate racetracks will pass legislation permitting alternative gaming  if jurisdictions pass such legislation  it will be permitted at our racetracks  and if alternative gaming is permitted at our racetracks  it will be on economically viable terms 
if alternative gaming legislation is enacted in any jurisdiction where we own or operate a racetrack and we proceed to conduct alternative gaming  there may be significant costs and other resources to be expended and there will be significant risks involved  including the risk of changes in the enabling legislation  that may have a material  adverse impact on that racetrack s results of operations 
we may not be able to attract quality horses and trainers to provide high quality horse racing  we must attract the country s top horses and trainers 
our success in attracting the top horses and trainers largely depends on the overall horse population available for racing and our ability to offer and fund competitive purses 
various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country  including competition from racetracks in other areas and mare reproductive loss syndrome mrls which caused a large number of mares in kentucky to sustain late term abortions or early embryonic loss in with respect to mrls  the number of foals registered in was the same as the number registered in  indicating a stabilization of the foal crop 
the number of thoroughbreds registered has an impact on the number of horses available to participate in live racing 
the stabilization of bloodstock sales during is primarily attributed to an improving economy  favorable tax law changes for horse purchasers and the strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar which helped drive increased participation by overseas buyers 
we also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenues for race purses and capital improvements 
any decline in the number of suitable race horses could prevent us from attracting top horses and trainers and may require us to reduce the number of live races we present 
a reduction in suitable race horses could force us to increase the size of our purses or other benefits we offer  to conduct fewer races or to accept horses of a lower quality 

return to index we experience significant seasonal fluctuations in operating results we experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors 
we have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks  and the number of live racing days varies from year to year 
the number of live racing days we can offer directly affects our operating results 
a significant decrease in the number of live racing days and or live races could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
our live racing schedule dictates that we earn a substantial portion of our net earnings in the second quarter of each year  when the kentucky derby and the kentucky oaks races are run over the first weekend in may 
business interruption  such as weather conditions  could affect our ability to conduct our material races 
any adverse impact on our races  including the kentucky derby  the kentucky oaks and the key races at our other tracks could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
our business depends on providers of totalisator services in purchasing and selling our pari mutuel wagering products  our customers depend on information provided by united tote company  scientific games racing and amtote international  inc these totalisator companies provide the computer systems that accumulate wagers  record sales  calculate payoffs and display wagering data in a secure manner 
these are the only three major vendors that provide this service in north america 
the loss of any one of these vendors as a provider of this critical service would decrease competition and could result in an increase in the cost to obtain these services 
because of the highly specialized nature of these services  replicating these totalisator services would be expensive 
in addition  we rely upon the totalisator company s computer systems to ensure the integrity of our wagering process 
a perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horse racing 
the failure of totalisator companies to keep their technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively or develop new forms of wagering and or affect the security of the wagering process  thus affecting patron confidence in our product 
we may be held responsible for contamination  even if we did not cause the contamination our business is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
in addition  environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials  even if we did not cause the contamination 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with the applicable environmental laws and have no material cleanup obligations 
however  if we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered  a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions 
inclement weather and other conditions since horse racing is conducted outdoors  unfavorable weather conditions  including extremely high and low temperatures  storms  tornadoes and hurricanes  could cause races to be cancelled and or wagering to suffer 
our operations are subject to reduced patronage  disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to severe weather conditions  natural disasters and other casualties 
during  we sustained disruption to our operations at calder race course in florida  fair grounds race course and our otb locations in louisiana  and ellis park in kentucky due to the damage caused by hurricanes and a tornado 
although we were able to run a shortened fair grounds race meet at another location  this facility remains closed due to the extent of the damage suffered from hurricane katrina 
the timing of the re opening of this facility and three of the otbs in louisiana remains uncertain 
we are also restoring ellis park for operation of its summer meet 
any flood or other severe weather condition that could lead to the loss of use of our other facilities for an extended period could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
we may not be able to complete acquisition or expansion projects on time  on budget or as planned we expect to pursue expansion and acquisition opportunities  and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development  including acquisition of other properties and ways to expand our business operations  which evaluations may include discussions and the review of confidential information after the execution of nondisclosure agreements with potential acquisition candidates and or development partners 

return to index we could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives  identifying potential acquisition candidates and or development partners  negotiating projects on acceptable terms  and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects 
the integration of new operations and any other properties we may acquire or develop will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day to day business 
the process of integrating new properties or projects may also interrupt the activities of those businesses  which could have a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure that any new properties or developments will be completed or integrated successfully 
management of new properties or business operations  especially in new geographic areas  may require that we increase our managerial resources 
we cannot assure that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or developments 
we depend on agreements with our horsemen the us interstate horseracing act of  as well as various state racing laws  require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races  and in some cases conduct live racing 
we also have written agreements with horse owners with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in louisiana 
the failure to maintain agreements with our horsemen and industry associations on satisfactory terms could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
we depend on key personnel we are highly dependant on the services of thomas h 
meeker  our president and chief executive officer  and other members of our senior management team 
we have initiated a formal succession plan to hire the successor to mr 
meeker who plans to retire from the company when his employment contract expires in march of our inability to successfully replace mr 
meeker and hire and retain key personnel could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
we may not be able to adequately insure our properties the significant damage and resulting insurance claims caused by i hurricane katrina to the new orleans  louisiana area and our fair grounds facility and otbs  ii hurricane wilma to south florida and our calder race course facility  and iii a tornado that struck our ellis park facility  will increase the costs of obtaining property coverage for our facilities and significantly impact our ability to obtain and maintain adequate property coverage at our facilities 
our ability to obtain and maintain adequate property coverage at reasonable prices could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
other risks many other risks beyond our control could seriously disrupt our operations  including the effect of global economic conditions  the effect including possible increases in the cost of doing business resulting from future war and terrorist activities or political uncertainties  the economic environment  the impact of interest rate fluctuations  the financial performance of our racing operations  costs associated with our efforts in support of alternative gaming initiatives  costs associated with customer relationship management initiatives  and our accountability for environmental contamination

return to index legislative and regulatory changes federal in  the country of antigua filed a formal complaint against the united states with the world trade organization wto  challenging the united states ability to enforce certain federal gaming laws sections  and of title of the united states code known as the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act  respectively  and collectively the acts against foreign companies that were accepting internet wagers from united states residents 
at issue was whether the united states enforcement of the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act against foreign companies violated the general agreement on trade in services gats 
in november of  a wto panel ruled that the united states  as a signatory of gats  could not enforce the acts against foreign companies that were accepting internet wagers from united states residents 
the united states appealed the ruling and  in april of  the wto s appellate body ruled that the united states had demonstrated that the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act were measures necessary to protect public morals or maintain public order  but that the united states did not enforce the acts consistently between domestic companies and foreign companies as required by gats 
the wto s appellate body specifically referenced the interstate horseracing act  which appeared to authorize domestic companies to accept internet wagers on horse racing  as being inconsistent with the united states stated policy against internet wagering 
in arguments and briefs before the wto s appellate body  the united states argued that the acts  specifically the wire act  applies equally to domestic companies and foreign companies and the interstate horseracing act does not create an exception for domestic companies to accept internet wagering on horseracing 
the wto s appellate body did not rule on whether an exception was created  but recommended that the wto s dispute settlement body request the united states bring measures found to be inconsistent with gats into conformity with its obligations with gats 
the united states has until april  to bring its policies in line with the ruling  assuming it believes any changes are necessary 
the effect of this ruling on the ability of domestic companies to accept internet wagers and other account wagers on horse racing is unclear 
the national thoroughbred racing association  on behalf of its members  including churchill downs incorporated  is currently in discussions with the us trade representative on various alternatives the united states may choose to take both administratively and legislatively in the wake of the appellate ruling

florida on november   amendment  a slot machine question which sought to allow voters in miami dade and broward counties to hold local referenda on the issue  passed by a margin of 
on march   voters in miami dade and broward counties voted in separate local referenda to decide whether slot machines could be installed at the seven existing pari mutuel sites in those counties  including calder 
although the measure passed in broward county  home of gulfstream park  it was unsuccessful in miami dade county  where calder is located 
slot machine gaming was approved by the florida legislature during a special session of the florida legislature on december  slot operations are expected to commence at broward s four pari mutuels in early summer of we believe that the failure of the local referendum to pass in miami dade county was due primarily to governor bush s active opposition to the measure during the final days of the campaign 
we are preparing a strategy to seek passage in miami dade county when the issue can again be placed on the ballot 
the earliest that it can be placed on the ballot is we are currently determining when it can be placed on the ballot 
the impact on our results of operations and financial position of the failed referendum in miami dade county and the operation of slot machines at pari mutuel wagering facilities in broward county is uncertain at this time 

return to index illinois pursuant to the illinois horse racing act  arlington park and all other illinois racetracks is permitted to receive a payment commonly known as purse recapture 
generally  in any year that wagering on illinois horse races at arlington park is less than of wagering both in illinois and at arlington park on illinois horse races in  arlington park is permitted to receive of the difference in wagering in the subsequent year 
the payment is funded from the arlington park purse account 
under the illinois horse racing act  the arlington park purse account is to be repaid via an appropriation by the illinois general assembly from the illinois general revenue fund 
however  this appropriation has not been made since subsequently  illinois horsemen unsuccessfully petitioned the illinois racing board irb to prevent illinois racetracks from receiving this payment in any year that the illinois general assembly did not appropriate the repayment to the racetrack s purse accounts from the general revenue fund 
further  the illinois horsemen filed lawsuits seeking  among other things  to block payment to illinois racetracks  as well as to recover the and amounts already paid to the illinois racetracks 
these lawsuits filed by the illinois horsemen challenging the and reimbursements have been resolved in favor of arlington park and the other illinois racetracks 
several bills were filed in the  and sessions of the illinois legislature that  in part  would eliminate the statutory right of arlington park and the other illinois racetracks to continue to receive this payment 
none of these bills passed 
as the legal right still exists  arlington park has elected to continue to receive the recapture payment from the purse account 
if arlington park loses the statutory right to receive this payment  there would be a material adverse impact on arlington park s results of operations 
arlington park is entitled under law to share in the proceeds of the illinois horse racing equity fund 
the illinois horse racing equity fund is to be funded by the th riverboat license issued in illinois at a rate of of the adjusted gross receipts 
the grant of the th riverboat license is currently the subject of numerous legal challenges and  as such  is currently not an operational riverboat license 
at such time should the th riverboat license in illinois be granted and a riverboat become operational  arlington park would be entitled to receive additional revenue  which could be significant 
as an alternative  a proposal has been made during the spring session of the illinois legislature that would direct of adjusted gross receipts from most riverboat casinos to be placed into the illinois horse racing equity fund 
all illinois racetracks and horsemen groups support the proposal 
the riverboat casinos are lobbying against the proposal during january and february when there is no live racing in illinois  the irb designates a thoroughbred racetrack as the host track in illinois 
the irb appointed arlington park as the host track in illinois during january  which resulted in pari mutuel revenues comparable to the same period in the irb did not appoint arlington park as the host track in illinois for february  which resulted in a decrease of million in pre tax earnings for the month of february of compared to the same period of the irb appointed arlington park the host track in illinois during january for days  which is the same as january in addition  arlington park was appointed the host track for eight days during february of arlington park s future designation as the host track is subject to the annual appointment by the irb 
a change in the number of days that arlington park is designated host track could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
kentucky the kentucky horse industry continues to seek legal authority to offer alternative forms of gaming at kentucky s eight existing racetracks 
alternative forms of gaming would enable our kentucky racetracks to better compete with neighboring gaming venues by providing substantial new revenues for purses and capital improvements 
several alternative gaming bills have been filed in the session of the kentucky general assembly  including two bills filed in the house and in the senate 
the kentucky equine education project keep  an alliance of the commonwealth s equine industry leaders  including our company  supports legislation that calls for a statewide voter referendum in the fall of to amend the state constitution to allow kentucky s eight racetracks to offer full casino gaming 
the commonwealth s share of the new revenue would be earmarked for education  healthcare  local development and environmental concerns benefiting the entire commonwealth under the keep plan 
the senate president has continued to be publicly opposed to alternative gaming 
the governor  on the other hand  states that he would not stop legislation authorizing alternative forms of gaming if it were passed by the house and senate  but he continues to publicly question the economics 
legislation is not expected to successfully pass during the legislative session 

return to index louisiana we have received statutory  regulatory and other authorizations to operate slot machines at fair grounds 
failure to maintain the necessary gaming licenses to own and operate slot machines at fair grounds could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
under the louisiana statute  fair grounds may operate slot machines 
as a result of hurricane katrina  the agreement between harrah s casino in new orleans and the state of louisiana has been amended to eliminate the million gaming revenue threshold before fair grounds may operate slot machines 
fair grounds is currently pursing a conforming statutory amendment 
due to hurricane katrina  we are currently evaluating the feasibility of beginning construction of a new slot facility 
churchill downs louisiana horseracing company  llc has completed the process to seek the necessary local zoning change and permits 
on august   the new orleans city council passed ordinances approving hours of operation for slot machines at fair grounds as part of its conditional use permit 
the ordinances also established additional provisos negotiated by churchill downs louisiana horseracing company  llc and the new orleans city council relating to other conditional use activities 
in april  the new orleans city council instructed the city attorney to file a declaratory judgment action to determine if installation of slot machines at fair grounds would violate the city charter 
the louisiana attorney general has expressed an opinion that the addition of slots at the racetrack would not violate the city charter 
in june  a resident living near fair grounds filed a lawsuit alleging  among other claims  that slot machines at the racetrack would be a violation of the city charter  which limits new orleans to one land based casino 
based upon an opinion from the louisiana attorney general and other legal advice  we do not believe the installation of slot machines at fair grounds violates the city charter 
california in california  hollywood park was part of a coalition of racetracks and card clubs supporting proposal on the november ballot 
the proposal failed to pass by a margin of to 
if passed  this initiative would have directed the governor to renegotiate all existing compacts with native american tribes in california 
if the tribes had declined to renegotiate the existing compacts  then five racetracks  including hollywood park  and card clubs would have been allowed to operate electronic gaming devices 
we continue to work with other members of the california horse industry on a long term strategy for developing a legislative agenda that addresses the competitive advantages afforded to native american casinos due to the fact that we entered into a reinvestment agreement related to the hollywood park racetrack business in accordance with the sale of the assets of hollywood park as more fully described above under recent developments 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole  and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those initial estimates 
in general  however  our estimates have historically approximated actual results 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of plant and equipment  receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability and workers compensation claims 
additionally  estimates are used for determining income tax liabilities  the valuation of interest rate risk derivative contracts interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments 

return to index we evaluate our goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets in accordance with the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for goodwill and intangible assets  we review the carrying values at least annually during the first quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we assign estimated useful lives to our intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory  competition and other economic factors 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  amortization expense could increase significantly 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes and by alternative gaming competition 
a significant negative impact from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our plant and equipment and or our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes is included in items f and g  respectively  in this annual report on form k 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a fixed asset impairment charge of million and an intangible asset impairment charge of million at our ellis park facility 
the asset impairment charges were triggered as a result of ellis park s poor live race meet performance during the third quarter of our review  based on consideration of current fiscal year operating results and the forecasted operating results of the facility  indicated that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying value of long lived assets 
accordingly  we adjusted the carrying value of these long lived assets  including grandstands and buildings  furniture and fixtures  equipment  improvements and goodwill  to management s estimated fair value 
we anticipate that the current carrying value of ellis park will be supported by ongoing operations  however  should plans for expected operating results at ellis park not be realized  an additional write down of these assets could occur 
in connection with losses incurred from natural disasters  insurance proceeds are collected on existing business interruption and property and casualty insurance policies

 accounting for involuntary conversions of nonmonetary assets to monetary assets 
we also use estimates and judgments for financial reporting to determine our current tax liability  as well as those taxes deferred until future periods 
net deferred and accrued income taxes represent significant assets and liabilities of the company 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
adjustments to deferred taxes are determined based upon changes in differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by future tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates or the estimated level of taxable income or non deductible expenses could change the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and affect the overall effective tax rate and tax provision 

return to index historically  we have utilized interest rate swap contracts to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt and have designated such swaps as cash flow hedges of anticipated interest payments 
our interest rate swap contracts matched the critical terms of the underlying debt  thus qualifying for hedge accounting 
such critical terms include the notional amounts  benchmark interest rate basis  interest reset dates and payment dates 
the fair market value of the swaps was recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of income taxes

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable that we have deemed to have a high risk of collectibility 
we analyze historical collection trends and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates could impact our bad debt expense and results of operations 
for our business insurance renewals over the past several years  we assumed more risk than in the prior years  primarily through higher retentions and higher maximum losses for stop loss insurance for certain coverages 
in  our business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverages and retentions as in previous years 
we estimate insurance liabilities for workers compensation and general liability losses based on our historical loss experience  certain actuarial assumptions of loss development factors and current industry trends 
any changes in our assumptions  actuarial assumptions or loss experience could impact our total insurance cost and overall results of operations 
our ability to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs in future years under terms and conditions comparable to the current years is uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  consolidated net revenues our net revenues and earnings are significantly influenced by our racing calendar
