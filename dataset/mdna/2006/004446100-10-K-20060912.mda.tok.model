item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary we are reporting a increase in operating profit to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year 
this increase in operating profit was achieved  despite a highly competitive environment  primarily through maintaining our profit margin and our successful management of selling  general and administrative costs  which decreased  in fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  from fiscal this decline in net sales also negatively impacted our gross profit  which decreased  to  for fiscal our net income decreased to  or per diluted share  a decrease of compared to fiscal year our financial position as of june   remains strong  as we had cash and short term investments of  working capital of  no long term debt and shareholders equity of  our business is separated into three principal segments health sciences  chemicals colorants and agrochemicals 
the health sciences segment is our largest segment both in sales and gross profits 
this segment is comprised of apis  pharmaceutical intermediates  diagnostic chemicals  biopharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements 
we typically partner with both customers and suppliers years in advance of a drug coming off patent to provide the generic equivalent 
we have a pipeline of new and second source generic products poised to reach commercial levels over the coming years as the patents on existing drugs expire  both in the united states and europe 
in addition  as new members join the european union  primarily from eastern europe  they become subject to the same regulatory standards as their western european counterparts 
given our regulatory expertise  we believe that this represents an opportunity for us  and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of that opportunity 
the chemicals colorants segment supplies chemicals used in the color producing industries such as the textiles  ink  paper and coatings industries  as well as chemicals used in plastic  resins  adhesives  coatings  food  flavor additives  and the production of agrochemicals 
our customers for these products are predominantly located in the united states  and we purchase the products primarily from manufacturers located in china and western europe 
the agrochemicals segment  while relatively small in terms of sales  is our most profitable in terms of gross margin percentages 
this segment sells herbicides  pesticides  and other agricultural chemicals to customers primarily located in the united states and western europe 
our joint venture with nufarm  which markets butoxone r  is expected to increase our market share of the peanut  soybean and alfalfa herbicide markets 
we formerly also reported under the institutional sanitary supplies segment  which included cleaning solutions  fragrances and deodorants for commercial and industrial customers 
this former segment was successfully divested from our ongoing business during fiscal our main strengths are sourcing  regulatory support and quality control 
we are currently the largest buyer of pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals for export from china  purchasing from over different factories 
in this section  we explain our general financial condition and results of operations  including the following o factors that affect our business o our earnings and costs in the periods presented o changes in earnings and costs between periods o sources of earnings o the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition as you read this section  refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for the three years ended june  we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  environmental and other contingencies  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on various factors  including historical experience  advice from outside subject matter experts  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affected our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of any product when it is shipped and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we have no acceptance or other post shipment obligations and we do not offer product warranties or services to our customers 
sales are recorded net of returns of damaged goods from customers  which historically have been immaterial  and sales incentives offered to customers 
sales incentives consist primarily of volume incentive rebates 
we record volume incentive rebates as the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer in earning the rebate are recorded  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from customers being unable to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and the industries in which those customers operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their ability to make payments being impaired  additional allowances would be required 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
we write down our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete goods by an amount equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  we may overestimate or underestimate the demand for our products which would result in our understating or overstating  respectively  the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of customer relationships  trademarks  epa registration  patent license and covenants not to compete 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  we use many assumptions and estimates that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
additionally  we use as necessary  an outside valuation firm to help us evaluate recorded goodwill 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
environmental and other contingencies we establish accrued liabilities for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual  or our share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period that the determination was made 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we had current net deferred tax assets of  and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on our projecting that we will have sufficient future earnings to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize a deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net income at that time 
deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since substantially all of these earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
a deferred tax liability will be recognized when we expect that we will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
determination of the amount of the unrecognized us income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
in addition  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce a portion of such us tax liability 
stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model  including an estimate of forfeitures 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option term assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on the historical daily price changes of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
for stock option grants issued during fiscal  we used an expected stock price volatility of based upon the historical volatility at the time of issuance 
with regard to the weighted average option term assumption  for stock option grants issued during fiscal  we used an expected option term assumption of years as determined under the simplified method prescribed in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no

net sales net sales decreased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales decreases in our health sciences and agrochemicals segments  which were partially offset by a sales increase in our chemicals colorants segment 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment decreased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a decrease over net sales of  for the prior year 
the sales decrease from the prior period is directly attributable to the loss of foreign business of  from two previously launched apis due to increased competition 
the fiscal results  net of the two lost apis  include a sales reduction of  from our foreign operations which was partially offset by a sales increase of  from our domestic operations over the prior fiscal year 
chemicals colorants net sales for the chemicals colorants segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
this increase of  or  over the prior period is primarily attributable to an increase in the agricultural intermediate  food  beverage and cosmetics and coatings product groups of  as compared to fiscal our chemical business is diverse in terms of products  customers and consuming markets 
one customer within our color pigment and pigment intermediate business purchased  less product during fiscal as their contract had expired 
this reduction was more than offset by an increase over the prior period in domestic sales of our diverse chemical and colorants offerings 
in addition  net sales includes a  increase relating to our former cdc business  primarily from sales of the anti clog product we retained 
agrochemicals net sales for the agrochemicals segment decreased to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
this decline over the prior year was primarily due to dry weather conditions shortening the agricultural selling season  for our second largest product 
gross profit gross profit by segment before unallocated cost of sales primarily storage and certain freight costs decreased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june   was or lower than the prior year 
this decrease in gross profit was directly attributable to the loss of business on two larger previously launched apis in asia of  due to significant competitive pressures as well as a decrease in our foreign business  net of the two apis  of this lost gross profit was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from sales increases from our domestic business of  over the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to a gross margin of for the prior fiscal year due primarily to a shift in the product mix of net sales to higher margin products during the fiscal year 
chemicals colorants gross profit for the year ended june   decreased by  or  over the prior year 
gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal decreases in categories such as organic chemicals and chemical intermediates in terms of both volume and margins were the primary reasons for these decreases 
in addition  the decrease in gross margin percentage was partly attributable to an increased allocation of certain freight and storage costs 
agrochemicals gross profit for the agrochemicals segment decreased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  a decrease of  or 
gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary cause of the decrease was lower royalty payments from our foreign customers of and lower gross margins on our second highest volume product compared to the prior fiscal year of the gross profits and margins were also negatively affected by higher costs associated with maintaining our epa registered products and increased rebate expenses of unallocated freight and storage costs unallocated cost of sales decreased  to  in fiscal  compared to  in the prior year  representing a decrease 
the lower costs were mainly a result of decreased sales and shipments to customers 
in addition  certain system improvements allow previously unallocated costs to be identifiable and included in a particular segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a remained stable at for fiscal versus for fiscal the decrease in sg a was primarily due to a  decrease in expenses for our former cdc business  reduced legal fees of  a reduction in audit and sarbanes oxley compliance costs of and reduced sales and marketing related expenses of these expense reductions were partially offset by a charge for a settlement of legal claims against one of our subsidiaries 
operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  an increase of or 
this increase was due to the  decrease in sg a expenses  which was partially offset by the overall decrease in gross profit of  interest and other income expense interest and other income was  for fiscal  which represents a increase from  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of in interest income  a government subsidy paid annually for doing business in a free trade zone in shanghai  china of  proceeds from credit insurance of and the sale of distribution rights for a particular product in certain european countries of  partially offset by a net loss on foreign currency of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal included the recognition of certain deferred tax assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which previously were fully offset by a valuation allowance in the amount of  excluding the recognition of the deferred tax assets  the effective tax rate for fiscal would have been 
the increase in the effective tax rate relates primarily to increased earnings in foreign tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates  primarily germany 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of operations for one of the subsidiaries forming part of the institutional sanitary supplies segment have been recorded as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the net loss from discontinued operations was  and for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively

net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales increases in our three largest segments  as explained below 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year 
several factors contributed to the net increase in net sales in the health sciences segment 
the pharma waldhof business  which we acquired on december   contributed  towards the sales increase 
domestic sales of health science products increased  during fiscal year as compared to the prior year  partly due to sales of pharmaceutical intermediates increasing by  or compared to the prior year 
the large increase in sales of pharmaceutical intermediates reflects the change in attitude by some of the larger pharmaceutical companies towards securing a second  lower cost supplier in asia 
we believe that sales of this product line will continue to increase 
the european and asian market excluding pharma waldhof recorded a net decrease in sales of  as compared to the prior year 
contributing to the net decline in asian sales was the  decrease in sales of two previously launched apis due to increased competition 
this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in sales of two relatively new products over last year 
chemicals colorants net sales for the chemicals colorants segment was  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
this increase of  or  over the prior year is partially attributable to a steady increase in the number of products being offered by our foreign subsidiaries 
sales of chemicals colorants products by our foreign subsidiaries for the year ended june   showed an increase of  over the prior year 
our chemical business is diverse in terms of products  customers and consuming markets 
one customer within our color pigment and pigment intermediate business purchased  less product during fiscal year this reduction was more than offset by a  increase over the prior year in domestic sales of our industrial chemical offerings  in particular products with increased sales were polymer additives  agricultural intermediates  and coatings 
agrochemicals net sales for the agrochemical segment increased to  for the year ended june   an increase of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
the increase in net sales was attributable to higher sales of our two highest volume products 
gross profit gross profit by segment before unallocated cost of sales primarily storage and certain freight costs increased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june   was or lower than the prior year 
the gross margin decreased to compared to a gross margin of for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributed to the lower than normal api gross margin of realized on a relaunched antibiotic and a shift in product mix to pharmaceutical intermediates  which generally have lower margins than apis 
additionally  two of our larger previously launched apis in europe and asia have experienced significant pricing pressures  which further affected our gross profit and gross margin 
we expect pricing pressures on previously launched apis to continue in the short term 
chemicals colorants gross profit for the year ended june   increased by  or  over the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal year included a favorable adjustment of due to the reversal of an accrual for the estimated loss of a purchase contract 
excluding this adjustment  gross profit would have increased by  or 
excluding the adjustment  the segment would have shown improved margins of versus for the prior year 
contributions from categories such as polymer additives  agricultural intermediates and coatings  in addition to improved sales volume and margins in the european markets  were the primary reasons for this improvement 
the increase in gross margin percentage was caused by a decrease in sales to one major customer whose sales had generated lower margins than usual  along with an improvement in margins across other categories due to changes in product mix and  in some cases  improved product pricing 
agrochemicals gross profit for the agrochemicals segment increased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from a large increase in sales of our two highest volume products  improved royalty income of one existing product  and a price increase in another product 
unallocated cost of sales increased  to  in fiscal  compared to  in the prior year  representing a increase 
the higher costs were mainly a result of higher freight costs due to rising fuel surcharges and increased sales and shipments to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of  of expenses of pharma waldhof  which was acquired in december  additional increases in costs of for new business development initiatives including new personnel  an asset impairment charge of relating to our institutional sanitary supplies segment  additional legal fees in our agricultural business of  increased fees associated with the planning and pre implementation efforts of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system of  an increase in fees relating to our audit services and compliance with our obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and increased compensation and related fringe benefit costs of  operating income in fiscal year operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due to the  increase in sg a expenses  which was partially offset by the overall increase in gross profit of interest and other income expense interest and other income of  for fiscal year represents a slight decrease from  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in miscellaneous income of  which was partially offset by a decrease of for minority interest and an increase in the government subsidy we receive for doing business in a free trade zone in shanghai  china in the amount of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal year decreased to from for fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to recognition of certain deferred tax assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which previously were fully offset by a valuation allowance in the amount of  partially offset by increased earnings in foreign tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates  primarily germany 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of operations for one of the subsidiaries forming part of the institutional sanitary supplies segment have been recorded as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the net loss from discontinued operations was  and for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the net loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended includes a non cash write down of goodwill  net of an income tax benefit  of liquidity and capital resources cash flows at june   we had  in cash   in short term investments and no outstanding bank loans 
working capital was  at june   versus  at june  our cash position at june   increased  from the amount at june  operating activities provided cash of  primarily from net income of  and a decrease in inventory of  investing activities provided cash of  primarily as a result of proceeds from the sale of investments of  this was partially offset by of expenditures for property and equipment 
we expect capital expenditures will be between  and  during fiscal financing activities used cash of  primarily as a result of payments of cash dividends of  and payments for purchases of treasury stock of credit facilities we have available credit facilities with certain foreign financial institutions 
these facilities provide us with a line of credit of  which was not utilized as of june  we are not subject to any financial covenants under these arrangements 
we have a revolving credit agreement with a financial institution that expires june   and provides for available credit of  at june   we had utilized  in letters of credit  leaving  of this facility unused 
under the credit agreement  we may obtain credit through direct borrowings and letters of credit 
our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by of the capital of certain of our non domestic subsidiaries 
there is no borrowing base on the credit agreement 
interest under the credit agreement is at libor plus 
the credit agreement contains several covenants requiring  among other things  minimum levels of debt service and tangible net worth 
we are also subject to certain restrictive debt covenants  including covenants governing liens  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on cash dividends  guarantees  sale of assets  sales of receivables  and loans and investments 
we were in compliance with all covenants at june  working capital outlook working capital was  at june   versus  at june  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to net income during the year 
we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of or investments in businesses that are complementary to our own  and such transactions may require the use of cash 
we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  borrowing capacity and access to the equity capital markets  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating expenditures and the anticipated continuation of semi annual cash dividends for the next twelve months 
we may obtain additional credit facilities to enhance our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments and contingencies we have no material financial commitments other than those under operating lease agreements  letters of credit and unconditional purchase obligations 
we have certain contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments that will affect our short and long term liquidity 
at june   we had no significant obligations for capital expenditures 
at june   contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments were as follows payments due and or amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years operating leases     commercial letters of credit standby letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations   total     other significant commitments and contingencies include the following one of our subsidiaries markets certain agricultural chemicals which are subject to the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
fifra requires that test data be provided to the environmental protection agency epa to register  obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products 
the epa requires that follow on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the fifra regulations 
follow on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data 
however  when fifra requirements mandate that new test data be generated to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product  often both the initial and follow on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort 
we are presently a member of two such task force groups and historically  our payments have been in the range of per year 
we may be required to make additional payments in the future 
we  together with our subsidiaries  are subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business 
we do not know how the final resolution of these matters will affect our results of operations in a particular reporting period 
our management is of the opinion  however  that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or liquidity 
in march  our subsidiary  arsynco  received notice from the environmental protection agency epa of its status as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla for a site described as the berry s creek study area 
arsynco is one of over prp s which have potential liability for the required investigation and remediation of the site 
the estimate of the potential liability is not quantifiable for a number of reasons  including the difficulty in determining the extent of contamination and the length of time remediation may require 
in addition  any estimate of liability must also consider the number of other prp s and their financial strength 
since an amount of the liability can not be reasonably estimated at this time  no accrual is recorded for these potential future costs 
the impact of the resolution of this matter on the company s results of operations in a particular reporting period is not known 
however  management believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
related party transactions certain of our directors are affiliated with law firms that serve as our legal counsel on various corporate matters 
during fiscal years  and  we incurred legal fees of  and  respectively  for services rendered to the company by those law firms 
we believe that the fees charged by those firms were at rates comparable to rates obtainable from other firms for similar services 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no

does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the date of sfas no 
we do not believe that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation are required to be reported separately as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the company will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal management is currently evaluating the requirements of fin no 
and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in investment market prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
investment market price risk we had short term investments of  at june  those short term investments consisted of government and agency securities  corporate bonds and corporate equity securities  and they were recorded at fair value and had exposure to price risk 
if this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges  the effect of that risk would be as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we hedge some of our transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding that had a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june   was not material 
in addition  we enter into cross currency interest rate swaps to reduce foreign currency exposure on inter company transactions 
in june we entered into a one year cross currency interest rate swap transaction  which expired in june when the underlying inter company loan was repaid  and in may we entered into a five year cross currency interest rate swap transaction  both for the purpose of hedging fixed interest rate  foreign currency denominated cash flows under inter company loans 
under the terms of these derivative financial instruments  us dollar fixed principal and interest payments to be received under inter company loans will be swapped for euro denominated fixed principal and interest payments 
the change in fair value of the swaps from date of purchase to june   was 
the gains or losses on the inter company loans due to changes in foreign currency rates will be offset by the gains or losses on the swap in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
since our interest rate swaps qualify as hedging activities  the change in their fair value  amounting to and in fiscal and  respectively  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  with the most significant being the euro and the chinese renminbi 
the potential loss as of june   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect our results of operations
