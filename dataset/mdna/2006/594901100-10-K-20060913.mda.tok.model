item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional geographic data 
our significant international business and presence expose us to certain risks  such as currency  interest rate and political risks 
with respect to currency risk  we transact business in different currencies primarily through our foreign subsidiaries 
the fluctuation of currencies impacts sales and profitability 
frequently  sales and the costs associated with those sales are not denominated in the same currency 
we transacted business in approximately twenty eight currencies in fiscal year compared to twenty seven currencies in fiscal year and twenty three currencies in fiscal year the relative currency mix over the past three fiscal years was as follows of reported revenues fiscal year ended june exchange rates as of june  revenues by currency united states dollar european euro british pound sterling australian dollar japanese yen mexican peso all other currencies  total calculated using weighted average exchange rates for the year 
the of reported revenue for all other currencies is calculated based on the weighted average twelve month exchange rates for all other currencies 
the exchange rates as of june for all other currencies represents the weighted average june exchange rates for all other currencies based on the month revenue 
we have evaluated the impact of a change  both upward and downward  of the euro in relation to the us dollar 
a increase in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar would  in fiscal year  have increased annual revenues by approximately million or  while a decline in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar would  in fiscal year  have reduced annual revenues by approximately million or 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact of exchange rate changes on either cost of sales  operating expenses  or income taxes and accordingly  is not necessarily an indicator of the impact of potential exchange rate changes on net income 
additionally  we would be subject to interest rate fluctuations in foreign countries if and to the extent that we elect to borrow in the local foreign currency 
while we have not to date invested in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations  we will continue to evaluate the need to do so in the future 
finally  we are subject to  among others  those environmental and geopolitical risks  and those economic 
pricing and financial risks delineated in item a  titled risk factors 
patents and trademarks we hold four patents through our jtech subsidiary  and are currently applying for patents on certain technologies developed in our operations 
in general  we believe that  historically  our competitive position has not been materially dependent upon patent protection 
the technology used in the design and manufacture of most of our hardware products is largely licensed or purchased from third parties 
with respect to our software products  we have historically relied on nondisclosure agreements and applicable us and foreign copyright and trademark laws for protection 
in the us and in most other countries  we believe that both statutory and common law have provided and will continue to provide us with sufficient protection 
there are risks that third party entities  including competitors  could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property 
given these potential risks  we have implemented procedures to monitor misappropriation of its intellectual property 
if a misappropriation is detected  the company will pursue appropriate legal action

this annual report on form k also contains trademarks  trade names and servicemarks of other companies that are the property of their respective owners 
fluctuations and customers our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future depending upon various factors  including the timing of new product introductions  changes in our pricing and promotion policies and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
political uncertainty and world turmoil  created by unpredictable factors  eg  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  and the volatile and unpredictable political climate in the middle east  will continue to adversely impact travel and tourism and therefore our quarterly operating results 
moreover  we have experienced increased seasonality of our business  given the significant volume of international sales 
in particular  with the european summer holidays  we generally experience lower sales volume in the first fiscal quarter relative to other quarters 
we also experience a stronger than average sales volume for the retail products and services in the second fiscal quarter due to the holiday season 
additionally  with the relative slowdown in corporate buying at the beginning of the calendar year  which is our third fiscal quarter  seasonal weakness for the third quarter ending march has been experienced 
therefore  we believe that sequential quarter to quarter historic comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
no single customer accounts for or more of our consolidated revenues  nor is any material portion of our business subject to renegotiation of profits at the election of the us federal government 
during the three years ended june   and  we have been a party  directly and indirectly  to certain contracts with the us federal government  which contracts contained standard termination for convenience clauses 
in the fiscal years  and  our us government related revenue was approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated revenue 
we do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact if the us government elected to exercise its rights under a termination for convenience clause 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and do not anticipate that environmental compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations 
backlog we generally have a backlog of approximately two months revenue  substantially all of which is cancelable at any time before shipment 
as of june   and  the backlog totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  only an immaterial portion of the backlog existing as of the first day of the fiscal year is not recognized in that fiscal year

item a 
risk factors there are a multitude of risks to which we are subject 
these risks fall roughly into one of different categories  as follows environmental and geopolitical risks 
our business is very sensitive to the threat of terrorism and political uncertainty 
as the hospitality and tourism industries we serve are highly sensitive to consumer sentiments caused by world events  we are very vulnerable to down turns in customer buying habits associated with the ever present threat of terrorist attacks and the uncertain political climates  such as in the middle east and parts of asia 
our business is very sensitive to environmental and health disasters 
actual or anticipated environmental disasters and epidemics  including for example  hurricanes  tsunamis  spreading viruses and flues  will deter and delay our customers from buying our products  as concerns about potential or anticipated instances of environmental or health disasters tend to suppress travel and tourism 
environmental disasters can also directly adversely affect our operations in the affected areas  for example  hurricane wilma caused some temporary disruption to jtech whose main office is in boca raton  florida  our regional sales and service office in deerfield beach  florida  and our hotel software development office in naples  florida 
higher oil and gas prices worldwide have a material adverse impact on the travel and tourism industries 
consumers reduce discretionary spending  such as on travel and dining  when there is a material increase in non discretionary expenses caused by a rise in oil and gas prices 
we maintain offices in certain parts of the world that are subject to economic instability  political unrest and terrorism  such as argentina  brazil and israel 
the performance of our offices in these areas will be adversely impacted if these regions become subject to economic declines  political strife or episodes of terrorism 
economic  pricing and financial risks 
because almost half of our sales are outside of the us  our results could be significantly affected by economic conditions in countries and regions in which we conduct business 
in short  we are subject to the variability of world economies since almost half of our business is conducted in foreign countries 
while this can have a moderating impact as one region s improving conditions can offset another region s declining conditions  this nonetheless adds another layer of uncertainty in the planning and forecasting process 
our quarterly financial results are dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders and the shipment of products for large orders 
large software orders from customers may account for more than an insignificant portion of earnings in any quarter 
we expect the list of customers with whom we do the largest amount of business to vary from year to year as a result of the timing of the rollout of each customer s system 
further  if a customer delays or accelerates its delivery requirements  or if a product s completion is delayed or accelerated  revenues that we may have expected in a given quarter could be deferred or accelerated into subsequent or earlier quarters  respectively 
our ability to establish pricing is subject to rapidly changing market and competitive conditions 
to be competitive and to avoid losing business on the basis of price  we must evaluate our pricing routinely 
there are instances where we may have to reduce our pricing to win business 
these market forces have and will continue to place pressure on our gross margins and overall profitability 
our gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter based upon product mix 
for example  as we enjoy a higher gross margin on software than on hardware  our gross margin will vary depending upon the percentage of software and the percentage of hardware sold each quarter 
given the fact that the actual product mix is difficult to predict each quarter with accuracy  there is uncertainty and variability as to the projected gross margin on a quarter to quarter basis 
our non major account business is difficult to predict 
our major account customers generally those customers who operate or more locations have longer sales cycles and deployments  our non major account sales have much shorter sales cycles and shorter deployments 
as a significant portion of our business is non major account business  there is inherent difficulty in accurately predicting buying patterns and  accordingly  such is much harder to forecast  and appropriately staff and prepare for fluctuations in buying demand 
some of the advanced systems we sell are very complex and require a high level of technical sophistication 
the costs of the implementation and operation of an effective service structure capable of servicing increasingly complex software systems in more remote locations is high and may require us to engage contractors who generally have a higher cost structure than employees 
the additional costs are also driven by the complexity of open systems  which generally incorporate third party software products the support and service of which may be more difficult and costly  difficulty in implementing  operating  and maintaining and supporting centrally hosted systems  such as central reservation systems  and centrally hosted property management systems and reporting systems 
we are subject to certain material cost increases out of our control 
while we attempt to control third party costs  we exercise little or no control over certain material expenses  such as health care costs which are experienced based  compliance with new legislation  and rising oil and gas prices 
we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies and exchange rates 
as we conduct significant portions of our business in foreign currencies  we experience both sequential and year to year deviations 
for example  as much of our european business is transacted in euros  our revenue on a consolidated basis will decline if the euro weakens relative to the us dollar and increase if the euro strengthens relative to the us dollar 
as a publicly traded company  our stock price is subject to certain market gyrations that are out of our control and that have nothing to do with our actual operating performance 
accordingly  we can experience short term surges and declines in our stock price merely as a result of economic news or events not related directly to our operating performance 
technology risks 
with the increasing complexity of products and the increasingly sophisticated requirements of our customers  we may encounter difficulties or delays in the development  production  testing  and marketing of our products 
examples of such could include our inability to deliver new products and services in a timely manner  or delays in releasing new updates to existing products 
additionally  the development of software is an inherently difficult process that may result in software bugs that adversely impact a customer s business 
while we have a testing and beta program and protocol that we implement prior to the general release of any product  such processes cannot guarantee that the released software will not have any bugs 
the manufacturing of our hardware platform is performed primarily by a company in singapore 
while we have a very good relationship with such company  and while we have not experienced any material manufacturing problems with such company  there are no guarantees that this company will not experience labor or manufacturing challenges in the future 
additionally  our manufacturer procures many of its components from other third parties who could experience manufacturing or labor issues 
large customized deployments may be difficult and may result in cost overruns that are not recoverable 
specifically  we have certain contracts under which we are required to provide certain systems and services at a fixed price 
we may be contractually required to absorb additional costs which may not be recoverable if we underestimate the amount of work required or if we encounter unanticipated technical issues 
this is always a risk given the complexity of some of the systems we install and the ever increasing size and scope of some of the deployments 
ever shifting changes in technology may result in our investing in certain technologies that become obsolete  or may result in our delaying investing in technologies to our detriment 
as we invest significantly in research and development  there is an ever present risk that we will pursue technology that we ultimately determine is not marketable or does not achieve the desired solution 
in such an event  we may be required to write off our investment which would have an adverse impact on our operating income 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities 
as our software processes and sometimes stores sensitive data  it may be possible for such data to be compromised if the customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures 
in instances where there is a security breach there may be potential liability 
while we believe that all of our current software is secure  and while we believe we have taken appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach  there nonetheless are no guarantees that all systems are completely invulnerable attack which could result in liability 
resource and personnel risks 
some of our vendors have unionized workers who could strike to our detriment 
as some of our vendors have employees who are protected by certain labor laws or who may be members of unions  we are subject to the labor issues such vendors confront 
accordingly  we could experience unanticipated manufacturing or supply shortages if any of our key vendors are impacted by labor difficulties or work slow downs or stoppages 
our inability to hire or our delay in hiring qualified resources could adversely impact our ability to satisfy customers needs and our ability to maintain appropriate internal controls 
finding qualified technical resources where our research and development facilities are located is an ongoing challenge as the us labor markets remain historically tight 
if we cannot find such technical resources  we risk delays in satisfying customer demands  or may even lose the opportunity to provide software to the customer 
if we are required to retain a consultant  the costs of providing development would increase 
further  any delays we may experience in recruiting and retaining qualified accounting and auditing staff could result in additional third party accounting and auditing costs and expenses  in particular those in connection with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
legal and accounting risks 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through a combination of trade secrets  copyright  trademark law  nondisclosure agreements  and technical measures  these protections will not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in short  there are few guarantees that we can effectively preserve the uniqueness and proprietary nature of our products  as others could attempt to copy what we have developed  either through legal or illegal means 
as a company that does business with many customers  employees and vendors throughout the world  we are subject to legal and administrative claims  cases  proceedings  settlements  and investigations  including claims made by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses 
while we continue to police these matters  and take steps to reduce the likelihood that these matters will arise  litigation is very commonplace and largely unavoidable given the great access court systems worldwide provide 
each year we incur many costs associated with changes in  laws  regulations  directives  and other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations 
this is especially true for us since we have a presence in so may countries throughout the world 
we from time to time receive unsolicited letters from entities which suggest or assert that we may be infringing a patent 
in those instances  we will assess the validity of the claims and the purported patent  and determine whether a license is appropriate or necessary 
if we conclude that a license is not necessary  there is a risk that we will be sued 
currently  there is no such pending legal action 
additionally  we face the risk of indirect liability as a result of infringement claims brought against our customers 
while we have no reason to believe that any of our products and services infringe any patents  there can be no guarantees that we will not become involved in infringement matters  and we could as a result incur both legal expenses and damages 
credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing effort to battle identity theft and credit card fraud 
we continue to work with credit card issuers to assure that our products and services comply with these rules 
there can be no assurances  however  that our products and services are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking 
additionally  there can be no guarantee that our customers will implement all of the credit card security features that we introduce  or all of the protections and procedures required by the credit card issuers  or that our customers will establish and maintain appropriate levels of firewall protection and other security measures 
when there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss  there is the potential that parties could seek damages from us 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
we are subject to income and sales taxes in the united states and all of the other countries in which we conduct business 
additionally  we may be subject to the certain tariffs imposed by the world trade organization and other governing bodies designed to tax us imports significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
this determination is highly complex and requires detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if we receive an adverse ruling during an audit  or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the myriad tax regulations to which we are subject  there could be a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable and therefore need to be reduced or written off altogether include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow or growth estimates  and reduction in use or discontinuation of the purchased products 
in the event we determine that there is an impairment  we are required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined 
this charge will correspondingly reduce our results of operations  perhaps materially 
changes in accounting may affect our reported earnings and operating income 
generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements  implementation guidelines  and interpretations for many aspects of our business  such as revenue recognition for software  stock based compensation accounting  taxes  accounting for investments  and treatment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets  are highly complex and involve subjective judgments 
changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in our products or business could significantly change our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant uncertainty and volatility to those measures

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  management views the us and international reportable segments separately in operating our business  although the products and services are similar for each segment 
we continue to see growth in the hospitality and retail industries  while some sectors experience slower growth  it has historically tended to be offset by faster growth in other areas 
recently  it has been reported in the press that the table service restaurant industry has experienced slower growth or declines as measured in same store sales  while this tends to reduce purchases  we have not experienced any material adverse impact from this reported decline 
we have also seen growth in our quick service restaurant business  including that generated by sales to various quick service restaurant chains with whom we have announced alliances 
additional material risks are discussed in section a of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those that impact revenue recognition and those related to stock based compensation  capitalized software  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolescence  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue consists of software license revenue  hardware revenue  and service revenue 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements using the residual method prescribed by sop  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
software license revenue  hardware revenue and service and support revenue are generally recognized when the four basic criteria of sop are met as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we consider a contract signed by both parties of the agreement or a purchase order received from the customer persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery occurs at the time of shipment if the risk of ownership has passed to the buyer or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the license fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is payable within twelve months of delivery 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
we consider service fees to be fixed or determinable if the service fee or rates for time and material contracts are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable we perform a credit review for significant transactions at the time the arrangement is executed to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  revenue recognition is deferred until collection 
cost of sales includes costs related to shipping and handling and billable travel expenses 
the revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns and allowances 
hardware hardware revenue is typically recognized at the time of shipment if the risk of ownership has passed to the buyer in accordance with statement of accounting bulletin sab if the risk of ownership has not passed to the buyer at the time of shipment  recognition of the hardware revenue is deferred until the risk has passed to the buyer 
software if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  recognition of the software revenue is deferred until the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
if a third party can install the software  revenue is recognized when shipped  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
however  if we are the sole party that has the proprietary knowledge to install the software  revenue is recognized upon installation and when ready to go live  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements using the residual method prescribed by sop  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe of fair value for our services including maintenance agreements are based upon separate sales of those arrangements  which are consistently applied 
under the residual method  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue when the basic criteria in sop are met 
typically  payments for software licenses are due within twelve months of the agreement date 
when software license agreements call for escalating payment terms  or payment terms of twelve months or more from the delivery date  software revenue is recognized as payments become due and only if all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
service service revenue consists of maintenance support  installation revenue  customer specific development work and more recently also includes software hosting service 
maintenance support and software hosting services are initially recorded as deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the contract term 
installation services  which include project management  systems planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  training and assistance activating our products are recognized as the work is performed 
our software is ready to use by the customer upon receipt 
while many of our customers may choose to tailor the software to fit their specific needs or require our assistance activating our programs  our implementation services do not typically involve significant customization to or development of the underlying source code 
when we provide services deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software products licensed or the licensed software requires significant production  modification or customization  we recognize revenue under the completed contract method in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
once acceptance occurs  revenue is recognized for all delivered elements based on vsoe  and maintenance service revenue is deferred over the contract period 
the completed contract method of accounting is preferred over the percentage of completion method as the production cycles are usually not long term less than one year

 accounting for stock based compensation and superseding accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees became effective july   and requires us to expense the fair value of grants made under the stock option program over the vesting period of the plans 
we adopted the modified prospective application transition method  which does not result in restatement of previously issued financial statements

r are valued and non cash share based compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with sfas no 
r 
in addition  non vested awards that were granted before the effective date of sfas no 
r also result in recognition of non cash share based compensation expense 
we value stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions 
in determining the expected term  we separate groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar behavior with regard to option exercises and post vesting cancellations 
the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  such as those listed below 
the volatility rates are based on historical stock prices 
the expected life of options granted are based on historical data  which  as of june  is a partial option life cycle  adjusted for the remaining option life cycle by assuming ratable exercise of any unexercised vested options over the remaining term 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the total expense to be recorded in future periods will depend on several variables  including the number of share based awards that vest  pre vesting cancellations  and the fair value of those vested awards 
we recognize non cash share based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period  which generally equals the vesting period of options  adjusted for expected forfeitures 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out pricing method 
we maintain a reserve for obsolescence for inventory in the amount of approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which could affect our financial results in future periods 
allowances for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
additionally  bad debt expenses for the fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
capitalized software development costs software development costs for software products to be licensed to others  incurred before establishing technological feasibility  are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility and purchased software costs are capitalized on a product by product basis until the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization begins 
annual amortization  charged to cost of sales  is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
if management misjudges the remaining economic life of a product  it could have a material effect on future results because the unamortized expenses may need to be written off 
long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when indicators of impairment are present  we compare the fair value of the assets  based on the undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate  to the book value of the assets 
if the fair value is less than book value  the asset is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss represents the excess of book value over fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or market values  if available 
finite lived purchased intangible assets are being amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  which range from one to ten years 
we did not recognize any impairment losses on long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  during the last three fiscal years ended june  goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets 
we assess whether goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its book value 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a weighting of the income and market approaches to value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
trademarks are our only indefinite lived purchased intangible asset 
trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing their fair value to book value 
we estimate the fair value of trademarks using an income approach to value  and recognize an impairment loss if the estimated fair value of a trademark is less than its book value 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and or trademarks is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting segments with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting segments 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date the analysis is performed 
a determination that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired could result in a significant change in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if we determine that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination is made 
foreign currency translation the financial statements of our non us operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
the assets and liabilities of non us operations whose functional currencies are not in us dollars are translated at the fiscal year end exchange rates  while revenues and expenses are translated at month end exchange rates during the fiscal year which approximated weighted average exchange rates 
the cumulative translation effects are reflected as our sole component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
gains and losses on monetary transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an operation are reflected in other income expense 
results of operations all prior period share data  including net income per share  are presented on a stock split adjusted basis to reflect january two for one stock split
