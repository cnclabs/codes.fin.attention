item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction 
fonar was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america  also referred to as hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its stand up tm upright tm mri and fonar tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the company has been aggressively seeking new sales and during fiscal and  respectively received orders for and stand up tm mri scanners 
the stand up tm mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
in fiscal  we received our first order for a tm mri scanner  bringing the total number of orders for our mri scanners to in fiscal at tesla field strength  the upright tm mri and fonar tm magnets are among the highest field open mri scanners in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength mri scanners in the industry 
hmca commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services  including development  administration  accounting  billing and collection services  together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of fees which are earned under contracts with mri facilities and physical rehabilitation practices 
since april  hmca has not engaged in the management of primary care medical practices 
since july  hmca has engaged only in the management of mri facilities  having sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation practices 
for the fiscal years ended june   june   and  respectively  of hmca s revenues were derived from contracts with facilities and practices owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with the mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees are based on the number of procedures performed and currently range from to per mri scan 
the fees are reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
effective as of june  agreements were entered into with new practices with the new owners of the physical therapy and rehabilitation practices who had no affiliation with dr 
damadian  fonar or hmca 
these agreements were assigned in connection with the sale of the portion of hmca s business managing physical therapy and rehabilitation practices 
historically  adjustments were made on the basis of changes in hmca s costs  plus a percentage of costs 
the monthly fees under these contracts with the physical rehabilitation practices ranged from approximately  to  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanners  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs is to years  years and years  respectively 
we periodically assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced a net loss of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net income of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represents a decrease in revenues of 
this was due mostly to decreased product sales and management fees 
in addition  notwithstanding decreased revenues  total cost and expenses decreased by only 
we have been reluctant to make drastic cuts to date because we anticipate that our sales results will improve and we will need to have maintained our current capacity 
our consolidated operating results decreased by million to an operating loss of million for fiscal as compared to an operating income of million for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting a decrease in product sales revenues of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  offset by an increase in service revenue of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline in revenues was attributable to a reduction in sales of our upright tm mri 
notwithstanding the dramatic decrease in revenues  which are recognized at certain benchmarks in the production of the scanner  the decline in orders was not as great  decreasing from scanners in fiscal to scanners in fiscal we attribute this decline primarily to a concern on the part of potential customers about mri scan reimbursements from medical insurance  no fault insurance  worker s compensation and federal and state programs  most significantly medicare and medicaid 
even in our own management of mri facilities by hmca  we have noticed an increasing resistance to paying claims by insurers 
also of concern is the deficit reduction act which  if it becomes law  is expected to reduce medicare funding available for mri imaging 
we anticipate an improvement in our upright tm mri sales because the upright tm mri is unique in that it permits mri scans to be performed on patients upright in the weight bearing state and in multiple positions that correlate with symptoms 
an important event in our ongoing effort to educate both the medical community and payors about the benefits  if not necessity  of utilizing upright tm mri scanning  occurred subsequent to the end of fiscal when we sold an upright tm mri scanner to the largest orthopedic hospital in the netherlands  st 
maartenskliniek 
upon placing the order  the chairman of spine surgery at st 
maartenskliniek expressed the view that for their hospital to continue to engage in spine surgery without fonar s upright tm mri technology  now that it was available was unacceptable and that owning the scanner was not optional  but mandatory 
he further stated that once our active research program has discovered the benefits of this new fonar technology for patients  we intend to publish the results in a lot of peer reviewed scientific journals 
in addition  significant progress is being made in developing the fonar tm mri scanner so that it can be used in interventional procedures 
at the oxford nuffield site in the united kingdom  where we installed the first fonar tm mri  fonar software engineers have completed and installed our nd generation tracking software  which is designed to enable the surgeons to insert needles into the patient and accurately advance them under direct visual image guidance to the target tissue  such as a tumor  in order to inject therapeutic agents directly into the tissue 
the increase in service revenue is a result primarily of our increase scanner base  as scanners sold in previous years become service customers after the warranty period expires 
during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  we received orders for and upright tm mri scanners 
in addition to upright tm mri scanners  we received our first order for a fonar tm scanner in fiscal  the installation of which was completed in fiscal product sales to unrelated parties decreased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales to related parties decreased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we believe that one of our principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration is attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of our larger competitors such as general electric  siemens  hitachi  philips and toshiba and the ability of some of our competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the upright tm mri  and the general electric medical systems division of general electric acts as a manufacturer s representative for the stand up tm mri 
we believe that our aggregate product sales to unrelated parties of upright tm scanners shows that we are successfully meeting that challenge 
the operating results for the medical equipment segment declined by million from an income of  in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this decline is attributable to a decrease in our scanner sales 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our upright tm mri scanners and the balance of  from the sale of our first fonar tm mri scanner in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of upright tm mri scanners and  from the sale of our first fonar tm mri scanner in fiscal sales of mri scanners to related parties  consisting of professional corporations and other entities in which dr 
damadian or members of his family have an interest represented approximately  or million  of our revenues in fiscal  as compared to  or million  of our revenues in fiscal we believe concerns about payor reimbursements adversely affected these sales as well as sales to unrelated parties 
license and royalty revenue declined to in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  increased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse tm and new surface coils to be used with the stand up tm mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues reflected decreases resulting from sale of hmca s physical therapy and rehabilitation facility management business 
hmca has elected to manage only mri facilities 
presently  ten of the mri facilities managed by hmca have upright tm mri scanners and additional upgrades are planned 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment increased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  this resulted from our inability to benefit from reduced costs per scanner that would have resulted if there had been a higher volume of sales in fiscal operating results of this segment declined from an operating income of  in fiscal to operating loss of million in fiscal we attribute the decline to hmca s sale of its physical therapy and rehabilitation facility management business 
discussion of certain consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in interest rates on our investments in marketable securities 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal  increasing from  in fiscal and representing a increase of 
the increase was attributable primarily to new capital lease obligations 
notwithstanding that revenue decreased by  selling  general and administrative expenses  exclusive of compensatory element of stock issuances  decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal essentially  we decided not to cut payroll and other overhead expenditures since we anticipate that sales will improve and we will be in a better position if we maintain our capacity 
the decrease in compensatory element of stock issuances from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal reflected the continued but reduced use of fonar s stock bonus plans to pay certain highly compensated employees and others in stock rather than in cash 
the higher provision for bad debt of million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  reflected an increase in reserves and write offs of certain indebtedness by our physician and diagnostic services management segment 
this reflected a higher level of concern over the ability of hmca s clients to pay past management fees due to issues and the settlement of issues with payors 
we are enthusiastic about the future of our upright tm mri and fonar tm scanners which bring a new plateau of openness to diagnostic mri and are expected to bring a new frontier in performing mri guided intervention 
we believe our new products have begun to successfully penetrate the market  as reflected in the dramatic increase in product sales from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal  notwithstanding lower revenues of million in fiscal in addition to our success with our upright tm mri  we received an order for our first fonar tm in the first quarter of fiscal service and repair fees also have steadily increased  as reflected by the increase in service and repair fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal continuing our tradition as the originator of mri  we remain committed to maintaining our position as a leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development 
in fiscal we continued our investment in the development of our new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development   of which was capitalized  as compared to   of which was capitalized  in fiscal the research and development expenditures were approximately of revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment  and of total revenues  in and of medical equipment segment revenues  and of total revenues in fiscal this represented a increase in research and development expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal in summary  fonar s trend of steadily increasing mri scanner sales  most dramatically the increase in upright tm mri scanner sales revenues from fiscal through fiscal  experienced a setback in fiscal we anticipate that scanner sales revenues will improve due to the unique capability of the upright tm mri scanner to scan patients in weight bearing positions and future sales of the fonar tm for image guided interventional procedures and treatments 
service revenues have increased over the past five fiscal years 
the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  revenues increased  from million in fiscal to in fiscal and then decreased to million in fiscal this is primarily attributed to the sale of hmca s physical therapy and rehabilitation facility management business  which had generated revenues of million in fiscal we have been taking steps to improve hmca revenues by closing unprofitable facilities and continuing our program of replacing the mri scanners at the mri facilities we manage with upright tm mri scanners and opening new facilities equipped with upright tm mri scanners 
marketing expenditures are likely to increase  as the company continues its efforts to promote sales 
in the beginning of fiscal  hmca sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities in july of to health plus management services  llc for a purchase price of million  payable pursuant to a promissory note in monthly installments 
the first twelve installments are interest only and the remaining payments will consist of equal installments of principal and interest in the amount of  each 
the note is secured by a first lien on all of the assets of health plus  including its accounts receivable 
the note is subject to prepayment provisions to the extent health plus resells all or part of the assets and business or utilizes the assets sold as collateral in any debt financing 
hmca had recognized revenue from the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities of approximately million during both fiscal and  but only  in fiscal due to the sale of this portion of hmca s business in july  in connection with this sale  hmca recognized a diminimus loss during the quarter ended september  in addition  hmca recorded a one time charge to earnings during the quarter ended september  of million related to the termination of the employment contracts of the two principal individuals involved in the management of the physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced net income of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represented an increase in revenues of 
this was due in part to the fact that while revenues increased by  total costs and expenses increased by only 
our consolidated operating results improved by million to operating income of million for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting an increase in product sales revenues of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and an increase in service revenue of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement in revenues was attributable to an increase in sales of our upright tm mri 
the increase in service revenue was a result primarily of our increased scanner base  as scanners sold in previous years became service customers after the warranty period expired 
during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  we received orders for and upright tm mri scanners 
in addition to upright tm mri scanners  we received our first order for a fonar tm mri scanner 
confirming our expectation of increased demand for our mri scanners  product sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales to related parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the upright tm mri  and the general electric medical systems division of general electric acts as a manufacturer s representative for the upright tm mri 
the operating results for the medical equipment segment improved by million from a loss of million in fiscal to an income of  in fiscal this improvement was attributable to our continuing increase in recognition of revenues on our scanner sales 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our upright tm mri scanners and  from the sales of a fonar tm mri scanner in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of upright tm mri scanners 
sales of mri scanners to related parties  consisting of professional corporations and other entities in which dr 
damadian or members of his family have an interest represented approximately  or million  of our revenues in fiscal  as compared to  or million  of our revenues in fiscal license and royalty revenue declined by to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  increased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse tm and new surface coils to be used with the upright tm mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues reflected anticipated increases provided by upgraded facilities 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment increased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  operating results of this segment improved from an operating loss of  in fiscal to operating income of  in fiscal we believe this improvement resulted from hmca s focus on upgrading sites by the introduction of upright tm mri scanners at mri facilities 
discussion of certain consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in interest rates on our investments in marketable securities 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal decreasing from  in fiscal and representing a decrease of 
the decrease was attributable primarily to the repayment of debt and capital lease obligations in fiscal notwithstanding that revenue increased by  selling  general and administrative expenses  exclusive of compensatory element of stock issuances  increased by only to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  accounting in part for our increase in net income 
this increase was related to expenses incurred in our medical segment related to marketing and customer relations programs  such as participating in a trade show  increased commissions  and an in house seminar for all owners of upright mri tm scanners and increased professional fees 
a portion of the increased professional fees was related to the engagement of outside consultants to assist us in preparation of internal documentation in connection with our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition we incurred expenses in connection with the defense of non material litigation 
the decrease in compensatory element of stock issuances from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal reflected the continued but reduced use of fonar s stock bonus plans to pay certain highly compensated employees and others in stock rather than in cash

in summary  in fiscal  fonar continued the trend of steadily increasing mri scanner sales  most dramatically the increase in upright tm mri scanner sales revenues and in service revenues from fiscal through fiscal the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  revenues also continued to increase  from million in fiscal to in fiscal and to million in fiscal we also increased hmca revenues by closing unprofitable facilities and continuing our program of replacing the mri scanners at the mri facilities with upright tm mri scanners and opening new facilities equipped with upright tm mri scanners 
hmca sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities in july of to health plus management services  llc for a purchase price of million  payable pursuant to a promissory note in monthly installments
