item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview the company s administrative headquarters are in tontitown  arkansas 
from this location we manage operations conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries based in various locations around the united states and canada 
the operations of these subsidiaries can generally be classified into either truckload services or brokerage and logistics services 
truckload services include those transportation services in which we utilize company owned tractors or owner operator owned tractors 
brokerage and logistics services consist of services such as transportation scheduling  routing  mode selection  transloading and other value added services related to the transportation of freight which may or may not involve the usage of company owned or owner operator owned equipment 
both our truckload operations and our brokerage logistics operations have similar economic characteristics and are impacted by virtually the same economic factors as discussed elsewhere in this report 
all of the company s operations are in the motor carrier segment 
for both operations  substantially all of our revenue is generated by transporting freight for customers and is predominantly affected by the rates per mile received from our customers  equipment utilization  and our percentage of non compensated miles 
these aspects of our business are carefully managed and efforts are continuously underway to achieve favorable results 
truckload services revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  represented   and of total revenues  excluding fuel surcharges for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are costs incurred in transporting freight for our customers 
currently our most challenging costs include fuel  driver recruitment  training  wage and benefit costs  independent broker costs which we record as purchased transportation  insurance  and maintenance and capital equipment costs 
in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge  and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue allows a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
during  and  approximately million  million and million of the company s total revenue was generated from fuel surcharges 
we also discuss certain changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the high variable cost nature of certain expenses makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
results of operations truckload services the following table sets forth  for truckload services  the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  for the periods indicated 
operating supplies expense  which includes fuel costs  are shown net of fuel surcharges 
years ended december  operating revenues  before fuel surcharge operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits operating supplies  net of fuel surcharge rent and purchased transportation depreciation and amortization operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communications and utilities other loss on sale or disposal of property total operating expenses operating income non operating income interest expense income before income taxes compared to for the year ended december   truckload services revenue  before fuel surcharges  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a increase in the average rate per total mile charged to customers from during to during the revenue growth attributable to the increase in the average rate per total mile was partially offset by a reduction in total miles traveled from million during to million during salaries  wages and benefits decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease relates primarily to a decrease in driver lease expense  which is a component of salaries  wages and benefits  as the average number of owner operators under contract decreased from during to during the decrease associated with driver lease expense was partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to the corresponding company driver replacement  and in other costs normally absorbed by the owner operator such as repairs and fuel 
although to a lesser degree  the effect of higher revenues without a corresponding increase in those wages with fixed cost characteristics  such as general and administrative wages  also contributed to the decrease in salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of revenues  before fuel surcharges 
during january the company implemented a driver pay increase ranging from 
to 
per mile depending on individual driver qualifications and expect salaries  wages and benefits to increase as a result 
operating supplies and expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs resulting from a increase in the average price per gallon paid by the company during as compared to during periods of rising fuel prices the company is often able to recoup at least a portion of the increase through fuel surcharges passed along to its customers 
fuel costs  net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in from million in the company collected approximately million in fuel surcharges during and million during fuel costs were also affected by the replacement of owner operators with company drivers as discussed above 
rent and purchased transportation increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates primarily to an increase in amounts paid to third party transportation service providers for intermodal services 
depreciation and amortization decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in depreciation expense increased from million during to million during primarily due to higher new tractor and trailer prices coupled with decreased residual trade in values guaranteed by the manufacturer  however as a percentage of revenues  before fuel surcharges  a decrease results from the interaction of increased revenues from an increased rate per mile charged to customers and the fixed cost nature of depreciation expense 
operating taxes and licenses decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in operating taxes and licenses which consist primarily of fuel taxes and tractor and trailer registration fees increased slightly from million during to million during fuel tax expense is primarily affected by both the number of miles traveled and the miles per gallon mpg achieved 
during the company experienced a lower mpg of as compared to a mpg of during  resulting primarily from the replacement of older tractors with new tractors containing engines which comply with the epa mandated lower emissions standards 
the increased costs associated with a lower mpg were offset by a decrease in the number of miles traveled during to million from million during tractor and trailer registration fees  the majority of which are fixed on a per unit basis  did not change significantly as the number of units remained relatively the same  however the fixed cost nature of these expenses did decrease as a percentage of revenues  before fuel surcharges due to higher revenues during as compared to insurance and claims expense decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease was the result of renegotiations with one of the company s insurance providers to change the method of determining the company s auto liability insurance premiums 
previously  the company s auto liability premiums were determined using a specified rate per one hundred dollars of revenue including fuel surcharges 
this method had the unintended consequence of penalizing the company with increased insurance costs solely from passing higher fuel costs along to its customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the method of determining the company s auto liability premium is now based on the number of miles traveled instead of revenue generated 
other expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates to the combined net effect of an increase in current amounts written off as uncollectible truckload services revenues and a decrease in recoveries of prior year uncollectible truckload services revenue during as compared to during the company expensed an additional million of truckload services accounts receivable as uncollectible without any significant recoveries related to prior years 
during  was expensed as uncollectible truckload services accounts receivable  however this amount was completely offset by the recovery of  during related to the settlement of a lawsuit which allowed the company to recapture approximately  of previously reported expense 
the increase in other expenses was partially offset by a decrease in amounts paid for advertising expense during as compared to the truckload services division operating ratio  which measures the ratio of operating expenses  net of fuel surcharges  to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  decreased to for from for compared to for the year ended december   truckload services revenue  before fuel surcharges  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  approximately million of the million increase was attributable to the mcneill trucking  inc asset acquisition which closed on april  and therefore had no comparable revenue for the first three months of the remaining increase was due to an increase in the average rate per total mile charged to customers from during to during salaries  wages and benefits decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease relates to the effect of a higher average rate per mile charged to customers without a corresponding increase in salaries and wages 
however  effective october  a driver pay increase of approximately 
per mile was implemented which began to partially offset the benefit of recent rate increases charged to customers 
driver lease expense which is a component of salaries  wages and benefits  also decreased during as the average number of owner operators under contract decreased from during to during this decrease in driver lease expense was partially offset by an increase in amounts paid to the corresponding company driver replacement  and in other costs normally absorbed by the owner operator such as repairs and fuel 
also contributing to the decrease in salaries  wages and benefits was the continued benefit of the restructuring of workers compensation plans which resulted in a decrease in amounts expensed for workers compensation coverage 
operating supplies and expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs resulting from a increase in the average price per gallon paid by the company during as compared to during periods of rising fuel prices the company is often able to recoup at least a portion of the increase through fuel surcharges passed along to its customers 
fuel costs  net of fuel surcharges  increased to million in from million in the company collected approximately million in fuel surcharges during and million during fuel costs were also affected by the replacement of owner operators with company drivers as discussed above 
also contributing to the increase in operating supplies and expenses were increased costs associated with our student training program as the number of students increased during as compared to rent and purchased transportation increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates primarily to rental and mileage fees incurred on equipment used past scheduled trade in dates due to manufacturers delays in providing replacement equipment 
depreciation and amortization increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase was primarily due to the combined effect of higher tractor purchase prices and lower tractor guaranteed residual values offered by manufacturers 
insurance and claims expense increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase in expense relates to the purchase of additional auto liability coverage which was not in place during and to an increase in the amount of auto liability claims incurred by the company 
other expenses increased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the increase relates to an increase in amounts paid for both driver recruitment advertising and fees paid to the company s external auditors both of which were partially offset by the settlement of a lawsuit which allowed the company to recapture approximately  of previously reported expense 
the recapture contributed approximately 
to both diluted and basic earnings per share 
the truckload services division operating ratio  which measures the ratio of operating expenses  net of fuel surcharges  to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  increased to for from for results of operations logistics and brokerage services the following table sets forth  for logistics and brokerage services  the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenues  before fuel surcharges  for the periods indicated 
brokerage service operations occur specifically in certain divisions  however  brokerage operations occur throughout the company in similar operations having substantially similar economic characteristics 
rent and purchased transportation  which includes costs paid to third party carriers  are shown net of fuel surcharges 
years ended december  operating revenues  before fuel surcharge operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits operating supplies  net of fuel surcharge rent and purchased transportation depreciation and amortization operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communications and utilities other loss on sale or disposal of property total operating expenses operating income non operating income interest expense income before income taxes compared to logistics and brokerage services revenues  before fuel surcharges  decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of loads serviced by the company during as compared to this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue collected per load resulting from increased fees charged by the company 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease relates to a decrease in the number of employees employed by the logistics and brokerage services division

rent and purchased transportation decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease reflects the change attributable to higher rates collected from customers without a corresponding increase in cost 
other expenses decreased from of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in to of revenues  before fuel surcharges  in the decrease relates to a decrease in amounts paid for professional services due to the hiring of an administrative staff at east coast transport  llc for functions which had previously been outsourced

this reclassification has no effect on net operating income  net income or earnings per share 
the company has made corresponding reclassifications to comparative periods shown 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  proceeds from the sales of revenue equipment  issuances of equity securities  and borrowings under our line of credit 
during  we generated million in cash from operating activities compared to million and million in and  respectively 
investing activities used million in cash during compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the cash used in all three years related primarily to the purchase of revenue equipment tractors and trailers used in our operations 
financing activities used million in cash during compared to million used in and to million generated in see consolidated statements of cash flows 
our primary use of funds is for the purchase of revenue equipment 
we typically use our existing lines of credit on an interim basis  in addition to cash flows from operations  to finance capital expenditures and repay long term debt 
during and  we utilized cash on hand and our lines of credit to finance revenue equipment purchases for an aggregate of million and million  respectively 
occasionally we finance the acquisition of revenue equipment through installment notes with fixed interest rates and terms ranging from to months  however as of december  and  we had no outstanding indebtedness under such installment notes 
in order to maintain our tractor and trailer fleet count it is often necessary to purchase replacement units and place them in service before trade units are removed from service 
the timing difference created during this process often requires the company to pay for new units without any reduction in price for trade units 
in this situation  the company later receives payment for the trade units as they are delivered to the equipment vendor and have passed vendor inspection 
during the twelve months ended december  and  the company received approximately million and million  respectively  for units delivered for trade 
we maintain a million revolving line of credit and a million revolving line of credit line a and line b  respectively with separate financial institutions 
amounts outstanding under line a bear interest at libor determined as of the first day of each month plus  at december  are secured by our accounts receivable and mature on may   however the company has the intent and ability to extend the terms of this line of credit for an additional one year period until may  at december  outstanding advances on line a were approximately million  including  in letters of credit  with availability to borrow million 
amounts outstanding under line b bear interest at libor determined on the last day of the previous month plus  at december  are secured by revenue equipment and mature on june  at december   million  including million in letters of credit were outstanding under line b with availability to borrow million 
in an effort to reduce interest rate risk associated with these floating rate facilities  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of million 
for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements  see item a of this report 
cash and cash equivalents at december  decreased approximately million as compared to december  during december the company purchased million of treasury stock and paid a million estimated federal income tax payment neither of which were done during december of the remaining decrease is attributable to accounts receivable payments from one of the company s largest customers not being received until january instead of by the end of december as had happened in december see accounts receivable discussion below and the consolidated statements of cash flows for more information 
accounts receivable at december  increased approximately million as compared to december  during late december the company received an accounts receivable payment from one of its larger customers which was not due until january this early payment was not repeated in december as the company received the accounts receivable payment in january the remaining increase was primarily related to a general increase in revenues as a whole  all of which flow through our accounts receivable account 
marketable equity securities available for sale at december  increased approximately million as compared to december  during the year ended december   the company purchased approximately million of equity securities with excess cash with the remaining increase attributable to an increase in the market value of the investments 
these securities  combined with equity securities purchased in prior periods  have an original cost of approximately million and a combined fair market value of million 
the company has developed a strategy to invest in securities from which it expects to receive dividends that qualify for favorable tax treatment  as well as  appreciate in value 
the company anticipates that increases in the market value of the investments combined with dividend payments will exceed interest rates paid on borrowings for the same period 
during the company had net unrealized pre tax gains of approximately  and received dividends of approximately  the holding term of these securities depends largely on the general economic environment  the equity markets  borrowing rates and the company s cash requirements 
accounts payable at december  decreased approximately million as compared to december  the decrease is primarily related to a decrease in the amount of bank drafts outstanding in excess of bank balance as compared to bank drafts outstanding at december  as of december  bank drafts of approximately million were reclassified to accounts payable as compared to approximately million reclassified as of december  the net decrease also reflects the increase of approximately million in amounts accrued for third party commissions and a million increase in amounts accrued for fuel purchases 
long term debt at december  increased approximately million as compared to december  the increase is primarily related to an increase in the balance due on the company s lines of credit at december  as compared to december  additional borrowings were required due to an increase in treasury stock purchases of million and million in income tax payments during as compared to treasury stock at december  increased approximately million as the company purchased  shares of its common stock at various times throughout as part of a stock repurchase plan approved by the company s board of directors in april the stock repurchase plan  as extended in september  authorizes the purchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock and expires in september for  we expect to purchase approximately new tractors and approximately trailers while continuing to sell or trade older equipment  which we expect to result in net capital expenditures of approximately million 
management believes we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next twelve months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash balances  cash flows from operations  and borrowings believed to be available from financing sources 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  as defined in regulation s k a ii issued by the securities and exchange commission  as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt    operating leases  total     represents building  facilities  and drop yard operating leases 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii issued by the securities and exchange commission 
insurance with respect to physical damage for tractors  cargo loss and auto liability  the company maintains insurance coverage to protect it from certain business risks 
these policies are with various carriers and have per occurrence deductibles of   and  respectively 
since  the company has elected to self insure for physical damage to trailers 
during  and continuing through  the company changed its workers compensation coverage in arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi and florida from a fully insured policy with a  per occurrence deductible to become self insured with a  per occurrence excess policy 
the company continues to be self insured for workers compensation in the state of ohio with a  self insured retention with excess insurance 
the company has elected to opt out of workers compensation coverage in texas and is providing coverage through the pam texas injury plan 
the company has reserved for estimated losses to pay such claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
the company has not experienced any adverse trends involving differences in claims experienced versus claims estimates for workers compensation claims 
letters of credit aggregating  are held by a bank as security for workers compensation claims 
the company self insures for employee health claims with a stop loss of  per covered employee per year and estimates its liability for claims incurred but not reported 
inflation inflation has an impact on most of our operating costs 
recently  the effect of inflation has been minimal 
competition for drivers has increased in recent years  leading to increased labor costs 
while increases in fuel and driver costs affect our operating costs  we do not believe that the effects of such increases are greater for us than for other trucking concerns 
adoption of accounting policies see item financial statements and supplementary data  note to the consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to the company s operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers  third parties and vendors and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
property and equipment 
management must use its judgment in the selection of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers which in some cases do not have guaranteed residual values 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal which  in many cases include guaranteed residual values by the manufacturers 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data either provided by outside claims administrators or developed internally 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized in full upon completion of delivery to the receiver s location 
for freight in transit at the end of a reporting period  the company recognizes revenue prorata based on relative transit miles completed as a portion of the estimated total transit miles 
expenses are recognized as incurred 
prepaid tires 
tires purchased with revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the related equipment 
replacement tires are included in prepaid expenses and deposits and are amortized over a month period 
costs related to tire recapping are expensed when incurred 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed to be necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial circumstances were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  judgment would need to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
business combinations and goodwill 
upon acquisition of an entity  the cost of the acquired entity must be allocated to assets and liabilities acquired 
identification of intangible assets  if any  that meet certain recognition criteria is necessary 
this identification and subsequent valuation requires significant judgments 
the carrying value of goodwill is tested annually and as of december  the company determined that there was no impairment 
the impairment testing requires an estimate of the value of the company as a whole  as the company has determined it only has one reporting unit as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risk exposures include equity price risk  interest rate risk  and commodity price risk the price paid to obtain diesel fuel for our tractors 
the potential adverse impact of these risks and the general strategies we employ to manage such risks are discussed below 
the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that an adverse change may have on the overall economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results of changes in prices or rates may differ materially from the hypothetical results described below 
equity price risk we hold certain actively traded marketable equity securities which subjects the company to fluctuations in the fair market value of its investment portfolio based on current market price 
the recorded value of marketable equity securities increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase reflects additional purchases of approximately million during and an increase in the fair market value of approximately  during a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or approximately million 
for additional information with respect to the marketable equity securities  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our two lines of credit each bear interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus a fixed percentage 
accordingly  changes in libor  which are effected by changes in interest rates  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  the lines of credit 
in an effort to manage the risks associated with changing interest rates  we entered into interest rate swap agreements effective february  and may   on notional amounts of  and  respectively 
the pay fixed rates under the  and  swap agreements are and  respectively 
the receive floating rate for both swap agreements is month libor 
these interest rate swap agreements terminate on march  and june   respectively 
assuming million of variable rate debt was outstanding under line a and not covered by a hedge agreement for a full fiscal year  a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would result in approximately  of additional interest expense 
for additional information with respect to the interest rate swap agreements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside of our control 
accordingly  the price and availability of diesel fuel  as well as other petroleum products  can be unpredictable 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
based upon our fuel consumption  a increase in the average annual price per gallon of diesel fuel would increase our annual fuel expenses by million 
in july  we entered into an agreement to obtain price protection and reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
under this agreement  we were obligated to purchase minimum amounts of diesel fuel per month  with a price protection component  for the six month period ended february  the agreement also provided that if during the twelve month period commencing january  the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange ny mx ho fell below 
per gallon  we would have been obligated to pay the contract holder the difference between 
per gallon and the ny mx ho average price  multiplied by  gallons 
accordingly  in any month in which the holder exercised such right  we would have been obligated to pay the holder  for each cent by which 
exceeded the average ny mx ho price for that month 
for example  if the ny mx ho average price during march was approximately  and if the holder were to exercise its payment right  we would have been obligated to pay the holder approximately  during the twelve month period commencing january the average ny mx ho price remained well above the 
per gallon threshold and as of december  the agreement expired without any further obligation of either party 
for the twelve month period ended december  an adjustment of  was made to reflect the decline in fair value of the agreement which had the effect of reducing operating supplies expense and other current liabilities each by  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for the twelve month period ended december  an adjustment of  was made to reflect the decline in fair value of the agreement which had the effect of reducing operating supplies expense and other current liabilities each by  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  see note to our consolidated financial statements
