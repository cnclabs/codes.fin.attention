forward looking statements and risk factors this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements for eastman chemical company eastman or the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  impaired assets  environmental costs  us pension and other post employment benefits  litigation and contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition and results 
these policies require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company believes  based on historical results  the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share is low 
however  if one of the company s key customers were to file for bankruptcy  or otherwise be unable to make its required payments  or there was a significant continued slow down in the economy  the company could be forced to increase its allowances 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
for trade receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively  the company s allowances were million and million  respectively 
impaired assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the asset  adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  significant changes in business climate  or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
for long lived assets to be held and used  fair value of fixed tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or an appraisal 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale  fair value is determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value  as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products  is less than their carrying value 
the company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of each year  unless events warrant more frequent testing 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as the company s assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in a charge to earnings 
the company recorded fixed tangible asset impairments of million and definite lived intangible asset impairments of million during the company recorded fixed tangible asset impairments of million  definite lived intangible asset impairments of million  and indefinite lived intangible asset impairments of million during the company recorded fixed tangible asset impairments of million  definite lived intangible asset impairments of million  indefinite lived intangible asset impairments of million  and goodwill impairments of million during environmental costs the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the company also establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains 
environmental assets  as defined in sfas no 
 include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
currently  the company estimates the useful life of each individual asset up to years 
if the company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets  expenses to be charged into earnings could increase or decrease 
the company s reserve for environmental contingencies was million and million at december  and  respectively  representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and  for asset retirement obligation costs  the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives 
united states pension and other post employment benefits the company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits 
additionally  eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates and expected return on plan assets 
at december   the company assumed a discount rate of percent and an expected return on assets of percent 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for us pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans change in assumption impact on pre tax us benefits expense impact on december  projected benefit obligation for us pension plans impact on december  benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans basis point decrease in discount rate million million million basis point increase in discount rate million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million no impact n a basis point increase in expected return on assets million no impact n a the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the company s pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each december the expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds  primarily the domestic  international  and private equities markets 
the assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of approximately grade aa corporate bonds  which are used to develop a yield curve 
this yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain loss and then amortized into earnings over a period of time  which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease 
the charges applied to earnings in   and due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses  largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates  were million  million  and million  respectively 
the actual return on assets has exceeded the expected return for the last years and a percent increase or decrease in the health care trend would have had no material impact 
the company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during however  an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  as of december  for the impact on the pension s projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates  if any 
while the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements  it is an indication of the amount the company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years 
the amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates  actual returns on plan assets  retirement  attrition rates of employees  and other factors 
for further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  the company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
the company expenses legal costs  including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency  as incurred 
the company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company 
income taxes the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided against the deferred tax assets

as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  eastman has a percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in primester  a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at the company s kingsport  tennessee plant 
during fourth quarter  the company provided a line of credit to the joint venture of up to million  which primester fully utilized to pay the principal amount of the joint venture s third party borrowings  previously guaranteed by eastman 
as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  eastman entered into an agreement in that allows it to generate cash by reducing its working capital through the sale of undivided interests in certain domestic trade accounts receivable under a planned continuous sale program to a third party 
under this agreement  receivables sold to the third party totaled million at december  and undivided interests in designated receivable pools were sold to the purchaser with recourse limited to the purchased interest in the receivable pools 
the company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
thus  eastman is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships 
the company has evaluated material relationships including the guarantees related to the third party borrowings of joint ventures described above and has concluded that the entities are not variable interest entities vies or  in the case of primester  the company is not the primary beneficiary of the vie 
as such  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation number  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  the company is not required to consolidate these entities 
in addition  the company has evaluated long term purchase obligations with two entities that may be vies at december  these potential vies are joint ventures from which the company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and purchases approximately million of raw materials and utilities on an annual basis 
the company has no equity interest in these entities and has confirmed that one party to each of these joint ventures does consolidate the potential vie 
however  due to competitive and other reasons  the company has not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the entities are vies  and if one or both are vies  whether or not the company is the primary beneficiary 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers  customers  and non consolidated affiliates when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company 
these potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products  intellectual property and environmental matters  and other indemnifications 
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims 
however  while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized  management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity

environmental certain eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment  storage  transportation  and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies 
in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites  the company  along with many other entities  has been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs 
in addition  the company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
adequate reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman s policies as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
because of expected sharing of costs  the availability of legal defenses  and the company s preliminary assessment of actions that may be required  it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters  individually or in the aggregate  will be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to remediation activities  the company establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which was effective for the company on december  fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the interpretation also clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation caro refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company performed a thorough examination of various asset categories 
although it may have caros at certain of its facilities  including  but not limited to  the potential for asbestos abatement activities  the company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos 
the company continues to monitor these conditional obligations  as well as any new ones that may develop  and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs 
the recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately percent of the total environmental reserve at december  currently  the company s environmental assets are expected to be no longer useable at different times over the next years 
if the company were to invest in numerous new environmental assets  or  these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the company anticipated they would  the amortization on them would increase  and could have a material negative impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote  and does not anticipate  based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation  that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary 
inflation in recent years  general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on eastman s costs 
the cost of raw materials is generally based on market price  although derivative financial instruments were utilized  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market price fluctuations

 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter 
the statement adopts the international accounting standards board s view related to inventories that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred 
additionally  the statement clarifies the meaning of the term normal capacity 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company has evaluated the effect of sfas no 
and determined that it does not materially impact its consolidated financial position  liquidity  or results from operations 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all companies that award their employees stock based compensation to recognize these transactions in their financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this differs from the requirements of sfas no 
which permitted the option of adopting sfas no 
and reflecting these transactions in the financial statements or the continued application of apb opinion no 
requiring only pro forma disclosure of the effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if sfas no 
had been adopted 
through the end of  the company has elected to continue the application of apb opinion no 
with the pro forma disclosure required for sfas no 
however  the company is required to implement the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january  sfas no 
r requires the company  as of the required effective date of application  to implement the standard using a modified version of prospective application 
under this method  compensation expense is recognized for the following the portion of outstanding awards at the effective date of implementation for which the requisite employee service has not yet been rendered  based upon the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosure purposes  and all new awards  modified awards  repurchased awards  or cancelled awards after the effective date of implementation 
under previous reporting guidance  the following types of share based compensation awards have been recorded in the financial statements unrestricted common stock awards  restricted common stock awards  stock appreciation rights payable in cash and long term performance awards payable in the form of shares of common stock or cash 
the implementation of sfas no 
r includes the additional requirement to recognize compensation expense of stock option awards in the financial statements 
the outstanding quantity and value of existing stock option awards at december  for which the requisite service period has not been provided and for which compensation expense will be recognized in the financial statements after the effective date of application total  options and approximately million over three years 
the company did not modify any awards granted prior to january  to affect early vesting which would have eliminated the required service period to be provided after the effective date of application and eliminated recognition of compensation expense related thereto 
further  there have not been any changes in the quantity or type of share based payment awards solely due to the implementation of sfas no 
r 
the determination of the grant date fair value of share based compensation awards is based upon observable prices of financial equity instruments actively traded in open markets or  if not available  as in the case of the company s stock option awards and stock appreciation rights awards  an option pricing financial model should be used to estimate the fair value of the award 
eastman has relied upon the use of the black scholes merton model to determine the value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights under sfas no 
and will continue to do so under sfas no 
r 
as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  the use of any financial model may require the use of highly subjective input assumptions that may materially affect the fair value estimate 
refer to this footnote to review these assumptions for  and all share based employee compensation expense will be reflected in the earnings statement within the selling  general and administrative expense line item with an offset to paid in capital or non current liabilities in the statement of financial position dependent upon classification as a liability award or equity award 
awards classified as liabilities require the use of cash or other assets to effect payment while equity awards reflect payment through stock issuances 
the federal income tax and state income tax consequences of recognition for share based compensation are reflected in the earnings statement as a credit to current period income tax expense with an offset in the statement of financial position as deferred income taxes in the other non current assets line item 
additionally  sfas no 
r requires that cash inflows related to the realized tax benefits in excess of the amount recorded in the financial statements be recognized in the statement of cash flows as a cash inflow from financing and a cash outflow from operating activities 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook for  the company expects that the volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and that the company will continue to pursue pricing strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit  strong volumes will be maintained due to continued economic strength  continued substitution of eastman products for other materials  and new applications for existing products  that pension and other post employment benefit expenses will be similar to levels  to contribute approximately million to the company s us defined benefit pension plans  net interest expense to decrease compared with primarily as a result of anticipated lower average borrowings  increased capitalized interest and higher interest income  the effective tax rate to be approximately percent  to continue to evaluate its portfolio  which could lead to further restructuring  divestiture  or consolidation of product lines as it continues to focus on profitability  capital expenditures to increase to up to million and exceed estimated depreciation and amortization of approximately million  in  the company plans to complete construction of the new pet facility in south carolina  utilizing integrex technology  and pursue a copolyester intermediates expansion and other targeted growth initiatives  and that priorities for use of available cash will be to pay the quarterly cash dividend and fund targeted growth initiatives and defined benefit pension plans 
see forward looking statements and risk factors below 
forward looking statements and risk factors the expectations under outlook and certain other statements in this annual report on form k may be forward looking in nature as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the company from time to time may relate to  among other things  such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization  anticipated capital spending  expected depreciation and amortization  environmental matters  legal proceedings  exposure to  and effects of hedging of  raw material and energy costs and foreign currencies  global and regional economic  political  and business conditions  competition  growth opportunities  supply and demand  volume  price  cost  margin  and sales  earnings  cash flow  dividends and other expected financial conditions  expectations  strategies  and plans for individual assets and products  businesses  segments and divisions as well as for the whole of eastman chemical company  cash requirements and uses of available cash  financing plans  pension expenses and funding  credit ratings  anticipated restructuring  divestiture  and consolidation activities  cost reduction and control efforts and targets  integration of acquired businesses  development  production  commercialization and acceptance of new products  services and technologies and related costs  asset  business and product portfolio changes  and expected tax rates and net interest costs 
eastman logo management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements the company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials for its operations and utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  natural disasters  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business  or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  could affect availability and costs of raw materials 
while temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur  these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements 
however  their continuous availability and price are impacted by natural disasters  plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand  domestic and world market and political conditions  changes in government regulation  and war or other outbreak of hostilities 
eastman s operations or products may  at times  be adversely affected by these factors 
the company s competitive position in the markets in which it participates is  in part  subject to external factors in addition to those that the company can impact 
natural disasters  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business  or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  could negatively impact the company s competitive position and its ability to maintain market share

eastman logo item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations 
to mitigate the company s exposure to these market risks  eastman has established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis  which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and or commodity prices 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements 
currently  these borrowings are predominately us dollar denominated 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
in  for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  the company changed to a one percent absolute shift in interest rates from a percent relative shift in interest rates which was used in for and  the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of percent were approximately million and million  respectively 
this exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates 
the company s operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business 
in order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts or currency options 
for  the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates 
for  the market risks associated with forward exchange contracts utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model and a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency hedged by the company were approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   the company s outstanding borrowings denominated in foreign currencies were immaterial 
further adverse movements in foreign currencies would create losses in fair value  however  such losses would not be linear to that disclosed above 
this exposure  which is primarily related to foreign currency options purchased by the company to manage fluctuations in foreign currencies  is limited to the dollar value of option premiums payable by the company for the related financial instruments 
furthermore  since the company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy 
to mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities  principally propane and natural gas  the company enters into forwards and options contracts 
for and  the market risks associated with options and swaps for feedstock and natural gas assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent were million and million  respectively  and an additional million for each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter for both periods
