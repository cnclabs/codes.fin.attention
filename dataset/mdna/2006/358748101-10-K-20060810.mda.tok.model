corporate overview during the last week of fiscal year  the company moved its end of the week from sunday to tuesday 
the change was designed to facilitate operational efficiencies by moving end of week administrative duties away from weekends when sales volumes are normally much higher 
as a result  fiscal year ended on tuesday  may  it includes weeks plus two days 
it compares with the weeks ended on sunday  may   which constituted fiscal year  and the weeks ended on sunday  may   which constituted fiscal year operations consist of two reportable segments within the family dining sector of the restaurant industry 
as of may   big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants were in operation 
the company has a development agreement allowing it to open additional golden corral restaurants through december  four new golden corrals opened during fiscal year  however  no new restaurants have opened thus far in calendar year and current plans call for only two new golden corral restaurants in fiscal year the scale back in construction was initiated to strengthen the balance sheet by neutralizing debt while enabling operations to focus on rebuilding disappointing sales volumes in existing golden corral restaurants

net earnings for fiscal year were  or diluted earnings per share eps of  well below expectation after achieving record net earnings in fiscal years and net earnings for fiscal year were  or diluted eps of

the life insurance benefit that was received in fiscal year resulted from filing death claims on several life insurance policies owned by the company that insured the life of jack c 
maier  chairman of the board and formerly president and chief executive officer  who died in february the non taxable  benefit was derived principally from subtracting the cash surrender value of the policies that was previously recorded in the balance sheet as net cash surrender value life insurance policies from the aggregate proceeds which amounted to  net of  paid to another beneficiary

golden corral same store sales declined percent in fiscal year  marking the second consecutive year and eleven consecutive quarters of same store sales declines 
golden corral total sales increased percent  exceeding  the result of more restaurants in operation 

table of contents results of operation sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants 
big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators and the sale of big boy s signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases 
changes in sales also occur when new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed

year fiscal year fiscal year fiscal marked the ninth consecutive year that big boy same store sales increases have been achieved 
higher average guest checks driven by menu price increases were enough to offset lower customer counts 
same store customer counts in fiscal year were 
percent lower than fiscal year same store customer counts in fiscal year were percent lower than fiscal year continued steep gasoline prices throughout the last two fiscal years are believed to be one cause of the lower customer counts  as the higher cost to fill up a tank leaves many consumers with less money available to spend on a restaurant meal 
the same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively  during the third quarters of fiscal years  and the first quarters of fiscal years  fiscal and fiscal included average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
another price increase will be implemented in late summer the remainder of the big boy sales increases was achieved on the combination of more restaurants in operation and higher wholesale sales 
the company operated big boy restaurants as of may  this count includes a brand new big boy that opened in february and one that re opened in august following its reconstruction 
it had been temporarily closed since may no other new big boy restaurants have opened during the last twelve months 
one older  low volume big boy restaurant ceased operations in november during the latter half of calendar year  two existing big boy restaurants will be relocated to better sites within the same market areas 
little or no interruption of sales is expected to result from these relocations 
the significant increase in wholesale sales during fiscal year is attributed to a licensed operator of sixteen big boy restaurants in the toledo  ohio market that began purchasing food from the company s commissary 
such sales continued during fiscal year 
table of contents golden corral sales increases are due entirely to more restaurants in operation fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year in operation at beginning of year opened during the year in operation at end of year total sales weeks during year no golden corral restaurants were under construction as of may  two golden corral restaurants are scheduled to open in fiscal year following general industry practice  the same store sales comparisons in the table that follows include only those restaurants that were open for five full fiscal quarters prior to the start of the comparison periods 
this removes possible misleading numbers that can be caused by the great influx of customers during the first several months of operation  sometimes called the honeymoon period of a new restaurant 
using this formula  of the restaurants were included in the annualized fiscal year same store sales calculation 
the quarterly calculations for fiscal year included   and stores  respectively  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters

year fiscal fiscal fiscal year marked the second consecutive year and included the eleventh consecutive quarter of same store sales declines 
same store customer counts declined percent in fiscal year  which followed a percent decline in fiscal year although still a disappointment  management is encouraged by the significant reduction in the rate of decline in same store sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  when customer counts were down only and percent  respectively 
the improvement is a clear signal that certain strategies designed to grow sales are working  especially the marketing campaign everyone deserves a good meal 
every day 
the campaign focuses on a different dinner theme each night of the week 
the variety theme has resonated well with customers and has given them a reason to visit more often 
golden corral menu prices were increased 
percent in february  percent in may  percent in may and percent in november gross profit gross profit for the big boy segment includes commissary operations 
gross profit differs from restaurant level profit disclosed in note g segment information as advertising expense is charged against restaurant level profit

table of contents the operating percentages shown in the following table are percentages of total sales  including big boy wholesale sales 
the table supplements the discussion that follows which addresses cost of sales for both the big boy and golden corral reporting segments  including food cost  payroll and other operating costs 
total bb gc total bb gc total bb gc sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit food and paper cost percentages declined in fiscal year for both big boy and golden corral 
the improvement is largely due to favorable beef and poultry prices 
the cost of select top butts used by golden corral was lower than last year through much of the year 
an abundant supply of feeder cattle in the nation s herd should keep beef costs stable through much of fiscal year however  beef can be a highly volatile market  as import and export restrictions can cause wide fluctuations in cost 
the improved percentages in fiscal year reversed the results of fiscal year when commodity costs had escalated for beef  dairy and pork 
the food and paper cost percentages for the golden corral segment are much higher than the big boy segment because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral concept  as well as its use of steak as a featured item on the buffet 
the effect of changing commodity prices is actively managed with changes to the big boy menu mix and effective selection of items served on the golden corral food bar 
management s vigorous concentration to contain payroll and payroll related costs is reflected by the improved percentages shown in the above table 
although there is no seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  hours worked are managed closely according to restaurant sales patterns 
there has been no appreciable change in average hourly pay rates over the three year period 
although congressional efforts continually mount to raise the federal minimum wage  the company believes minimum wage legislation at the state level poses a greater risk 
when  and if  such legislation is enacted  the company will counter the effects with higher menu prices  together with tighter payroll standards and a reduction in the number of hours that employees would be permitted to work 
other chain restaurant operators would likely respond with similar measures 
new overtime rules initiated by the us department of labor went into effect in august the new rules had a negligible impact on the company 
payroll related costs include statutory provisions for social security  unemployment and workers compensation  along with voluntary benefits provided by the company such as defined benefit pension plans and medical insurance 
the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
management historically reviewed self insured claims experience each quarter  with a comprehensive review performed during the first quarter of each year 
at that time the reserves were usually reduced to more closely reflect claims experience 
the company has been able to significantly reduce its reserves in recent years because the combination of active management of claims and post accident drug testing has produced improved claims experience by lowering both the number of claims and the average cost per claim 
because of these trends  the company undertook a comprehensive review of claims experience during fiscal year and determined that comprehensive reviews were warranted each quarter beginning in the third quarter of fiscal with adjustments to the reserves recorded as needed 
favorable adjustments were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and beginning in fiscal year  a lower rate as a percentage of payroll was used to accrue initial self insurance reserves  which should reduce the size of future quarterly adjustments 
although pension costs have remained fairly steady over the past three years  the costs are at historically high levels after many years of very reasonable costs 
investment returns on equity investments held by the trust that governs 
table of contents the defined benefit pension plans can and do affect the costs to a great extent 
net periodic pension cost computed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in all three years 
however  the assumption will be lowered to percent to determine pension costs for fiscal year the weighted average discount rate mirrors movement in the underlying markets and is considered a snapshot rate reflecting current market conditions 
the rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension costs was reduced to percent for fiscal year  down from percent used in fiscal years and the rate for fiscal will be percent 
the rate of compensation increase for pension costs was reduced to percent in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal years and it will remain at percent for fiscal year cash contributions made by the company to these plans were   and  respectively  during fiscal years  and medical insurance premiums continue to escalate 
premiums in fiscal year were approximately percent higher than fiscal year  which was percent higher than fiscal year the company typically absorbs percent of premium costs  sharing percent with covered employees 
other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  opening costs and many other restaurant operating expenses 
most of these expenses tend to be fixed  therefore  same store sales decreases cause these costs to be a higher percentage of sales  as conspicuously indicated in the above table for golden corral 
opening costs also have a significant impact on the percentages as well 
opening cost charges for big boy restaurants for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs should be much lower in fiscal year as only two new restaurants are expected to open 
other operating costs in fiscal year were adversely impacted by a  charge to correct the company s accounting for leases  which was conformed to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  including any option periods considered to be part of the lease term  as lease terms are defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases  as amended 
sfas also defines the term of the lease as including the period of time when no rent is paid to the landlord  often referred to as a rent holiday  that generally occurs while a restaurant is being built on leased land 
a total of  of under accrued rent holidays was capitalized during fiscal year in conforming the recognition of rent to sfas the company ceased capitalizing rent holidays effective with the fiscal quarter that began september  pursuant to the issuance of a staff position promulgated by the financial accounting standards board that prohibited the capitalization of such costs 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while franchise fees and other revenue is added to it 
gains and losses on sale of real property  if any  are then respectively added or subtracted 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs 
spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate with higher sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and the higher amounts in fiscal years and compared with fiscal year include higher costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act and increased litigation costs 
revenue from franchise fees is based on sales of big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales generated by the licensed restaurants and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of may   big boy restaurants licensed to other operators were paying franchise fees to the company 
there were and such restaurants respectively paying fees to the company as of may  and may  other revenue also includes certain other fees from licensed restaurants along with miscellaneous rent and investment income 

table of contents gains and losses on sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that often arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life 
abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
the amount reported on the line gain on sale of assets in fiscal year resulted principally from a gain in connection with an eminent domain proceeding 
amounts reported for fiscal year and fiscal year primarily represent gains from the sale of undeveloped land 
no impairments of assets were recorded during any of the three years in the period ended may  other expense income interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the  increase in fiscal year over fiscal year was caused by the combination of higher debt levels for most of the year  higher interest rates and lower levels of capitalized interest 
the retirement of  of outstanding debt in march  which was provided from life insurance benefits  supplied some relief in interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year without the benefit of the  debt retirement in march  interest expense for fiscal year would have been at least  higher 
higher interest rates have been experienced in fiscal year on funds borrowed under the terms of a construction draw facility  before conversion into term loans 
in addition  interest expense in fiscal year includes interest recognized in connection with payments pursuant to a deferred compensation agreement 
in addition to interest expense  the  non taxable life insurance benefit in fiscal year was classified as other expense income  and is not included in the determination of operating profit 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year  and percent in fiscal year the fiscal income tax expense percentage was favorably affected by the  gain from non taxable life insurance benefit 
the effective rate for fiscal would have been percent without the advantage of the non taxable life insurance benefit 
the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips 
to a lesser degree  the company also uses the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc  the expiration of which on december  is reflected in the tax rate for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources sources of funds sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in cash or are settled by debit or credit cards 
net earnings plus depreciation provide the primary source of cash provided by operating activities 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when employees exercise stock options and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and dividends 
working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations  and credit lines are readily available  the use of this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table 

table of contents aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of may  payments due by period in thousands more than years total year year year year year long term debt       rent due under capital lease obligations   rent due under operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligations  total contractual cash obligations     not included in the table is a contingent liability for the performance of a ground lease that has been assigned to a third party 
the annual obligation of the lease approximates through should the third party default  the company has the right to re assign the lease

primarily consists of commitments for capital projects plus certain food and beverage items 
deferred compensation liability 
the working capital deficit was  as of may  the deficit was  as of may  the reduction in the working capital deficit reflects lower accounts payable for construction activity  due to the scale back in golden corral expansion that has been initiated to strengthen the balance sheet 
as of may    remains available to be borrowed under the terms of a construction draw credit facility  which expires september  additionally  a  working capital revolving line of credit currently unused is readily available through september   if needed 
operating activities operating cash flows were  in fiscal year   lower than fiscal year and  below fiscal year the decreases are primarily attributable to normal changes in assets and liabilities 
management believes a better  more reliable gauge to measure cash flows from the operation of the business is to use the simple method of net earnings plus depreciation and losses minus any gains  the primary benefit of which is to eliminate changes in accounts payable due to payables for construction related costs 
the result of this method is reflected as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year life insurance benefit excluded and  in fiscal year investing activities capital spending is the principal component of investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal year  a decrease of  from fiscal year that is principally the result of scaled back golden corral construction 
this year s capital spending includes  for golden corral restaurants and  for big boy restaurants 
these capital expenditures consisted of new restaurant construction  site acquisitions  remodeling costs  routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 

table of contents proceeds from dispositions of property were much higher in fiscal year  which was the result of selling two properties that the company had originally intended to develop that ultimately proved to be not viable  along with proceeds from an eminent domain proceeding 
investing activities for fiscal year included the receipt of claims for life insurance benefits totaling  net of  paid to another beneficiary  associated with the death of the company s chairman of the board in february investing activities for fiscal included the recovery of  received in settlement of certain litigation relating to defective construction of a golden corral restaurant 
the settlement was with the architect and the architect s structural engineering consultant 
receipt of the settlement funds was sufficient to recover all construction costs incurred  including the cost to raze the defective building 
the company continues to vigorously prosecute its claim exceeding  against the general contractor that built the building 
financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal year scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal year payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations in fiscal year included  that was paid with the life insurance proceeds discussed above under investing activities 
regular quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled  in fiscal year as the company expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends  the board of directors declared another 
per share dividend on june  during fiscal year  employees acquired nearly  shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options  yielding proceeds to the company of approximately  as of may    shares granted under the company s two stock option plans remain outstanding  including  fully vested shares at a weighted average price per share of 
as of may    shares remained available to be granted under these plans 
other information the company reached a new development agreement with golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor in july under the new agreement  golden corrals were added to the development schedule  bringing the total to restaurants to be in operation by december  the remaining development schedule calls for five restaurants to be opened in each of the calendar years    and  with the final four to be built in calendar year however  with the concurrence of the franchisor  it now appears likely that only one golden corral restaurant will open in calendar year with one more to open before the end of fiscal year as of may   golden corral restaurants were in operation and no new restaurant construction was underway 
the scale back in golden corral construction was initiated in order to use cash flow and credit facilities in a debt neutral manner  thus strengthening the balance sheet while allowing operations to focus on re building same store sales 
five golden corral restaurants were remodeled in fiscal year at an average approximate cost of  each 
plans call for six golden corral restaurants to be remodeled in fiscal two big boy restaurants were under construction as of may   both of which are replacement buildings of existing operations on superior sites within the same market areas 
as of may   the estimated cost remaining to complete these projects was  approximately one fifth of the company s big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year at an average cost of  per restaurant 
in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  including land and land improvements  the cash required to build and equip each new restaurant currently ranges from  to  for a golden corral  and from  to  for a big boy 
the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
it is the company s policy to own the land on which it builds new restaurants  however  it is becoming more frequently necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
eight of the golden corral restaurants now in operation have been built on leased land 
a big boy restaurant that opened in february was also built on leased land and a big boy restaurant is currently under construction on leased land 
all of these leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
as of may  the company occupied restaurants pursuant to leases  six of which are capital leases under the provisions of sfas 
table of contents normal lease expirations for three of the leased restaurants were reached during fiscal year  which are continuing to be occupied on a month to month basis pending the execution of the company s right to purchase the properties from the landlord 
the purchase price for the three properties has yet to be determined  but is not expected to exceed  application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes the following to be its critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  the company reviews claims valued by its third party administrator tpa and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  the company reviews it in light of past history of claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections 
pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
an informal committee consisting of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
the plan assets are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee looks at the target asset allocation of plan assets and determines the expected return on each asset class 
the expected returns for each asset class are combined and rounded to the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected return on assets 
the committee has determined that the expected rate of return will be lowered to percent for fiscal year the company had used an percent expected long term rate of return on plan assets for many years 
the committee determines the discount rate by looking at the projected future benefit payments and matching those to spot rates based on yields of high grade corporate bonds 
a single discount rate is chosen  rounded to the nearest basis points  that produces the same present value as the various spot rates 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment typically approximate percent of the company s total assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
management considers a history of cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
carrying values of property and equipment are accordingly tested for impairment each 
table of contents quarter 
in addition  carrying values are also reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which carrying values exceed estimated realizable values 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may impact operating performance  which affect cash flow 
estimated realizable values are provided by real estate brokers and or the company s past experience in disposing of property 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor performance 
the final impairment amount can be significantly different from the initial charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of realizable values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
any cash equivalents maintained by the company have original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not use foreign currency 
big boy restaurants utilize centralized purchasing and food preparation through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
the company believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and ultimately results in lower food and supply costs 
the commissary operation does not supply golden corral restaurants 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside the company s control  including import and export restrictions  supply versus demand  production and the impact of weather on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
these contracts are normally for periods of one year or less but may have longer terms if favorable long term pricing becomes available 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers  which mitigates the company s overall commodity cost risk 
quality  timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing 
except for items such as fresh produce and dairy products that are purchased from any number of local suppliers  the company currently purchases substantially all food  beverage and other menu items for use in its golden corral restaurants from the same approved vendor that golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor uses for its operations 
deliveries are made two or three times per week 
other vendors are available to provide products that meet the franchisor s specifications at comparable prices should the company wish or need to make a change
