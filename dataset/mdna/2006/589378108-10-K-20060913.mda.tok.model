overview we design  manufacture and market high performance embedded  real time digital signal and image processing solutions 
our solutions play a critical role in a wide range of applications  transforming sensor data to information for analysis and interpretation 
in military reconnaissance and surveillance platforms our systems process real time radar  sonar  and signals intelligence data 
our systems are also used in state of the art medical diagnostic imaging devices including mri  pet  and digital x ray  and in semiconductor imaging applications including photomask generation and wafer inspection 
we provide advanced d image processing and visualization software and optimized systems to diverse end markets including life sciences  geosciences  and simulation 
we also provide radio frequency rf products for enhanced communications capabilities in military and commercial applications 
we are an oem supplier to our commercial markets and conduct business with our defense customers via commercial off the shelf cots distribution  which means that product requests by customers are a primary driver of revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
customers specify delivery date requirements that coincide with their need for our product 
because these customers may use our products in connection with a variety of defense programs or other projects with different sizes and durations  a customer s orders for one quarter generally do not indicate a trend for future orders by that customer 
additionally  order patterns of one customer do not necessarily correlate with the order patterns of another customer and  therefore  we generally cannot identify sequential quarterly trends  even within our business units 
during fiscal year  revenues decreased by million compared to fiscal year ended june   primarily as a result of a million decrease in revenues from our defense business unit defense and million decrease in revenues from our advanced solutions business unit advanced solutions offset by a million increase from our commercial imaging and visualization business unit civ and a million increase of our modular product and services business unit mps 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues 
table of contents decreased from during fiscal year to during fiscal year primarily due to a shift within our defense business to lower margin fully configured and racked systems from historical higher margin multi computer board sets  a greater percentage of software and professional services sale  which carry a lower margin than our defense products  a significant third quarter inventory write off and increased warranty provisions 
operating expenses increased by million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to several factors 
first  we incurred million of incremental operating expenses associated with our acquisitions of echotek corporation and sohard ag  which were completed in the first quarter of fiscal year  and million of incremental operating expenses associated with the acquisition of momentum computer  inc  which was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year second  research and development expenses unrelated to these acquisitions increased by million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year third  we incurred million of compensation costs classified as operating expenses associated with the share based payments provided to our employees 
in prior periods  this compensation expense was reported on a pro forma basis in the financial statement footnotes  however  upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas r  share based payment  on july   these costs are now expensed in the consolidated statements of operations 
in response to lower than expected demand in certain sectors of our business  as well as the need to maintain a competitive cost structure and integrate our previous acquisitions  we incurred a million charge  net of reversals  related to our restructuring plan in order to prospectively save approximately million annually based on the reduction in workforce 
we believe the restructuring was necessary given the state of our markets and given that funding for several defense programs have been delayed and our transition to computing for d imaging in the life sciences segment has delayed some revenue 
we believe that this workforce reduction will enable us to remain competitive in the market and improve our long term results 
on september   we acquired a voting interest in momentum computer  inc mci  a manufacturer and developer of high performance embedded processor and i o boards  for million  which was recorded at that time as an investment in an unconsolidated entity 
in december  we acquired the remaining voting interest in mci in a separately negotiated transaction  paying million in cash and agreeing to pay up to million of additional cash consideration if specified operating income and revenue targets are achieved by mci over the months following the closing 
any such additional payments will be recorded as additional purchase price and goodwill if and when incurred 
as of june  we have not made any additional payments and do not expect to make any such payments in the future 
the purchase price for the acquisition of mci was million  consisting of cash payments of million and transaction costs of million directly related to the acquisition 
the acquisition of mci expanded the breadth our product offerings across all of our markets 
the results of mci s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since december  from september  to december   we recorded our pro rata share of mci s net operating results under the equity method of accounting 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the former shareholders of tgs group that finalized the purchase price for the fiscal year acquisition and  as a result  we paid million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock  representing the final payment of the purchase price 
the total purchase price of million for the acquisition of tgs group consisted of total cash payments of million   shares of our common stock valued at million  and million of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition 
on july   we acquired sohard ag for million  consisting of cash payments of million and transaction costs of million directly related to the acquisition 
sohard is a market leader in the development of advanced software solutions for medical imaging systems  hardware and firmware for commercial embedded systems and software intelligence applications delivered via professional services 
sohard is headquartered in fuerth  germany 
the results of sohard s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 

table of contents on august   we purchased echotek corporation for million  consisting of cash payments of million   shares of mercury common stock valued at million and transaction costs of million directly related to the acquisition 
based in huntsville  alabama  echotek is a market leader in the development of data acquisition products 
the results of echotek s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
going forward  business and market uncertainties may affect future results 
for a discussion of key factors that could impact the future and must be managed by us  please refer to the discussion below 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  litigation  and the valuation of inventory  long lived assets  goodwill  and income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in our estimates from period to period  such as changes in assumptions underlying our estimates  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  using the ends of the range of reasonably possible amounts that we determined in formulating our estimate  rather than the reported estimate  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  during the past three fiscal years  such changes in our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable and inventory valuation and to warranty cost accruals  have not had a material impact on our overall financial performance or on any individual line item in our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
certain contracts with customers require us to perform tests of our products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with our published product specifications and  on occasion  with additional customer requested specifications 
in these cases  we conduct such tests and  if they are completed successfully  include a written confirmation with each order shipped 
as a result  at the time of each product shipment  we believe that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of non acceptance by the customer 
in the limited instance that customer payment is conditioned upon final acceptance testing by the customer at its own facility  we do not recognize any revenue until the final acceptance testing has been completed and written confirmation from the customer has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  we defer the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price that is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a 
table of contents standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement  and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially within our control 
fair value is generally limited to the price charged when the same or similar element is sold separately or  if applicable  the stated substantive renewal rate in the agreement 
installation of our products requires insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the products and may be performed by our customers or other vendors 
if an order includes installation or training services that are undelivered at the time of product shipment  we defer revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training obligations until such time as the services have been provided 
we determine these fair values based on the price typically charged to our customers who purchase these services separately 
for transactions involving the licensing of standalone software products and of software that is not incidental to the product  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the software has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our standalone software products are generally not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware system and do not require installation by us or significant modification or customization of the software 
the fair value of maintenance agreements related to standalone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement 
we also engage in long term contracts for the development  production and services activities which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally for fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method or  for certain short term contracts  by the completed contract method 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the risk to us on a fixed price contract is that if estimates to complete the contract change from one period to the next  profit levels will vary from period to period 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which would directly affect operating income 
for all types of contracts  the company recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in revenue and cost of revenue 
the use of contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenues and costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials  and the availability of subcontractor services and materials 
our estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program managers and other personnel  who review each long term contract monthly to assess the contract s schedule  performance  technical matters and estimated cost at completion 
changes in estimates are applied on a retrospective basis  that is to say when adjustments in estimated contract costs are identified  such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
with very limited exceptions  we do not provide our customers with rights of product return  other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment 
currently  for the few commercial products that have rights of product return  we defer revenue until the return period ends due to the limited sales and returns history related to these products 

table of contents revenue from product royalties are recognized upon receipt of payment unless another reasonable and reliable method of recognition is more appropriate 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value  and consists of materials  labor and overhead 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net realizable value 
we reduce the value of reported inventory for excess and obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand and non cancelable on order inventory in excess of estimated usage 
the excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets result from our various business acquisitions see note m to the consolidated financial statements and certain licensed technologies  and consist of identifiable intangible assets  including completed technology  licensing agreements  customer backlog and customer relationships 
acquired intangible assets are reported at cost  net of accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to six years 
goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase 
goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment and acquired intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
income tax assets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
except for deferred tax assets acquired in the tgs group acquisition  operating losses associated with sohard  and utilization of certain state research and development credit carryforwards  we believe that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our expectations of future income 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against the net amount of the tgs group deferred tax assets  opening losses associated with sohard  and utilization of certain state research and development credit carryforwards 
warranty accrual our product sales generally include a or month hardware warranty  with the exception of product sales in the mps segment  which generally include a three year hardware warranty 
at time of product shipment  we accrue for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products 
estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar products 

table of contents stock based compensation we have several stock based employee compensation plans 
on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method  which results in the provisions of sfas r only being applied to the consolidated financial statements on a going forward basis that is  the prior period results were not restated 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period 
further  we have elected under sfas r to recognize the fair value of awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis 
previously  we had followed accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements 
our determination of fair value of stock based payment awards is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of the stock based award

table of contents fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenues as a of total net revenue as a of total net revenue change change defense dbu commercial imaging and visualization civ advanced solutions asbu modular products and services mps total revenues total revenues decreased from million during fiscal year to million during fiscal year international revenues represented approximately and of total revenues during fiscal years and  respectively 
defense revenues decreased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease was primarily related to a million decrease in radar applications  a million decrease in shipments serving signal intelligence applications and a million decrease in defense technology and applications 
contributing to these decreases in radar application and signal intelligence applications included a reprioritizing of funding by the federal government  loss of the acs program and the impact of the berry amendment which has caused several orders to slip out of fiscal year the decrease in defense revenues was partially offset by a million increase in sales of radio frequency products and a million increase resulting from the acquisition of echotek corporation 
we did record design wins in fiscal year in various defense market segments  however  given the lengthy development and evaluation phases  significant revenues will not be realized for a few years from these design wins 
also we see significant potential for our synthetic vision technology within various government agencies 
in fiscal year  we will be exploring various ways to optimize the return on this development 
civ revenues increased million or from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of revenues of million associated with the acquisition of sohard  which was completed in the first quarter of  and a million increase in revenues related to our d image processing and visualization software applications offset by an expected decline in most of our legacy business lines including mri  digital x ray  computed tomography ct and pet 
we are expecting that our d business with ge healthcare  motorola gmbh and philips medical systems will continue to decrease significantly over the next months as these customers transition to new platforms and new component manufacturers 
we are starting to build a portfolio of new d image processing and visualization software applications for which we perceive significant customer interest in the medical and oil and gas discovery industries  however  due to the slow adoption rate of d applications by the marketplace  these are not ramping up quickly enough to offset the decline in our existing programs 
we are projecting modest growth in revenues in fiscal year for civ 
our optimism is based on new life sciences customer wins in fiscal year across the multiple segments we serve 
advanced solutions revenues decreased million or from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in revenues was primarily related to a million decrease in shipments of semiconductor imaging boards for developing and testing new semiconductors 
shipments of semiconductor imaging boards represented and of advanced solutions revenues for the year ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in semiconductor sales was partially offset by an approximately million increase in sales of our ensemble application platform system to several large telecommunication customers 
while some business was lost in the semiconductor field to customer in house designs in fiscal year  we expect that the new 
table of contents mercury design win with the same customer will partially offset the lost revenue when it goes into production 
as the result of this and other major design wins  one based on the cell be processor  we expect significant asbu revenue growth in fiscal year mps revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june  mps was formed as a result of the mci acquisition on december   thus there were only months of revenues included in our consolidated financial statements during the comparable period in fiscal year on an annualized basis mps has seen an increase in revenue due to a large  million  defense related order shipped in fiscal year plus growing demand for its new high performance custom and off the shelf products 
gross profit gross profit was for fiscal year  a decrease of basis points from the gross profit achieved in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a shift within our defense business to lower margin fully configured and racked systems from historical higher margin multi computer board sets  a greater percentage of newer business technologies which carry a lower margin than our defense products  a significant third quarter inventory write off of approximately million and increased warranty provisions 
the inventory write off was the result of several factors including a decline in revenues of the defense business and shifts in technology that resulted in the inventory becoming obsolete 
the warranty provision increased significantly during the fiscal year primarily due to two commitments made with customers to perform on site warranty work related to boards purchased from our contract manufacturers and other third party suppliers 
these agreements resulted in an incremental warranty provision of approximately million during fiscal year selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of million of expenses related to stock based compensation recorded as a result of adopting sfas r and a million of incremental expenses relating to the operations of the sohard  echotek and mci acquisitions  offset by a decrease in compensation expense due to a decrease in headcount of employees unrelated to our recent acquisitions 
also impacting the increase was million of expenses related to our on going enterprise resource procurement erp system project 
in july  we began an erp system upgrade to improve our erp system capabilities and processes 
during fiscal year million of costs were incurred on the erp system upgrade  of which million of erp costs were capitalized through june  research and development research and development expenses increased or million to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of a million of expenses related to stock based compensation recorded as a result of adopting sfas r  b million of incremental expenses relating to the operations of the sohard and echotek acquisitions and c million of expenses associated with a shift in contract mix and personnel allocation which resulted in fewer research and development employees working on customer contracts and spending more time on research and development initiatives 
one of the more significant research and development initiatives for fiscal year that will continue into fiscal year is our development efforts related to the cell be processor family of products which accounted for approximately million of the research and development expenses in fiscal year amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets increased or million to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in amortization expenses for fiscal year was primarily the result of amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired in the sohard and echotek acquisitions which were completed in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents restructuring expense in response to lower than expected demand in certain sectors of our business  as well as the need to maintain a competitive cost structure and integrate our previous acquisitions  we incurred million  net of reversals  related to our restructuring plan the plan during fiscal year the net expense related to the plan included million related to involuntary separation costs for employees and for other costs 
the restructuring charges are classified as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest income interest income for fiscal year increased by million to million compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily related to increased rates of return on our marketable securities  partially offset by lower levels of cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal year decreased by million to million compared to fiscal year the interest rates on our outstanding notes payable are fixed in nature  thus  the fluctuations in interest expense are primarily related to lower principal balances on the debt and the impact of non cash interest expense which relates to the amortization of our deferred financing costs 
other income expense  net other income expense for fiscal year decreased by million compared to fiscal year the changes in other income expense were primarily due to realized gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions and the impact of our deferred compensation plan see note q to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit provision we recorded an income tax benefit for income taxes of million in fiscal year reflecting a effective tax benefit rate  as compared to a effective tax provision rate for fiscal year our effective tax rate for fiscal year was lower than the us statutory tax rate of primarily due to the operating losses incurred in fiscal year offset by a valuation allowance recorded in fiscal year on the net amount of the tgs group deferred tax assets and the deferred tax assets related to the operating losses associated with sohard and utilization of certain state research and development credit carryforwards 
the fiscal year tax rate is less than the us statutory rate primarily due to an additional benefit attributable to research and development tax credits  tax exempt interest and the extraterritorial income eti benefit 
segment operating results results from operations of the defense segment decreased million to a loss of million as compared to income from operations of million for fiscal year the decrease operating results of the defense segment was primarily related to a a shift in product mix to lower margin products  b increased incremental operating expenses associated with the acquisition of echotek  c a significant third quarter inventory write off and d increased operating expenses  primarily associated with additional research and development  million of additional amortization associated with the intangibles acquired as a result of the echotek acquisition and a charge of million related to in process research and development 
results from operations of the civ segment decreased million to a loss of million as compared to income from operations of million for fiscal year the decrease operating results of the civ segment for was primarily related to operating losses incurred by our sohard subsidiary 
these increased operating expenses for fiscal year included a million of additional amortization associated with the intangibles acquired as a result of the sohard acquisition and a non recurring charge of million related to in process research and development and increased organic operating expenses  primarily associated with research and development related to the product family based on the cell be processor 

table of contents income from operations of the advanced solutions segment decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for fiscal year the decrease in income from operations of the advanced solutions segment was primarily a result of the decrease in revenues of million primarily related to semiconductor market applications and the impact of a significant discrete warranty obligation 
losses from operations of the mps segment were million for fiscal year mps was formed as a result of the mci acquisition on december   thus there were only months of operating results included in our consolidated financial statements during the comparable periods in fiscal year on an annualized basis mps has seen a decrease in operating losses due to a growing demand for its new high performance custom and off the shelf products

selling  general and administrative headcount increased by employees not as a result of our acquisitions 
research and development research and development expenses increased by  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an additional million of expenses relating to the research activities associated with the tgs group  arc and mci acquisitions  as well as an increase in prototype development expenses of approximately million and an increase in compensation expense from the increase in headcount of employees unrelated to our acquisitions 
research and development is important to our future success  and we expect that research and development expenses will increase in future periods 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets expense increased by  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets expense in fiscal year year was primarily due to a full year of amortization from intangible assets acquired in the tgs group and arc acquisitions  which were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and amortization of intangible assets acquired in the mci acquisition  which was completed on december  interest income interest income was million in fiscal year  up from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to higher rates of return and increased invested cash balances in  including million from convertible debt net proceeds raised in april interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal year  up million from million in fiscal year this increase was related to the increased interest expense associated with our million of convertible debt issued in april income tax provision our provision for income taxes was million during fiscal year  reflecting a tax rate  as compared to million during fiscal year  reflecting a tax rate

table of contents cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year primarily as a result of cash outlays for acquisitions  while cash and cash equivalents increased by from fiscal year to fiscal year  largely as a result higher net income 
during fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operations compared to million generated during fiscal year the million decrease in the amount of cash generated from operations was largely driven by lower comparative net income  a million decrease in deferred income taxes and a million decrease in accounts receivable due largely to the downturn in revenues 
the net loss was offset by several non cash expenses  including million of stock based compensation expense and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense due largely to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the sohard and echotek acquisitions 
our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability  the rate of collection of accounts receivable  our inventory turns and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 
during fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operations compared to million generated in fiscal year the million increase in the amount of cash generated from operations was primarily due to a million increase in net income  a million increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expenses and deferred income taxes 
these items increasing cash provided by operations were offset by several factors  including a million increase in the year over year change in working capital items other than cash as compared with the previous year 
during fiscal year  we used million of cash for investing activities compared with million generated from investing activities in fiscal year during fiscal year  our net sales of marketable securities were million  which were partially offset by the acquisition of businesses and purchases of property and equipment of million and million  respectively 
also impacting fiscal year investing cash flows was the purchase of certain licensed technologies for million

in fiscal year  financing activities provided cash of million  including million in net proceeds from a convertible debt offering  and did not include any stock repurchases during the year 
currently  our prime source of liquidity comes from existing cash and marketable securities and cash expected to be generated from operations 
our near term fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases  mortgage notes  an alliance purchase agreement and inventory purchase commitments  as well as interest payments on our long term debt 
we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements  we may need to access funds through bank loans  sales of securities or other 
table of contents means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to effectively operate our business 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
debt the terms of our mortgage note agreements contain certain covenants  which  among other provisions  require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
the mortgage note agreements also include significant prepayment penalties 
we were not in compliance with the consolidated interest expense to earnings before interest and taxes and consolidated indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization covenants as of june  this non compliance was largely due to the impact of the third and fourth quarter net losses 
on april   the company obtained a temporary waiver from the holders of the mortgage notes  effective through july  and later extended to july   for the company s non compliance with these covenants  after which time the company would be required to meet these covenants 
subsequent to the expiration of the temporary waiver  the company was not in compliance with the covenants 
accordingly  we have reclassified the mortgage notes from long term to current as of june  if a mutually agreeable amendment to the covenant cannot be reached or if an agreement is reached but the covenants are not attainable and the mortgage note holders were to exercise their rights  we would be required to repay the outstanding principal  accrued interest plus the prepayment penalty which as of june  was approximately

the notes may also be converted at the option of the holder if prior to may   the average trading price for the convertible senior notes is less than of the average conversion value for the convertible senior notes during any five consecutive trading day period 
the convertible notes mature on may  and bear interest at per year  payable semiannually in arrears in may and november 
the convertible notes are unsecured  rank equally in right of payment to our existing and future senior debt  and do not subject us to any financial covenants 
the holders may require us to repurchase the notes  in whole or in part  a on may   or  b upon a change in control  or c if our common stock is neither listed nor approved for trading on specified markets

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation presents a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while additional efforts will be necessary to measure and disclose this information  we do not expect the adoption of interpretation no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and the related fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditions asset retirement obligations 
the effective date of this fsp is the first reporting period after june  or the date of adoption of the law by the applicable eu member country 
we have evaluated whether the eu directive is applicable to both our foreign subsidiaries and to shipments abroad from our us subsidiaries 
we have assessed the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement and there was no material affect on our operating results

 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so 
retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used 
sfas s retrospective application requirement replaces apb opinion no 
s requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
under sfas  correction of an error in previously issued financial statements will continue to be accounted for by restating the prior period financial statements  and a change in accounting estimate will continue to be accounted for prospectively 
the requirements of sfas are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is allowed 
the company adopted sfas during fiscal this adoption had no impact on fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short term and long term marketable securities 
fixed rate debt obligations issued by us are generally not putable  with the exception of the convertible debt  and are not actively traded by us in the market 
therefore  we do not believe our exposure to interest rate risk is material for our fixed rate debt  with the exception of the convertible debt 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
since the convertible debt was out of the money at the end of fiscal year  it was treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on these bases  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of june  and  respectively 
foreign currency risk we operate primarily in the united states 
in fiscal years and  and of our revenues were billed in us dollars  respectively 
however  an increasing portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  japan  and france  where business is largely transacted in non us dollar currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in the exchange rates of these currencies 
local currencies are used as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france  germany  and japan 
consequently  changes in the exchange rates of the currencies may impact the translation of the foreign subsidiaries statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect our consolidated statement of operations 
the impact of the movements in foreign currency exchange rates has been immaterial for all periods 
we have not entered into any financial derivatives instruments that expose us to material market risk  including any instruments designed to hedge the impact of foreign currency exposures
