item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in this report 
third party reimbursement in the us  health care providers generally rely on third party payors  including private health insurance plans  federal medicare  state medicaid  and managed care organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures they perform 
third party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement these payors provide for services 
in general  reimbursement for newborn screening is included in the lump sum payment for the newborn s birth and hospitalization 
for this reason  we are not able to measure a reimbursement success rate for our screening products 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country or by regions within countries  and may include both private and government sponsored insurance 
customer service and support we provide a one year warranty on all medical device products 
we also sell extended service agreements on our medical device products 
service for our domestic customers is provided by a company owned service center that performs all service  repair  and calibration services 
service for our international customers is provided by a combination of company owned facilities and third party vendors on a contract basis 

table of contents manufacturing other companies manufacture a significant portion of the components used in our products  however  we perform final assembly  testing  and packaging of most of the devices ourselves to control quality and manufacturing efficiency 
we also use contract vendors to manufacture some of our disposable supply and medical device products 
we perform regular quality audits of these vendors 
we design  program  and produce our neometrics newborn screening data management system at our new york facility 
we purchase materials and components from qualified suppliers that are subject to our stringent quality specifications and inspections 
we conduct quality audits of our key suppliers  several of which are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of finished medical devices  or supplies for use with medical devices 
most of our purchased components are available from more than one supplier 
our manufacturing  service  and repair facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal  state  and foreign regulatory authorities 
our quality assurance system is subject to regulation by the fda and other state government agencies 
we are required to conduct our product design  testing  manufacturing  and control activities in conformance with the fda s quality system regulations and to maintain our documentation of these activities in a prescribed manner 
our san carlos  california manufacturing  service  and repair facility is registered and or licensed by the fda and the state of california 
we have passed all quality system regulations inspections of our facilities conducted by the fda and respective states 
in addition  our san carlos facility has received iso certification 
iso certification standards for quality operations have been developed to ensure that medical device companies know the standards of quality on a worldwide basis 
we have also received the ec certificate pursuant to the european union medical device directive eec  which allowed us to place a ce mark on our products after assembling appropriate documentation 
research and development we are committed to introducing new products and supporting current product offerings in our markets through a combination of internal as well as external efforts that are consistent with our corporate strategy 
internal product development capabilities 
we believe that product development capabilities are essential to provide our customers with new product offerings 
we plan to leverage our core technologies by introducing product line extensions as well as new product offerings 
partnerships that complement our expertise 
we continue to seek strategic partners in order to develop products that may not otherwise be available to us 
by taking advantage of our core competencies  we believe that we can bring products to market in an efficient manner  and leverage our distribution channels 
new opportunities through technology acquisition 
we continue to evaluate new and emerging technologies in order to identify new product opportunities for our customers 
with our knowledge of the newborn market we believe that we can effectively develop technologies into successful new products 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in  and million in proprietary rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret  and trademark laws 
at december   the company held us patents  which will expire at various times from to  and foreign patents  and had eight us and foreign patent applications pending 
our patents and patent applications address various aspects of our current products and those in development including  but not limited to  the earphones used with our algo screeners  and certain features of our neoblue phototherapy 
table of contents devices 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  and corporate partners  and seek to control access to our intellectual property  distribution channels  documentation  and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
the original patent for an algorithm for analyzing auditory brainstem responses  which we licensed on a nonexclusive basis from a third party and upon which we developed our automated auditory brainstem response technology  expired in late  and that subject matter is in the public domain 
with respect to our neoblue phototherapy devices  the basic concept of using blue lights for phototherapy is well established in the technical literature and is therefore not patentable 
however  we have several patents pending that pertain to some of the features in and designs of our neoblue phototherapy devices  and the design and manufacturing methods we use are proprietary to us 
we cannot be certain that the patent applications we have filed to protect the features of our products will be allowed  and if allowed will be enforceable  and if enforceable will deter others from using similar technologies 
we capitalize the cost of purchased technology and intellectual property  as well as certain costs incurred in obtaining patent rights  and amortize these costs over the estimated economic lives of the related assets 
competition we sell our products in intensely competitive and rapidly evolving markets 
we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small privately held companies to multinational corporations  and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
we do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our screening devices 
in the us  we sell our supply products in a mature market 
because these products can generate high margins  we expect that our products  particularly our hearing screening supply products  could face increasing competition  including competitors offering lower prices  which could have an adverse affect on our revenue and margins 
we believe the principal factors that will draw clinicians and other buyers to our newborn testing  monitoring  or treatment products  including hearing screening  jaundice management  and newborn metabolic screening products  include level of specificity  sensitivity  and reliability of the product  time required to obtain results with the product  such as to test for or treat a clinical condition  relative ease of use of the product  depth and breadth of the products features  quality of customer support for the product  frequency of product updates  extent of third party reimbursement of the cost of the product or procedure  extent to which the products conform to standards of care guidelines  and price of the product 
we believe that our primary competitive strength relates to the functionality and reliability of our products 
different competitors may have competitive advantages in one or more of the categories listed above and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products 

table of contents government regulation fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we propose to market in the us must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations under the food  drug  and cosmetics act  as amended clearance via section k  or premarket approval via section if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval via section is much more costly  lengthy  and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take even longer 
we cannot be sure that the fda will ever grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
the fda decides whether a device must undergo either the k clearance or premarket approval process based upon statutory criteria 
these criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives to be associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is substantially equivalent to devices that are already legally marketed 
the fda places devices deemed to pose relatively less risk in either class i or class ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting k clearance  unless an exemption applies 
the premarket notification must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to an existing legally marketed device that is a class i  class ii  pre amendment class iii device  or any of those for which the fda has not yet called for submission of a premarket approval 
the fda has classified our algo and echo screen hearing screeners and our neoblue phototherapy devices as class ii devices 
the fda has classified our nascor line of neonatal heatshields and oxygen delivery systems as class i devices 
the fda to date has not regulated data management software  including our neometrics newborn screening data management system 
the fda places devices deemed to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or devices deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a predicate device  in class iii 
the fda requires these devices to undergo the premarket approval process in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device 
a premarket approval application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data 
to date  the fda has not classified any of our products as class iii devices 
the fda may require results of clinical trials in support of a k submission and generally requires clinical trial results for a premarket approval application 
in order to conduct a clinical trial on a significant risk device  the fda requires manufacturers to apply for and obtain  in advance  an investigational device exemption 
the investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results 
if the fda and the institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites approve the investigational device exemption application for a significant risk device  the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial 
an investigational device exemption approval provides for a specified clinical protocol  including the number of patients and study sites 
if the manufacturer deems the product a non significant risk device  the product will be eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements 
if the institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites concur with the non significant risk determination  the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial

these requirements include fda quality system regulations which require manufacturers to create  implement  and follow design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures  medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda certain types of adverse and other events involving their products  and fda general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved uses 
class ii devices may also be subject to special controls applied to them  such as performance standards  post market surveillance  patient registries  and fda guidelines that may not apply to class i devices 
our products are currently subject to fda guidelines for k cleared devices and are not subject to any other form of special controls  such as a requirement to conduct a screening in a laboratory within a medical facility 
we believe we are in compliance with the applicable fda guidelines  but we could be required to change our compliance activities or be subject to other special controls if the fda changes its existing regulations or adopts new requirements 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to adequately comply  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  issuance of public notices or warnings  imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production  refusal of our requests for k clearance or pre market approval of new products  withdrawal of k clearance or pre market approval already granted  or criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to require repair  replacement  or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 
our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents other us regulations we also must comply with numerous additional federal  state  and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  biohazards  fire hazard control  and hazardous substance disposal 
we believe we are currently in compliance with applicable safety  quality  environmental protection  biohazard  and hazardous substance disposal regulations 
foreign regulation in the foreign countries in which we sell or plan to sell our fda regulated products  these products are also regulated as medical devices  and are subject to regulatory requirements by foreign governmental agencies similar to those of the fda 
our manufacturing facilities are audited and have been certified to be isol en compliant  which allows us to sell our products in europe 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to ce mark and iso inspection by t v rheinland 
we plan to seek approval to sell our products in additional countries 
the time and cost required to obtain market authorization from other countries and the requirements for licensing a product in another country may differ significantly from fda requirements

item a 
risk factors on january  we completed our acquisition of bio logic systems corp 
there are numerous risks associated with having completed the acquisition the completion of the acquisition may not result in improved operating results for us  or in our achieving financial condition superior to that which we would have achieved had we not completed the acquisition 
the acquisition could fail to produce the benefits that we anticipate  or could have other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
in addition  some of the assumptions that we have relied upon  such as achievement of operating synergies  may not be realized 
in this event  the acquisition could result in reduced earnings of natus as compared to the per share earnings that would have been achieved by natus if the acquisition had not occurred 
we used virtually all of our existing cash resources to complete the acquisition  and have also incurred indebtedness under a new credit facility for a portion of the purchase price 
this usage of cash has had an adverse impact on our liquidity  and will force us to place more reliance on cash flow from operations for our liquidity 
if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient for our needs  our business could be adversely affected 
if we are required to seek additional external financing to support our need for cash  we may not have access to financing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
alternatively  we may obtain additional financing on terms that are dilutive to existing holders of our common stock or that include covenants that restrict our business  or both 

table of contents we entered into a senior secured borrowing facility to obtain a portion of the funds needed to complete the acquisition 
the loan causes us to incur interest charges for such time as the loan is outstanding 
in addition  the loan contains various covenants by us that directly or indirectly restrict our ability to engage in activities that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of the company 
the loan is secured by the assets of the company  and this security interest may also negatively effect our flexibility to engage in financing or other activities in future periods 
if we fail to successfully integrate the operations of natus and bio logic  we may not realize the potential benefits of the acquisition 
the integration of the operations of natus and bio logic is a time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our operations if it is not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
bio logic s primary offices are located in mundelein  illinois and it also has employees and contractors in  among other places  israel and poland 
the geographical distance between bio logic s and our facilities may further adversely affect our ability to integrate these operations 
if this integration effort is not successful  our results of operations could be harmed  employee morale could decline  key employees could leave  and customers could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones 
in addition  we may not achieve the synergies or other benefits of the acquisition that we anticipate 
we may encounter the following difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating these operations failure to successfully manage relationships with customers and other important business partners  failure of customers to continue using the products and services of the combined company  the loss of key employees  challenges encountered in managing larger  more geographically dispersed operations  diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns  and potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of the acquisition 
we have a history of losses  variable quarterly results  and seasonality in the sale of our products  and may not maintain profitability in the future since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  including net losses for the years  and  and we may incur net losses in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
additionally  our revenue and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the following are among the factors that could cause our revenue  operating results  and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter budgeting cycle of our customers  particularly government entities  in the us and internationally  size and timing of specific sales  such as large purchases of our devices and systems or our supplies and services  by government agencies or hospital systems  trade in allowances or other concessions in connection with the introduction of new products or improvements to existing products  length and unpredictability of our sales cycle  particularly for our neometrics products which may have sales cycles that are longer or different from the sales cycles of our other products  and marked changes caused by rapidly evolving technology 
in addition  we experience seasonality in our revenue 
for example  our sales typically decline from our fourth fiscal quarter to our first fiscal quarter  due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers  many of which are government agencies 
we may also experience declining sales in the third fiscal quarter due to summer holiday and vacation schedules 
we anticipate that we 
table of contents will continue to experience these seasonal fluctuations  which may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
we believe that you should not rely on our results of operations for interim periods as an indication of our expected results in any future period 
we anticipate that it will become increasingly difficult for us to manage our expenses as we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our hearing screening and phototherapy product lines  the technologies we acquired from bio logic  and other products and technologies  develop additional applications for our current technology  increase our marketing and selling activities  particularly outside the us  develop additional infrastructure and hire required management and other employees to keep pace with our growth as a result of these factors  we may need to generate proportionately higher revenue to maintain profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
our operations may be restricted by the terms of our debt  which could adversely affect us the credit facility that we entered into to finance a portion of the purchase price of bio logic includes a number of restrictive covenants 
these covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs 
these covenants will  among other things  restrict our ability to incur more debt  create liens  pay dividends and make distributions or repurchase stock  make large capital expenditures  and merge  consolidate  or make other changes to our corporate structure  or transfer or sell assets 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet other financial covenants 
our failure to comply with these ratios or covenants would cause a default that  if not cured or waived  could result in our being required to repay the borrowing under our credit facility before its due date 
if we are unable to make this repayment or otherwise refinance the borrowing  the lender under our credit agreement could foreclose on our assets 
if we refinance the borrowing on less favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by increased costs and rates 
in addition  our failure to maintain covenants related to our credit agreement could have an impact on our other contractual arrangements that require us to maintain third party credit related covenants 
we may be unable to service our debt our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations with respect to our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt or sell certain of our assets 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to restructure or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with less favorable covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 

table of contents we have relied  and expect to continue to rely  on sales of our newborn screening products for the majority of our revenue  and a decline in sales of these products could cause our revenue to fall we expect that the revenue from our newborn hearing screening products will continue to account for a majority of our revenue for at least the next year 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of our newborn hearing screening devices and related supplies  or demand for our newborn hearing screening products  including physician acceptance or the selection of competing products  could cause our revenue to decline and our business to suffer 
in the united states we sell our newborn hearing screening products in a mature market we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small privately held companies to multinational corporations  and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
we do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our hearing screening devices 
in the us  we sell our supply products in a mature market 
because these products can generate high margins  we expect that our products  particularly our hearing screening supply products  could face increasing competition  including competitors offering lower prices  which could have an adverse affect on our revenue and margins 
we believe that our primary competitive strength relates to the functionality and reliability of our products 
our competitors may have certain competitive advantages which include the ability to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
consequently  we may need to increase our efforts  and related expenses for research and development  to maintain or improve our position 
we expect recurring sales to our existing customers to generate a majority of our revenue in the future  and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase products from us  our revenue may decline 
our business could be harmed if our competitors establish cooperative relationships with large medical device vendors or rapidly acquire market share through industry consolidation large medical device vendors may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors 
we expect that the medical device industry will continue to consolidate 
new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 
our operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing  acquiring and marketing additional products or improving our existing products we intend to develop and acquire additional products and technologies for the screening  detection  treatment  monitoring and tracking of common medical ailments 
developing and acquiring new products  and improving our existing products  to meet the needs of current and future customers requires significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to successfully sell new products or update our existing products  our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles 
in order to accurately recognize revenue on long term development and implementation contracts associated with our neometrics newborn screening data management systems  we must be able to accurately estimate the total cost of completing a project 
in arriving at these estimates  we must make assumptions about future costs that may prove to be inaccurate 
we recognize revenue from our neometrics newborn screening data management systems  which are generally highly configurable  on the percentage of completion basis over the development and implementation 
table of contents period of the associated installation 
the development and implementation period typically ranges from six to nine months 
in order to determine percentage of completion  we must be able to accurately estimate the total cost of the development and implementation process 
if our estimates of the future costs to be incurred are understated  our future gross profit would be negatively impacted  and the impact could be material to our results of operations 
if we fail in our efforts to educate clinicians  government agency personnel  and third party payors on the effectiveness of our products we will not achieve future sales growth it is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians  hospital administrators  and government agencies about our products and the costs and benefits of their use 
the commercial success of our products depends upon clinician  government agency  and other third party payor confidence in the economic and clinical benefits of our products as well as their comfort with the efficacy  reliability  sensitivity  and specificity of our products 
we believe that clinicians will not use our products unless they determine  based on published peer reviewed journal articles and experience  that our products provide an accurate and cost effective alternative to other means of testing or treatment 
our customers may choose to use competitive products  which may be less expensive or may provide faster results than our devices 
clinicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products  testing practices  and clinical treatments  partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement 
if more clinicians  government agencies  and hospital administrators do not adopt our products  we may not maintain profitability 
factors that may adversely affect the medical community s acceptance of our products include publication of clinical study results that demonstrate a lack of efficacy or cost effectiveness of our products  changing governmental and physician group guidelines  performance  quality  price  and total cost of ownership of our products relative to other such products  our ability to maintain and enhance our existing relationships and to form new relationships with leading physicians  physician organizations  hospitals  state laboratory personnel  and third party payors  changes in state and third party payor reimbursement policies for our products  and adoption of federal  state and foreign laws mandating or requiring universal newborn hearing screening and metabolic screening 
our plan to expand our international operations will result in increased costs and is subject to numerous risks  if our efforts are not successful  this could harm our business the domestic market for our algo hearing screening products is mature and we plan to expand our international sales and marketing efforts to increase sales of our products in foreign countries 
following our acquisition of fischer zoth in september  sales of our echo screen oae device have contributed to a significant portion of our sales outside the us we have only begun over the past five years to significantly develop our distributor sales force outside the us we may not realize corresponding growth in revenue from growth in international unit sales  due to the lower average selling prices we receive on sales outside of the us even if we are able to successfully expand our international selling efforts  we cannot be certain that we will be able to create or increase demand for our products outside of the us our international operations are subject to other risks  which include impact of possible recessions in economies outside the us  political and economic instability  including instability related to war and terrorist attacks in the us and abroad  
table of contents contractual provisions governed by foreign law  such as local law rights to sales commissions by terminated distributors  dependence of demand for our products on health care spending by foreign governments  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  difficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions  difficulty in obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approval  and attitudes by clinicians  and cost reimbursement policies  towards use of disposable supplies that are potentially unfavorable to our business 
if guidelines mandating universal newborn screening do not continue to develop in foreign countries and governments do not mandate testing of all newborns as we anticipate  or if those guidelines have a long phase in period  our revenues may not grow we estimate that approximately to of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing prior to discharge from the hospital 
to date  there has been only limited adoption of newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge by foreign governments  and the phase in period varies from several months to several years 
the widespread adoption of these guidelines depends  in part  on our ability to educate foreign government agencies  neonatologists  pediatricians  third party payors  and hospital administrators about the benefits of universal newborn screening as well as the use of our products to perform the screening and monitoring 
our revenues may not grow if governments do not require universal newborn screening prior to hospital discharge  or if physicians or hospitals are slow to comply with those guidelines  or if governments provide for a lengthy phase in period for compliance 
because we rely on distributors or sub distributors to sell our products in most of our markets outside of the us  our revenue could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us  or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated we currently rely on our distributors or sub distributors for a majority of our sales outside the us our reliance on international distributors has increased with our decision in to close our japanese sales subsidiary and sell through a distributor in japan  and our acquisition of fischer zoth  which sells its products through distributors in europe and asia 
some distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and education of clinicians and government agencies 
we intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in europe  japan and other developed countries 
if we fail to sell our products through our international distributors  we would experience a decline in revenues unless we begin to sell our products directly in those markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
even if we are successful in selling our products through new distributors  the rate of growth of our revenue could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell a large dollar volume of our products 
none of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products 
we may be subject to foreign laws governing our relationships with our international distributors 
these laws may require us to make payments to our distributors if we terminate our relationship for any reason  including for cause 
some countries require termination payments under local law or legislation that may supersede our contractual relationship with the distributor 
these payments could be equal to a year or more of gross profit on sales of our products that the distributor would have earned 
we have terminated our relationship with certain distributors in the past 
to date  we have not been required to make any material termination payments under local laws 
any required payments would adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents our operating results may suffer because of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and may require us to engage in foreign currency hedging substantially all of our sales contracts to our us based customers provide for payment in us dollars 
in addition  sales to most of our international distributors provide for payment in us dollars 
however  substantially all of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
to date we have not undertaken any foreign currency hedging transactions and  as a result  our future revenue and expenses may be unpredictable due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the translation of assets denominated in foreign currencies 
if health care providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our devices or supplies  or if reimbursement policies change adversely  we may not be successful marketing and selling new products or technologies clinicians  hospitals  and government agencies are unlikely to purchase our products if clinicians are not adequately reimbursed for the procedures conducted with our devices or supplies 
unless a sufficient amount of conclusive  peer reviewed clinical data about our products has been published  third party payors  including insurance companies and government agencies  may refuse to provide reimbursement 
furthermore  even if reimbursement is provided  it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals 
some third party payors may refuse adequate reimbursement unless the infant has demonstrable risk factors 
if health care providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for our products or the screenings conducted with our products  it is unlikely that our products will ever achieve significant market acceptance 
acceptance of our products in international markets will depend upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement  funding and health care payment systems vary significantly by country 
we may not obtain approvals for reimbursement in a timely manner or at all 
adverse changes in reimbursement policies in general could harm our business 
we are unable to predict changes in the reimbursement methods used by third party health care payors  particularly those in countries and regions outside the us for example  some payors are moving toward a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
in a managed care system the cost of our products may not be incorporated into the overall payment for childbirth and newborn care or there may not be adequate reimbursement for our products separate from reimbursement for the procedure 
unless the cost of screening or treatment is reimbursed as a standard component of newborn care  universal screening is unlikely to occur and the number of infants likely to be screened with our products will be substantially reduced 
if we lose our relationship with any supplier of key product components or our relationship with a supplier deteriorates or key components are not available in sufficient quantities  our manufacturing could be delayed and our business could suffer we contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and the production of our disposable products 
some of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us 
we have relatively few sources of supply for some of the components used in our products and in some cases we rely entirely on sole source suppliers 
in addition  the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable 
for example  during  we experienced delays on the part of a supplier to provide us with volume production of our new flexicoupler supplies 
in  we relied on a single supplier of cables used in our algo hearing screening devices to help us complete a field replacement program of those cables 
if these or other suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements  it might be difficult to establish additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner  or at all 
this would cause our product sales to be disrupted and our revenue and operating results to suffer 
replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations 
incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or 
table of contents approval of the filing before we could resume product sales 
this process may take a substantial period of time  and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval 
this could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices  which would reduce our revenue and gross profits from these sales we have entered  and may in the future enter  into agreements with customers who purchase high volumes of our products 
our agreements with these customers may contain discounts from our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations  which could cause our revenue and profits to decline 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of gpos  which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals  group practices and other clinics 
while we make sales directly to gpo members  the members of these gpos now receive volume discounts from our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us 
sales to members of one gpo  novation  llc  accounted for approximately   and  of our total revenue in the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
sales to members of gpos accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue during the months ended december    and  respectively 
other of our existing customers may be members of gpos with which we do not have agreements 
our sales efforts through gpos may conflict with our direct sales efforts to our existing customers 
if we enter into agreements with new gpos and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those gpos  our revenue and profits could decline 
if material weaknesses in the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting are identified and reported as a result of the assessment required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
we completed an implementation project in preparation for our first section reporting requirement that was effective for the year ending december  and the report of management is contained herein 
this report contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm that has audited our financial statements for the year ended december  also attested to and reported on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as well as the operating effectiveness of our internal controls  and their attestation is contained herein 
while we have expended significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by section  there is a risk that in the future we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by section if we do not continue to maintain an effectively designed and operating system of internal control  we may be unable to comply with the requirements of section in the future 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
our failure to obtain necessary fda clearances or approvals or to comply with fda regulations could hurt our ability to commercially distribute and market our products in the us  and this would harm our business and financial condition unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations clearance via section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetics act of  as amended  or 
table of contents premarket approval via section of the food  drug  and cosmetics act if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take even longer 
the fda may not grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
furthermore  if the fda concludes that future products using our technology do not meet the requirements to obtain k clearance  we would have to seek premarket approval 
the fda may impose the more burdensome premarket approval requirement on modifications to our existing products or future products  which in either case could be costly and cause us to divert our attention and resources from the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products 
our business may suffer if we are required to revise our labeling or promotional materials  or the fda takes an enforcement action against us for off label uses we may not promote or advertise the algo and echo screen devices  minimuffs  neoblue phototherapy device products  or any future cleared or approved devices  for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported promotional claims about the benefits of our products 
if the fda determines that our claims are outside the scope of our clearances or are unsupported it could require us to revise our promotional claims or take enforcement action against us 
if we were subject to such an action by the fda  our sales could be delayed  our revenue could decline  and our reputation among clinicians could be harmed 
our business would be harmed if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations or we do not pass an inspection we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda concerning compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with these requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  issuance of public notices or warnings  imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production  refusal of our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawal of k clearance or premarket approvals already granted  or criminal prosecution 
if we fail to obtain and maintain necessary foreign regulatory approvals in order to market and sell our products outside of the us  we may not be able to sell our products in other countries our products that are regulated domestically by the fda are also regulated outside the us by foreign governmental agencies similar to the fda and are subject to regulatory requirements similar to those of the fda 
the time and cost required to obtain market authorization from other countries and the requirements for licensing a product in another country may differ significantly from fda requirements 
we may not be able to obtain these approvals without incurring significant expenses or at all  and we may not be able to maintain these approvals once they have been obtained 

table of contents if we  or our suppliers  fail to comply with applicable regulations  sales of our products could be delayed and our revenue could be harmed every manufacturer of a finished medical device  including natus and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers  is required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation and comparable regulations of states and other countries 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through periodic inspections 
we or our contract manufacturers  may fail to pass future quality system regulation inspections 
if we  or our contract manufacturers  fail one of these inspections in the future  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing and sales delayed significantly until we can demonstrate adequate compliance 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to take adequate corrective action in a timely fashion in response to a quality system regulation inspection  the fda could shut down our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing operations or require us  among other things  to recall our products  either of which would harm our business 
governmental  environmental  health and safety regulations could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are subject to complex and stringent environmental  health  safety and other governmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to a varied and complex body of laws and regulations 
existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us  that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we may not be successful in integrating the businesses that we acquire  or such businesses may not be accretive to earnings or perform as projected we acquired intellectual property assets and technology patents from pemstar pacific consultants during  and we acquired the assets of neometrics inc and affiliated entities during  we acquired fischer zoth in and we acquired bio logic systems corp 
in early we expect to make additional acquisitions of products  technology assets or businesses in the future as part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product offerings 
in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including inability to effectively integrate acquired products into our business  loss of key personnel of the acquired company  failure to realize expected synergies  failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  failure to maintain customers of  or other relationships existing with respect to  the acquired business  failure to successfully develop the acquired technology into the desired products or enhancements  assumption of unknown liabilities  failure to understand and compete effectively in markets and with products or technologies with which we have limited previous experience  and write off of goodwill and intangible assets related to such acquisitions 
our acquisitions of products  technology assets  or businesses may have a negative impact on our business if we fail to achieve the anticipated financial  strategic  and other benefits of acquisitions or investments  and our operating results may suffer because of this 
future changes in technology or market conditions result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets  resulting in additional charges that could significantly impact our operating results at december   we had significant intangible assets  including goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
as a result of our acquisition of bio logic  these assets will increase significantly 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
our ability 
table of contents to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets might be hindered by events over which we have no control 
due to the highly competitive nature of the medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions where our products are no longer competitive 
any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in additional charges  which could significantly impact our operating results 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our intellectual property because we may not be able to protect access to our intellectual property or we may lose our intellectual property rights due to expiration of our licenses or patents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights do not adequately cover the technology we employ  other medical device companies could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  others may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and may divert our management s attention and resources 
failing to enforce our intellectual property rights could also result in the loss of those rights 
our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award the medical technology industry has  in the past  been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
we expect that medical screening products may become increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties such as individuals  educational institutions or other medical device companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could have any of the following negative consequences result in costly litigation and damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or suspensions  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of infringement against us could result in a substantial damage award and materially harm our financial condition 
our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  or design and build non infringing products  could prevent us from selling our products and adversely affect our business and financial results 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates the sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of a product liability claim by someone claiming to have been injured using one of our products or claiming that one of our products failed to perform properly 
a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition 
our product liability insurance may not protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 

table of contents we depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and  without additional employees  we cannot grow or maintain profitability our products and technologies are complex  and we depend substantially on the continued service of our senior management team 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development process 
our future success also will depend  in part  on the continued service of our key management personnel  software engineers  and other research and development employees and our ability to identify  hire  and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing  and sales staff 
hiring research and development  engineering  sales  marketing and customer service personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of pediatric audiology  neonatal jaundice management  and neonatal metabolic screening 
we may be unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we could lose the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards  which may adversely affect our financial results as of december   we had a total federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards  if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  will expire in various amounts beginning in through for state and or federal income tax purposes 
if we continue to have net losses  we may not be able to utilize some or all of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  us income tax law imposes limitations on the ability of corporations to use net operating loss carryforwards if the corporation experiences a more than change in ownership during any three year period 
we may take actions  such as the issuance of additional stock  which would cause an ownership change to occur 
accordingly  we may be limited to the amount we can use in any given year  so even if we have substantial net income  we may not be able to use our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs  and are thus subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
we have not undertaken a study to determine whether such limitations exist  and if so  the extent of such limitations 
however  we believe it is probable that some amount of our net operating losses will be affected 
if we are unable to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  our future tax payments could be higher and our financial results may suffer 
our stockholder rights plan and anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire a large portion of our securities  to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest  or to acquire us  even though such events may be beneficial to our stockholders we maintain a stockholder rights plan that is designed to deter unsolicited takeover activity with respect to our company 
in addition  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may affect the price of our common stock  and could make it more difficult for a third party to remove our management 
further  these provisions may make it more difficult to acquire a large portion of our securities  to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest or acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders

supplies and services revenue results from sales of supplies for our algo and echo screen medical devices  the nascor product line  software maintenance agreements for our neometrics data management systems  as well extended service agreements on our medical devices 
devices and systems revenue results from the sale of our algo  echo screen  and neoblue medical devices  and installations of our neometrics newborn screening data management systems 
on january   we acquired bio logic systems corp 
bio logic pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of october  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of bio logic common stock was converted into the right to receive in cash 
each outstanding option to acquire bio logic common stock was cancelled  with the holder of the option receiving  for each share covered 
table of contents by the option  an amount equal to the excess if any of over the exercise price per share of the option 
the total aggregate payment by the company to the former stockholders and option holders of bio logic was approximately million  exclusive of direct costs associated with the acquisition 
in their form k for the year ended february  filed with the securities and exchange commission  bio logic reported revenue of million and net income of million 
on january   the company initiated an integration plan the plan related to the acquisition of bio logic 
under the plan  the company will be reducing the size of its combined workforce by approximately employees  representing approximately of the workforce of the company 
the objectives of the plan are to eliminate redundant costs resulting from the merging of the company and bio logic and improve efficiencies in operations 
the company expects that total employee severance costs related to the staff reductions will be approximately million  including costs related to change of control provisions in the employment contracts of the chief executive officer  chief operating officer  and two vice presidents of bio logic totaling approximately million 
these costs will be recorded as a liability assumed as of the consummation date of the merger 
as a result of the acquisition of bio logic and the integration plan  which are more fully described in note subsequent events of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report  the company had approximately employees on march  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of natus relates primarily to historical information prior to the acquisition of bio logic 
the discussion has been supplemented with information regarding the impact of the acquisition of bio logic on the business of natus 
unless noted  the information and other disclosures presented herein refer to natus prior to the acquisition and thus exclude related information pertaining to bio logic 
year overview during natus completed its first full year of profitability since the year the company reported net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
the company benefited from the operating cost reduction plan that was implemented in june as well as the acquisition of fischer zoth  which was completed in september in march  we signed a private label agreement with fisher paykel healthcare  a leading manufacturer of neonatal warmers  resuscitators and respiratory care devices 
under the agreement  fisher paykel markets a customized model of the company s neoblue mini led phototherapy light that mounts onto the fisher paykel cosycot r infant warmer 
the device retains the neoblue mini led phototherapy brand name under the fisher paykel corporate label 
in april  natus announced that more than million newborns had been screened worldwide with the company s algo newborn hearing screener and echo screen hearing screener devices 
natus also provided further evidence of its leadership position in the hearing screening market  reporting that more than  units of its algo and echo screen devices have been sold 
in october  the company launched the first two installations of its neometrics internet newborn screening information system transfer insist software application for the national newborn screening information system nnsis in tennessee and alabama 
nnsis is a collaborative effort designed by the national newborn screening and genetics resource center nnsgrc  funded by a grant from the health resources and services administration hrsa  and developed by the company s neometrics division 
nnsis is a secure  real time data collection and reporting system  which allows states and us territories to report newborn screening results and statistics to the nnsgrc through a convenient web browser interface 
in october  natus received fda k clearance for the newest extension of its neoblue line of led phototherapy lights 
the neoblue cozy  with its streamlined  oval design conforms to the shape of the baby and 
table of contents provides a light source from underneath the patient 
the light source exposes the full length of the baby from head to toe  covering a larger surface area than standard phototherapy blankets  pads  or beds 
the company will begin marketing the neoblue cozy in the first quarter of we estimate that approximately to of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing prior to discharge from the hospital 
as such  the us market is a mature and competitive market 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our screening devices 
because these products can generate high margins  we may face increasing competition 
we believe that our primary competitive advantage relates to the functionality and reliability of our products and that other suppliers may compete against us by offering lower prices 
we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us and to distributors who sell our products in over other countries 
we intend to continue expansion of our international operations because we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
international sales made to distributors are characterized by lower gross margins due to the discount from our list prices the distributors receive 
revenue from international sales as a percent of total sales was  and of our revenue during  and  respectively 
for the year ended february   bio logic reported that of their revenue was generated through international sales 
consequently  we believe that our international revenue as a percent of total revenue will decrease in  although we expect that we will continue to experience revenue growth in our international markets 
our net income or loss can be markedly impacted by the decisions of management regarding the level of resources applied to our business 
management and our board of directors make these decisions on the basis of sales forecasts  expected customer orders  economic conditions  and other factors 
these costs are primarily personnel and facilities costs that are relatively fixed in the short term and directly impact net income 
as of december   we had total federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in and continuing through  and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire through if we have net losses in the future  or if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire  the benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
in addition  us income tax law imposes limitations on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards we can use in any given year and on the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards if we experience a more than change in ownership during any three year period 
application of critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in so doing  we must often make estimates and use assumptions that can be subjective  and consequently our actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments could have a material affect on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  from sales of medical devices and supplies  including sales to distributors  when a purchase order has been received  when title transfers generally upon shipment  when the selling price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents terms of sales to distributors are exw  reflecting that goods are shipped ex works  in which title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point 
revenue from our neometrics newborn screening data management systems  which are generally highly configurable  is recognized on the percentage of completion basis over the development and implementation period of the associated installation  which typically ranges from six to months 
revenue from extended service and maintenance agreements  for both medical devices and data management systems  is recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as otherwise described above 
we generally do not provide rights of return on products 
we accept trade ins of our own and competitive medical devices 
trade ins are recorded as a reduction of the replacement medical device sale 
provisions are made for initial standard warranty obligations of one year  and post sale training and customer support at the time the related revenue is recognized 
more than of the hospitals in the us are members of one or more group purchasing organizations which negotiate volume purchase prices for member hospitals  group practices  and other clinics 
we have entered into agreements with several gpos that typically contain preferential terms for the gpo and its members  including provisions for some  if not all  of the following negotiated pricing for all group members  volume discounts and other preferential terms on their member s direct purchases from us  promotion of natus products by the gpo to its members  payment of marketing fees by natus to the gpo  usually based on purchasing experience of group members  and non recourse cancellation provisions 
gpos do not generally purchase products from us 
hospitals  group practices  and other clinics that are members of a gpo purchase products directly from us under the terms negotiated by the gpo 
negotiated pricing and discounts are recognized as a reduction of the selling price of our products rather than as an expense 
revenue from sales to members of gpos is otherwise consistent with our general revenue recognition policies as previously described 
we must exercise judgment when assessing the sufficiency of our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimates are based on our historical collection experience within the markets in which we operate as well as assessment of our average accounts receivable aging days and any other specific information of which we may be aware  such as bankruptcy filings or liquidity problems of our customers 
any future determination that our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable is understated could result in increased operating expense and reduce our results of operations 
at december  our deferred revenue under extended service and maintenance agreements  and billings in excess of recognized revenue on percentage of completion contracts was approximately  other advance payments from customers were not material at december  our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable was  at december  inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value as a medical device manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to technological changes in our markets  competitive pressures in products and prices  and our own introduction of new product lines 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales  product life cycles  and market acceptance of new products 
when we identify inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage we write it down to realizable 
table of contents salvage value or provide for inventory valuation reserves 
the estimates we use in projecting future product demand may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our inventory is overvalued could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 
at december   we had inventories with a carrying value of million 
carrying value of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives  any future changes that would limit their useful lives or any determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their fair value could result in additional charges 
we carry goodwill and any other intangible assets with indefinite lives at original cost but do not amortize them 
any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in additional charges  which could significantly impact our operating results 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually as of october st of each year  this assessment is also performed whenever there is a change in circumstances that indicates the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
similarly  we test our definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
impairment is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value 
estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products  product acceptance and lifecycle  competition  appropriate discount rates  and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which could have a significant impact on our operating results 
at december  we had goodwill and other intangible assets with a net carrying value of approximately million 
our goodwill and other intangible assets will increase significantly as a result of our acquisition of bio logic 
liability for product warranties our medical device products are covered by standard one year product warranty plans 
a liability has been established for the expected cost of servicing our medical device products during these service periods 
we base the liability in part upon our historical experience  however  estimates of the costs to honor our warranties are often difficult to determine due to uncertainty surrounding the extent to which new products will require servicing and the costs that will be incurred to service those products 
until we have historical experience of the cost to honor warranties on new products  we base additions to the reserve on a combination of factors including the standard cost of the product  experience with similar products  and other judgments  such as the degree to which the product incorporates new technology 
the estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our product warranty reserves are understated could result in increases to our cost of sales and reductions in our operating margins and results of operations 
at december  our reserve for product warranties was  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which result primarily from net operating loss and credit carryforwards that expire over time  and temporary differences between book and tax results that will reverse in the future 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed sufficient future taxable income to completely offset tax loss carryforwards in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  or increase this allowance in 
table of contents a period  we include an offsetting expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
future income generation in these tax jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and additional income recognition 
at december   our net deferred tax assets were zero  net of a million valuation allowance

comparison of and in june  the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  relating to an operating cost reduction plan that resulted in an immediate reduction of employees and the accrual of associated employee termination related benefits of  primarily for severance compensation and salary continuation 
although the employee reductions came from production  marketing and sales  research and development  and administrative  approximately of the costs associated with the restructuring came from administrative  and business development  which is a component of marketing and sales

the increase in sales in the uk and europe was offset by lower sales in asia 
international sales of devices and systems increased million to million  and international sales of supplies and services remained stable at million 
while unit sales of algo supplies increased  the increase was offset by a reduction in average selling prices in our international markets

liquidity and capital resources at december   we reported cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  an increase of million from million reported at december  we reported working capital of million at december   compared to million at december  liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing or to raise capital 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of our current funds and the potential to increase those funds in the future

bio logic acquisition  wells fargo bank million financing on january  we acquired bio logic systems corp 
in a cash acquisition valued at million  excluding direct costs of the acquisition 
in addition to using cash acquired from bio logic  we used million of our available cash  including million we received in a private placement of our stock in october  to fund the acquisition 
in addition  we borrowed million on a senior secured credit facility with wells fargo bank 
the outstanding principal balance under this facility as of the close of business on january  is payable in installments over months  with a final installment consisting of all remaining unpaid principal due and payable in full on december  the credit facility contains covenants  including covenants relating to financial reporting and notification  compliance with laws  maintenance of books and records  maintenance of properties and insurance  and limitations on guaranties  investments  issuance of debt  lease obligations and capital expenditures 
the credit facility provides for events of default  including failure to pay any principal or interest when due  failure to perform or observe covenants  bankruptcy or insolvency events and the occurrence of a material adverse effect 
following this acquisition our cash reserves and working capital have been significantly reduced 
however  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital requirements 
we intend to continue to acquire additional technologies  products or businesses  and these acquisitions could be significant 
these actions would likely affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships  or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants and increase our cost of capital

the company believes the additional purchase consideration to be paid in the future will not exceed million  a portion of which is denominated in euro 
if paid  the additional purchase consideration will be paid out over periods through december  net cash provided by financing activities increased by million  to million in  from million in in anticipation of our acquisition of bio logic  we raised million in a private placement of our common stock in october at the then current trading price for our shares 
we also generated cash from financing activities in both and through purchases of our stock pursuant to our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
comparison of and net cash provided by operations was million in  compared to cash used in operations of million in in june  we implemented an operating cost reduction plan that resulted in an immediate reduction of employees  representing approximately of our then current workforce 
this action contributed significantly to the million income from continuing operations we reported in the second half of we also reported approximately million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense in these factors contributed to the net increase in cash provided by operations in in addition  cash provided by operations in was significantly impacted by a reduction in inventories and an increase in accrued liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
in late we temporarily increased the inventory of our hearing screening supply product because our supplier was moving their production facility 
our accounts receivable increased because sales in the fourth quarter of were approximately  more than the comparable period in accrued expenses increased due to a number of factors including severance and employee transition obligations  as well as other accrued compensation

table of contents future liquidity our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenue  extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  extent to which we make acquisitions  cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  cost and timing of marketing and selling activities  and availability of borrowings under line of credit arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 
in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments primarily result from firm  noncancellable purchase orders placed with contract vendors that manufacture some of the components used in our medical devices and related disposable supply products  as well as commitments for leased office  manufacturing  and warehouse facilities 
the impact that our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years unconditional purchase obligations operating lease obligations total unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to purchase orders with our suppliers for materials used in our production processes 
the table above does not include obligations under employment agreements for services rendered in the normal course of business 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the us and sell those products primarily in the us  europe  and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
most of our sales in europe and asia are denominated in us dollars 
with the acquisition of fischer zoth in september  a portion of our sales are now denominated in the euro 
as our sales in currencies other than the us dollar increase  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may increase 
in addition  changes in exchange rates also may affect the end user prices of our products compared to those of our foreign competitors  who may be selling their products based on local currency pricing 
these factors may make our products less competitive in some countries 
if the us dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net income would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the year ended december  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
however  as substantially all of our short term investments carry a fixed rate of interest  a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned on investments held at december  through the date of maturity on those investments 

table of contents the fair value of our available for sale securities is also sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  and the fair value of our portfolio will fall if market interest rates increase 
however  since we generally have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  these declines in fair value may never be realized 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results may differ as our analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates does not account for  among other things  sales of securities prior to maturity and repurchase of replacement securities  the change in mix or quality of the investments in the portfolio  and changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in short term investments that carry relatively short maturities because our intent is to have cash resources available for potential acquisitions of additional technologies  products  or businesses  and these acquisitions could be significant
