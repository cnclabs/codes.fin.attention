critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in particular  judgment is used in areas such as the inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets  accruals for self insurance  litigation  store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs  stock based compensation and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory costs for bbb and harmon are calculated using the retail inventory method and inventory cost for cts is calculated using the first in  first out cost method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been written down to the company s best estimate of their realizable value 
judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise and anticipated demand 
actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions 
the company estimates its reserve for shrinkage throughout the year  based on historical shrinkage 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of the company s physical inventory count 
historically  the company s shrinkage has not been volatile 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred  the loss would be recognized during that period 
the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the fair value 
the company has not historically had any material impairment of long lived assets 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the fair value of the company s long lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 
goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
the company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 
self insurance the company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability and employee related health care benefits a portion of which is paid by its employees 
liabilities associated with the risks that the company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
although the company s claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past  actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future 
factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to inflation  the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes 
in the future  if the company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required  the liability will be adjusted accordingly 
litigation the company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel  where appropriate 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates  as appropriate 
the ultimate resolution of these ongoing matters as a result of future developments could have a material impact on the company s earnings 
the company cannot predict the nature and validity of claims which could be asserted in the future  and future claims could have a material impact on its earnings

r 
under sfas no 
r  the company uses a black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its stock options 
the black scholes model includes various assumptions  including the expected life of stock options  the expected volatility and the expected risk free interest rate 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  total stock based compensation cost  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r could have been materially impacted
