item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act if  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including any statements regarding projections of earnings  statements regarding the future results of ecera  revenues  gross margins or other financial items  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future purchases of capital equipment  future expenditures  potential acquisitions  proposed new products or services and their development schedule  industry  technological or market trends  our ability to address the need for application specific logic products  our ability to respond rapidly to customer needs  expanding product sales  future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  or continue  or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the forward looking statements will prove to be correct  and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are set forth herein in item a  risk factors  of this report and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this annual report are made as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statement or reason why actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make difficult judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated future returns and other charges against revenue is recorded at the time of shipment 
for the twelve months ended july  the majority of our sales were to distributors 
we sell products to both large domestic and international distributors 
sales to domestic distributors are sold at the price listed in our price book for that distributor 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
at the time of shipment  we book a sales reserve for the entire amount if the customer has the right to return the product 
also  at the time of sale we book a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ssd s  stock rotations  return material authorizations rma s  authorized price protection programs  and any special programs approved by management 
these sales reserves offset against revenues  which then leads to the net revenue amount we report 
the market price for our products can be significantly different than the book price at which the product was sold to the distributor 
when the market price  as compared with the book price  of a particular sales opportunity from our distributor to their customer would result in low or negative margins to our distributor  a ship from stock and debit is negotiated with the distributor 
ssd history is analyzed and used to develop ssd rates that form the basis of the ssd sales reserve booked each period 
we use historical ssd rates to estimate the ultimate net sales price to the distributor 
our distribution agreements provide for semi annual stock rotation privileges of typically of net sales for the previous six month period 
the contractual stock rotation applies only to shipments at book price 
asian distributors typically buy our product at less than book price and therefore are not entitled to the stock 
table of contents rotation privilege 
in order to provide for routine inventory refreshing  for our benefit as well as theirs  we typically grant asian distributors stock rotation privileges between and even though we are not contractually obligated to do so 
each month a sales reserve is recorded for the estimated stock rotation privilege earned by our distributors that month 
this reserve is the sum of product of each distributor s net sales for the month and their stock rotation percentage 
from time to time  customers may request to return parts for various reasons including the customers belief that the parts are not performing to specification 
many such return requests are the result of customers incorrectly using the parts  not because the parts are defective 
these requests are reviewed by management and when approved result in a return material authorization rma being established 
we are only obligated to accept returns of defective parts 
for customer convenience  we may approve a particular return request  even though we are not obligated to do so 
each month a sales reserve is recorded for the approved rmas that have not yet been returned 
in the past we have not kept a general warranty reserve because historically valid warranty returns  which are the result of a part not meeting specifications or being non functional  have been immaterial and parts can frequently be re sold to other customers for use in other applications 
we do however monitor and assess rma activity and overall materiality to assess whether a general warranty reserve has become appropriate 
price protection is granted solely at the discretion of pericom management 
the purpose of price protection is to reduce our distributor s cost of inventory as market prices fall thus reducing ssd rates 
pericom sales management prepares price protection proposals for individual products located at individual distributors 
pericom general management reviews these proposals and if a particular price protection arrangement is approved  then the dollar impact will be estimated based on the book price reduction per unit for the products approved and the number of units of those products in that distributor s inventory 
a sales reserve is then recorded in that period for the estimated amount in accordance with issue of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
at the discretion of pericom management  we may offer rebates on specific products sold to specific end customers 
the purpose of the rebates is to allow for pricing adjustments for large programs without affecting the pricing we charge our distributor customers 
the rebate we owe is recorded at the time of shipment 
customers are typically granted payment terms of between and days and they generally pay within those terms 
relatively few customers have been granted terms with cash discounts 
distributors are invoiced for shipments at book price 
when they pay those invoices  they claim debits for ssds  stock rotations  cash discounts  rmas and price protection when appropriate 
once claimed  these debits are then processed against the approvals 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period of time 
the semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially impacting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which the company adopted in fiscal  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company determined that no impairment of its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets existed in fiscal the company also tests other definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company determined that no impairment of these other definite lived intangible assets existed in fiscal 
table of contents investments 
we have also made other investments including loans  bridge loans convertible to equity or asset purchases as well as direct equity investments 
these loans and investments are made with strategic intentions and have been in privately held technology companies  which by their nature are high risk 
these investments are included in other assets in the balance sheet and are carried at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
deferred tax assets 
the company s deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
if  in the future  the company experiences losses for a sustained period of time  the company may not be able to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
if this occurs  the company may be required to increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
overview pericom semiconductor corporation was incorporated in june we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and frequency control products used for the transfer  routing  and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
since then we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others in fiscal  volt bit logic circuits and bit digital switches  in fiscal  clock generators  volt clock synthesizers and buffers  and high speed interface products for the networking industry in fiscal  in fiscal  bit logic  bit digital switches and pentium  k modem and laser printer clock synthesizers  in fiscal  an analog switch family  mixed voltage logic and a family of clock generators  in fiscal  a family of advanced volt cmos logic  timing devices for pentium and pentium ii mobile computers  a complete solution for the pc memory module standard  and a volt bus switch family offering the fastest bus switches on the market  in fiscal  three families of volt zero delay clock drivers for the networking and telecommunications markets  a family of application specific bus switches and integrated clock generators to support the latest intel processors and a complete interface solution for the pc memory module standard  in fiscal  a crossbar switch for backplane applications like server clusters  networking  industrial computing and storage area networks  a family of drivers  receivers  and transceivers supporting the low voltage differential signaling interface standard  the superclock programmable skew timing product family targeting networking  telecommunications and storage area network applications  a complete interface solution for the new double data rate ddr sdram memory standard  a family of lvds cross point switches to route signals in oc networks  and the avc family of high speed interface logic  in fiscal  a volt switch products and complementary complete timing interface solution for use in double data rate ddr synchronous dram modules  lvds products for the networking market including both dual and quad crosspoint switches for both point to point and bus communications  several hot plug switches that support the growing demand for operations  expansion of the volt avc family  and low voltage bus switch products that provide volt to volt and volt to volt level translation  
table of contents in fiscal  advanced avc products that allow voltage shifting between volts and volts and i o translation from hstl to lvttl commonly needed between the latest state of the art asics and other legacy products  enhancements to our ddr memory module solutions  active termination clamp that help to clean up signaling overshoot common at fast clock rates  additional family of seven analog multiplexers and switches with improved performance  which are used in a wide range of space constrained mobile and handheld computing applications  and a family of single  dual  and triple gate logic devices in extremely small packaging that address a very broad range of applications and systems requirements  and in fiscal  a family of intel compatible pci bridge products that offer higher margins  v low r on ohm general purpose switches  support for ddr i at mhz and mhz plus our first ddr ii products  gigabit lan switch used in notebook computers  vcxo for set top boxes and dsl products  and we expanded our standard logic product line 
in fiscal  the company expanded its bridge product line to include enhanced features  higher performance and to support the pci x bus 
it brought to market low voltage analog switches with r on of ohms 
application specific nd generation gigibit lan switches and usb switches were introduced to the customer base 
supervisory products including watchdog timers and reset circuits premiered from pericom 
during the year  saronix was acquired bringing high performance frequency control products to our comprehensive product portfolio 
in fiscal  we introduced our product solution to support the emerging high performance pci express serial link protocol for computer and communication applications 
our pci express product solutions include pci e signal switches  clock generators  and re driver and re timer products 
we introduced several analog switch and voltage translation products in very small form factor packages to support cell phone and other portable consumer products 
we expanded our high performance video switch solution with the addition of differential video switches operating at greater than ghz to support hdmi dvi signal switching in digital tv and notebook applications 
we also introduced four low voltage  high frequency cmos lvpecl crystal oscillator product families targeting storage and communication applications 
in fiscal  the company released the first three products of its new pci express bridge and packet switch families for general customer sampling  including one port pci express packet switch and two pci express to pci and pci x bridge products 
in addition the company released samples of five new spread spectrum clock generators and vcxo s targeting lcd projectors  lcd televisions  dlp projectors and set top box applications 
the company also introduced several new frequency control products that incorporate both a crystal resonator and a driver ic into an ultra minature package designed for high density and portable electronic applications 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
we seek to increase unit sales volume through increased wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualification of new foundries  increased number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improved yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
chartered semiconductor manufacturing manufactured approximately   and  of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  magnachip formerly known as hynix manufactured approximately   and of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years   and declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economy of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to reduce unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing  and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices

on october   the company exercised its option to acquire the assets and related liabilities of saronix  llc of menlo park  california 
beginning with the quarter ended december   the company s revenues included revenues from saronix 
for the fiscal year ended june   revenues of million were generated from the sales of saronix products 
for the year ended july   revenues of million were generated from sales of saronix products 
for the year ended july   revenues of million were generated from sales of saronix products 
on september   the company purchased a share of ecera comtek corporation 
beginning with the quarter ended october  the company s revenues included revenues from ecera 
for the year ended july   there was ecera revenue totaling million 
there was no revenue generated from ecera in the fiscal years ended july  and june  the rapid semiconductor industry downturn that began in fiscal caused an over supply of inventories in the global distribution and contract manufacturing channels 
this inventory imbalance pushed order rates down  caused a corresponding drop in backlog  and caused the percentage of net revenues represented by orders placed and shipped in the same quarter to grow 
these orders are called turns orders 
during much of fiscal business conditions in the semiconductor industry improved and the percentage of the company s revenue represented by turns orders declined 
in late fiscal order rates again slowed in response to an imbalance of inventory as compared with end demand  and the percentage of turns orders again increased although not to the levels of integrated circuit order rates in fiscal have subsequently improved  but the company remains heavily reliant on turns orders 
this reliance on turns orders  the uncertain strength of our end markets  and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 
net revenues consist of product sales  which are recognized upon shipment  less an estimate for returns and allowances 
net revenue increased in fiscal versus due to revenue derived from the ecera acquisition that was completed in fiscal  relative improvement in end market demand  and increased acceptance and shipments of the company s new integrated circuit product offerings  particularly in end markets such as cell phones and digital media

we acquired ecera in september and ecera s revenue is principally from customers in taiwan and china 
in addition  an increasing number of shipments are going to asia where an increasing volume of contract manufacturing work is done 
gross profit fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  july  july  june  net revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net revenues gross margin the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to fiscal having revenues and gross profit from ecera beginning september   unit sales volume of our core integrated circuit products improved as a result of end market demand and customer acceptance of the company s new integrated circuit product offerings 
lower gross margin on sales resulted primarily due to lower margins associated with ecera revenue partially offset by a favorable product mix change in our ic product line resulting from a higher percentage of sales of our newer  higher margin integrated circuit products which include analog switch  clock  and connect products 
gross profit in fiscal and fiscal benefited from the sale of inventory that had been previously identified as excess and written down to zero of  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to fiscal had a full year of revenues and gross profit for saronix products whereas fiscal only had nine months  unit sales volume of our core integrated circuit products improved as a result of end market demand and customer acceptance of the company s new integrated circuit product offerings  higher gross margin on sales because of a favorable product 
table of contents mix change resulting from a higher percentage of sales of our newer  higher margin integrated circuit products  reduced cost of sales due to reductions in force in november and february  and gross profit in fiscal included saronix acquisition related inventory and reduction in force costs of  whereas there were no comparable costs in fiscal gross profit in fiscal and fiscal benefited from the sale of previously written off inventory of  and  respectively 
a more favorable mix of the company s higher margin analog switch  clock  and connect products  as well as product cost reductions and a more stable pricing environment drove the improvement in gross margin percentage 
the above improvements were partially offset by an approximately million charge taken in the december quarter to write off inventory obsoleted by a product end of life program  and the inclusion of saronix product sales for one full year in fiscal versus nine months in fiscal since saronix margins are less than the company s total average margins 
future gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on the level and product mix of net revenues 
this includes the mix of sales between lower margin saronix products and our higher margin integrated circuit products 
although we have been successful at favorably improving our integrated circuit product mix and penetrating new end markets  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
accordingly  we are not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  july  july  june  net revenues research and development r d as a percentage of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to personnel and overhead  non recurring engineering charges  and other costs associated with the design  prototyping  testing  manufacturing process support and customer applications support of our products 
the expense decrease in fiscal versus was primarily due to decreased r d wafer fabrication and assembly charges compared to fiscal due to a significant number of our products being re designed and re qualified as a result of chartered semiconductor s closure of one of its fabrication facilities and the required migration of the company s products to another of its fabrication facilities 
these expense decreases were partially offset by  fas r expense in fiscal that was not included in fiscal  and the inclusion of ecera engineering expense resulting from the acquisition and subsequent consolidation of ecera financial results from september  through july   and the continuing ramp up of engineering costs in our pericom taiwan ltd subsidiary 
the expense increase in fiscal versus was primarily due to increased r d wafer fabrication and assembly charges due to a significant number of our products being re designed and re qualified as a result of chartered semiconductor s closure of one of its fabrication facilities and the required migration of the company s products to another of its fabrication facilities  increased mask costs from research and development projects  continuing ramp up of engineering costs in our pericom taiwan ltd subsidiary  and the inclusion of months of saronix engineering expense in fiscal versus nine months in fiscal there was also weeks of expense in fiscal versus weeks in fiscal the company believes that continued spending on research and development to develop new products and improve manufacturing processes is critical to the company s success and  consequently  expects to increase research and development expenses in future periods over the long term 
in the short term  the company intends to continue to focus on cost control until business conditions improve 
if business conditions deteriorate or the rate of improvement does not meet our expectations  the company may implement further cost cutting actions

the expense increase in fiscal versus fiscal is due to the inclusion of ecera sg a expense resulting from the acquisition and subsequent consolidation of ecera financial results from september  through july   and fas r expense which was incurred in fiscal and not in fiscal the above increases were partially offset by decreased distributor representative commissions due to a change in the company s focus product commission structure  decreased professional services primarily resulting from the reversal of accrued audit fees that were not required based upon the termination and final billing for audit related services from the company s former auditor 
the expense increase in fiscal versus fiscal is due to higher sales commission expense due to increased revenues  increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance  inclusion of months of saronix sg a expense in fiscal versus nine months in fiscal  and fiscal had weeks of expense versus weeks in fiscal the above increases were partially offset by a  gain from the sale of a building in ireland in fiscal and the impact of the reductions in force in november and february the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods over the long term due to increased staffing levels  particularly in sales and marketing  as well as increased commission expense to the extent the company achieves higher sales levels 
in the short term  costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance will increase selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company intends to continue to focus on controlling costs until business conditions improve 
if business conditions deteriorate or the rate of improvement does not meet our expectations  the company may implement further cost cutting actions 
restructuring charge in the year ended july  restructuring charges totaled  and was related to a final settlement of an outstanding claim from the february reduction in force described below 
in the year ended july  restructuring charges of  were recorded in connection with a reduction of employee positions 
the eliminated positions were mostly production related  but sales and administrative positions were impacted as well 
the intended effect of this restructuring is to continue the company s outsourcing program  realign the company s sales force to reflect geographic sales changes and revised selling strategy  and to reduce costs 
in the year ended june  there was a restructuring charge of  related to an unused leased facility resulting from our move to our new corporate headquarters 
this restructuring accrual became fully depleted in the first quarter of fiscal  when the lease terminated

there was no minority interest in the year ended june  
table of contents interest income fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  july  july  june  interest income net of interest expense interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of increased interest expense on debt assumed from the ecera acquisition as well as a decline in overall invested capital partially offset by increased returns on investment 
interest income was relatively unchanged between fiscal and fiscal with somewhat increased interest rates being offset by planned capital losses as the portfolio was restructured to achieve better future returns 
provision for income taxes fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands july  july  july  june  pre tax income loss income tax provision benefit effective tax rate our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the effect of foreign income tax and foreign loss  the utilization of research and development tax credits and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
for fiscal the rate was significantly higher than the prior year primarily due to increased profitability 
a reconciliation of our tax rates for fiscal years  and is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report on form k 
for fiscal the rate was very low compared to statutory rates and prior year because relatively small pre tax income of  was almost completely offset by various tax credits 
the income tax benefit in fiscal was million as compared with a benefit of million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower net operating losses in fiscal partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal the provision for income taxes differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the utilization of research and development tax credits and a change in the deferred asset valuation allowance 
equity in net income of investees fiscal year ended change fiscal year ended change in thousands july  july  july  june  equity in net income loss of investee equity in net income of investee is predominantly the company s allocated portion of the net income or losses of pericom technology  inc pti  a british virgin islands corporation based in shanghai  people s republic of china 
pericom and certain pericom shareholders formed pti in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries 
in addition there are other losses realized from other insignificant investments 
the company adopted eitf in the quarter ended december  this adoption did not cause the company to cease recognizing its allocated portion of the net income or losses of pti 
the company s allocated portion of pti s results increased to a profit of million for fiscal from a profit of  for fiscal the increased income in fiscal when compared to fiscal can be primarily be attributed to an improvement in the markets for which it serves 
in addition the company realized net losses from other investments of approximately  in fiscal 
table of contents the company s allocated portion of pti s results declined to a profit of  for fiscal from a profit of  for fiscal due to telecommunications revenue declines as a result of the slowdown in china telecommunications markets that pti serves 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments of approximately million as compared with million as of july  and million as of june  on september  the company purchased of ecera comtek corporation ecera 
the purchase price  including cash consideration of million and assumed debt of approximately million totaled approximately million including transaction costs 
the company also had the right through march  to purchase the remaining of ecera s owned crystal blank manufacturing subsidiary  azer crystal technology co  ltd 
azer 
the company exercised this right to purchase the remaining of azer for cash consideration of approximately million and assumed debt of approximately million on february  in total  approximately million of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was used to complete these acquisitions 
as of july  million is liquid and classified as cash and cash equivalents compared with million as of july  and million as of june  the maturities of the company s short term investments are staggered throughout the year so that cash requirements are met 
since the company is a fabless semiconductor manufacturer  it has lower capital equipment requirements than other semiconductor manufacturers that own fabs 
for fiscal year  the company spent million on property and equipment compared to million and million for fiscal and respectively 
this significant increase in spending on property and equipment is primarily attributable to additional investment in ecera to increase production capacity within our manufacturing operations 
interest rates have continued to trend upwards as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board 
the company generated approximately million of interest income for the fiscal year ended july  compared to million and million in fiscal years ended july  and june   respectively 
in the longer term the company may generate less interest income if its total invested balance decreases and these decreases are not offset by rising interest rates or increased cash generated from operations or other sources 
the company s net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million in fiscal was primarily a result of net income of million  a million decrease in inventories  million increase in deferred income taxes  million of stock based compensation  and depreciation and amortization of million  which were partially off set by million of non cash equity in net income of the company s unconsolidated subsidiaries  and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in inventories  and accounts receivable is primarily attributed to the acquisition of ecera s operations 
the increase in stock based compensation is the result of the company implementing fas r 
in fiscal  the company s net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily the result of net income of  a million decrease in inventories  depreciation and amortization of million  which were partially off set by a decrease in accounts payable of million  and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is the result of a decrease in the accounts receivable allowance of approximately million 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the reserves for returned product at july  as compared with june  at june   the accounts receivable allowance included reserves for the return of product from terminated distributors as well as for the return of product associated with the product end of life program then underway 
on july   there were no terminated distributors in the process of returning product and there was no product end of life program underway 
the reduction in net inventories during the fiscal year ended july  was largely due to inventory written off as well as a result of a concerted effort to reduce inventory levels to a lower level in fiscal year the decrease in accounts payable during this period was the result of routine period to period fluctuations 
in fiscal year  the company s net cash provided by operating activities of  was primarily due to net losses of million  a million increase in deferred income taxes and a million increase in inventories which were partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
these are net of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of saronix llc 
the increase in inventories and accounts payable are primarily due to the growth in our operation 
generally  as sales levels rise  the company expects inventories  accounts receivable and accounts payable to increase 
however  there will be routine fluctuations in these accounts from period to period that may be significant in amount 

table of contents the company s net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to net cash paid for the ecera and azer acquisition totaling million  and additions to property and equipment totaling million 
this was partially offset by maturities of short term investments exceeding purchases by million

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
fin requires additional annual disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces apb no 
and sfas no 
and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
apb no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle 
sfas no

on july  and will apply its provisions on a prospective basis when applicable 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin as of july  did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at july   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of july   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
