item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are a leading provider of internet audience measurement and analysis in the united states and around the world 
all of our products and services are designed to assist companies in making critical business decisions regarding their internet strategies and initiatives 
we have a highly diversified and global client base  including large and small companies in the media  technology  advertising  financial services  consumer products  retail and travel industries 
vnu nv  through its subsidiaries acnielsen corporation and nielsen media research  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  our revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
as of december   we had  clients  compared to  clients as of december  and  clients as of december  the increases in our revenues and number of clients during the last few years are the result of both acquisitions that we have completed  as well as organic growth in our product portfolio 
we expect our revenues and client base to continue to grow as i our newer products gain marketplace acceptance  ii we develop and sell additional products and services to new and existing clients  iii we launch our products and services in new international territories  iv we generate price increases for our existing products and services and v we expand our patent licensing program 
we have incurred operating losses and net losses since our inception  and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since the beginning of  however  we have made significant progress in reducing our annual operating loss and annual net loss 
our operating loss decreased from million in to million in  to million in and to million in likewise  our net loss decreased from million in to million in  to million in and to million in our ability to reduce our operating and net losses  and our belief that we will make further progress in reducing such losses in  is attributable to a number of factors 
first  we expect the revenue growth we have experienced in the past few years to continue 
second  a significant initial investment was required to launch certain of our services in and  including our megapanel services  and while the ongoing expense to operate such services will continue  we expect such expenses to be less than the initial expenses required to launch such services 
in addition  because we offer syndicated panel services and are able to utilize our existing databases to expand our custom analytical offerings  our revenue growth does not require a corresponding increase in our expenses 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  which we believe is sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
industry trends the success of our business depends heavily on the continued expansion of the internet for advertising  commerce and communications 
internet advertising  e commerce and the number of people using the internet  particularly through the use of internet broadband connections  have dramatically increased in recent years  and we expect this growth to continue in upcoming years around the world 
these growth trends have made the internet an increasingly important component of companies overall business strategies 
as a result  companies conducting business online are increasingly seeking analysis and insights to i define and reach their target audiences  ii measure the effectiveness of their advertising and marketing strategies  iii benchmark their performance with their competitors and iv increase brand equity and commerce revenue 
companies are also increasingly recognizing that  compared with other media  the internet allows online market participants to obtain a unique understanding of consumer behavior 
unlike with other forms of advertising  including print  radio and television  advertisers can i target advertising in an unprecedented manner  ii confirm whether consumers have actually viewed advertisements and when and iii decipher whether consumers have taken certain actions  whether completing a purchase or visiting a web site  and understand exactly why 
because of the unique dynamics of the internet  we expect that internet advertising and commerce will not only continue to grow in coming years  but that internet advertising and commerce will garner a larger percentage of total advertising and commerce dollars 
we believe that this growth will require a commensurate increase in internet media and market research  and that we are particularly well suited to address the global needs of online participants 
product portfolio our goal for the last few years has been to offer the most comprehensive global portfolio of internet media and market research products and services 
in order to reach this goal  we have focused on both strategic acquisitions in the united states and abroad and investing in new products to meet changing marketplace needs 
as a result of these efforts  we currently offer a wide range of products and services in the united states and in many countries throughout europe  asia pacific and latin america 
we believe that this product portfolio and breadth of coverage will enable us to continue to increase our client base  increase our ability to sell multiple products to clients and increase the total sales to individual clients 
in the first half of  we acquired adrelevance  our online advertising expenditure service  and plan  which provides demographic  lifestyle and product preference information 
during  we also made strategic acquisitions designed to expand our netview service around the world  which provides detailed panel based internet audience information 
these included our acquisition of netvalue sa  an international provider of internet audience measurement services  and the purchase from acnielsen corporation of the interest in acnielsen eratings 
com that we did not already own 
since the beginning of  we acquired lemonad now branded adrelevance  our international online advertising measurement service  and red sheriff  a global provider of site centric based internet audience measurement tools 
in conjunction with these strategic acquisitions  we have also devoted significant resources to internal product development 
our key new products and services include i megapanel  which includes our vertical offerings  such as megaview financial  megaview retail  megaview search  megaview travel and megaview local  and ii homescan online  a joint product with acnielsen that combines offline consumer purchasing data with internet audience measurement data 
we believe these new products and services  as well as additional megapanel offerings  will be important to our financial performance over the next few years 
revenue overview we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our internet media and market research products and services  which include both syndicated products and customized products 
syndicated products currently represent a significant majority of our total revenues  and our goal is for syndicated products to continue to represent a significant majority of our total revenues 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our patents 
in france  japan and latin america  we offer many of our services through strategic relationships with leading local market research and information services companies 
we currently own of netratings japan  our japanese subsidiary  while the remaining ownership interest is owned by transcosmos  dentsu 
com and other investors 
we currently own of mediametrie netratings  our french subsidiary  and the remainder is owned by mediametrie 
we currently own of ibope eratings 
com  our latin american joint venture  and the remainder is owned by ibope 
netratings uses the equity method to account for its investment in ibope eratings 
com 
in each of these locations  revenue is allocated between netratings and the subsidiary or joint venture company depending on the location of the customer and the location of the panel whose data is used in the service 
as a result of the red sheriff acquisition  we also obtained a ownership interest in an italian company  red sheriff srl  which offers site centric based services in italy 
on february   we purchased the remaining of red sheriff srl  and we subsequently renamed the company netratings italia srl as a result of this acquisition  we have consolidated the operating results of netratings italia in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the second quarter of we have experienced revenue growth in each of the years since we launched our first product in  as demonstrated by the table below years ended december revenues in thousands we expect our revenues to exceed our revenues  primarily as a result of sales from our new products and services  price increases for our existing products and services and the launch of our new and existing products and services in new international territories 
in addition  in the first half of we decided to launch a program to enforce our intellectual property rights against various companies that compete against us in the internet technology fields 
as a result of this program  we will recognize patent licensing revenue in critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of receivables  the valuation of fixed assets  goodwill  intangible assets  including depreciable lives assigned  marketable securities and income taxes  as well as the estimates and judgments relating to the valuation of certain liabilities  including restructuring liabilities  service periods for stock awards with performance criteria  and contingencies and litigation 
our management bases its estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgment regarding the collectibility of those fees 
we sell a majority of our products and services pursuant to one year subscription agreements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our subscription products and services and our custom products and services ratably over the term of the agreement 
invoiced amounts are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
if a contract s collectibility comes into question  revenue recognition is discontinued until collectibility is reasonably assured 
this determination is based on management s judgment and could adversely affect both revenue and deferred revenue 
we also generate revenue from the licensing of our patents and record the revenue in accordance with the four basic criteria of sab listed above 
accounting for stock based compensation we measure compensation expenses for our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and 
under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of apb no 
 stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the difference between the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date less the amount  if any  that the employee is required to pay under the award  and is recognized as expense over the vesting period using the accelerated method 
bad debt we manage credit risk on accounts receivable by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  reviewing our accounts and contracts and by providing appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make contractually required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances are based on management s judgment which considers historical experience and specific knowledge of accounts that may not be collectible 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual case 
losses are recognized for legal contingencies when both the probability of occurrence and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategy related to legal proceedings 
goodwill and intangible assets our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we retain an independent appraisal firm that annually provides a valuation of our company s fair value  based on discounted cash flow and comparable company analyses 
the cash flow analysis requires significant judgment and estimates by management relating to assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates 
an impairment loss is recorded if the estimated future cash flows plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
our estimate of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model and changes in operating performance 
an impairment loss recorded in the future  if any  could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill and intangibles as of october  at which time no impairment was indicated 
there has been no indication of impairment since october  restructuring we have engaged in  and may continue to engage in  restructuring actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures 
these restructuring actions and activities require us to make estimates related to severance and other employee separation costs and the ability to generate sublease income 
we accrue severance restructuring costs in a period provided the following criteria are met management commits to a plan of termination prior to the date of the financial statements and establishes the benefit employees will receive  the benefit arrangement is either communicated to employees  or part of a pre established or legally required benefit  the plan of termination specifically identifies the number and job classifications of employees to be terminated  and the plan of termination will be completed in a reasonably short period of time such that significant changes are unlikely 
the amounts we have accrued represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur in connection with these actions  but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations in certain international jurisdictions 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
income taxes estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from net operating losses  tax carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of domestic and international jurisdictions 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a charge to expenses would result

in the first quarter of  we purchased an additional million shares of stock for approximately million 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total the expected timing of payment of the purchase obligations set forth above  which consist primarily of panel and data center costs  is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
while we have historically made additional contributions to our majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures  we are not contractually required to make such contributions 
in the event of a request for a capital infusion  we have the option as to whether or not we participate in the round of funding 
should we elect not to participate  our equity position would be diluted in that joint venture 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  although we could elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item of regulation s k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million consisting of cash and highly liquid  short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december   our investments had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
declines of interest rates over time will reduce our interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and  accordingly  could adversely affect our net income and earnings per share 
for example  if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of our total investment portfolio would decrease increase by approximately million 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  time to maturity one year or less one to five years five to ten years greater than ten years total in thousands  except percent data unaudited cash and cash equivalents average interest rates marketable securities average interest rates marketable securities with a maturity date greater than one year and in a loss position as of december  are reported as long term marketable securities on the balance sheet 
all other marketable securities are reported as short term marketable securities 
netratings historically adjusted its equity investments in ibope eratings 
com and red sheriff srl based on its share of the net gains losses recorded by these joint ventures 
at december   ibope eratings 
com and red sheriff srl were accounted for under the equity method 
as a result of the losses incurred by ibope eratings 
com  the balance in our investment in and our outstanding advances to ibope eratings 
com were zero as of march   and therefore no losses have been recorded since the first quarter of we have no obligation to make additional investments in ibope eratings 
com 
on february   we purchased the remaining of red sheriff srl subsequently renamed netratings italia srl that we did not already own thereby increasing our ownership to of the company 
this resulted in netratings italia s operating results being reported in our consolidated results rather than in equity in earnings of joint ventures 
revenues from outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our total revenues in both and these international sales are typically denominated in the local currency of the relevant country  and the international expenses are also primarily incurred in the local currency 
when we consolidate the financial results of our foreign operations  our financial results could be positively or negatively affected depending on changes in the relevant currency exchange rates 
as a result  our financial results could be adversely affected by unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates did not materially impact our net loss in or we have not entered into hedging transactions in order to mitigate the risk from currency fluctuations  but we might consider using currency forward contracts or other financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risk if it is determined by us that such instruments are appropriate to reduce currency risk
