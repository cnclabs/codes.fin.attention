business description and overview spectralink commenced operations in april to design  manufacture and sell unlicensed wireless telephone communication systems for businesses 
our product portfolio consists of two types of product categories  differentiated by the wireless technologies implemented into the product the link wireless telephone system and netlink wireless telephones 
link uses a proprietary radio infrastructure in the mhz radio band targeted to organizations that desire a dedicated wireless voice solution for their on premises mobile workforce 
the netlink wireless telephone products operate over ieee compliant wireless local area networks wlans in the mhz frequency band using standards based internet protocol ip technology 
netlink products are targeted to organizations that want both a wireless voice and wireless data solution on a single network 
spectralink also offers an open application interface oai  which enables third party messaging applications to be integrated with our wireless telephones 
because of the recent advances in wireless local area network wlan technology  a significant portion of our development efforts will focus on our existing netlink products as well as new products that operate on a wlan 
on january   spectralink corporation and spectralink denmark aps acquired all of the stock of kirk telecom a s and its subsidiaries for million danish kroner approximately million in cash excluding acquisition related costs 
as a result of the acquisition  kirk telecom became a wholly owned subsidiary of spectralink denmark aps 
we used a combination of cash provided by debt and million of our own cash for the transaction 
kirk telecom is based in horsens  denmark and designs  manufactures and sells unlicensed wireless telephone systems using the dect standard 
in addition  kirk telecom offers the kirk serial in out sio to enable third party messaging applications to interface with its telephone systems 
with the addition of kirk telecom s dect based products  we now offer a complete product portfolio that incorporates all major enterprise wireless voice technologies wi fi  dect and proprietary systems 
our acquisition of kirk telecom also significantly increases our international reach and augments our distribution channels and geographical market penetration  further extending our leadership in workplace wireless telephony 
furthermore  the acquisition enables us to compete in new small to medium business markets in north america with kirk telecom s dect products 
for the year ended december   we achieved the highest levels of annual revenue and earnings in our history 
our revenue was million  and earnings per diluted share were on net income of million 
this represents a growth in year over year revenue and a increase in year over year net income 
in comparison  for the year ended december   net income was million  or earnings per diluted share  on revenue of million 
the results of kirk telecom s operations will be included in our results of operations starting january  when they are included  the kirk telecom s operations will significantly impact our sales  cost of sales  and operating expenses 
unless specifically indicated  disclosures in this form k relate to spectralink as a stand alone entity and do not reflect the impact of acquiring kirk telecom 

table of contents our revenue growth in early was adversely affected in the first half of the year by the acquisition of airespace  a manufacturer of network access points  by one our competitors 
as several of our oem partners used airespace as their access point provider  the acquisition disrupted the market while our oem partners sought out and certified new access point vendors  thereby slowing sales of our products 
new access point provider relationships with our oem partners were substantially completed by the beginning of the third quarter of and we saw our sales to our oems return to more normal levels in the second half of in  our traditional distribution channels were responsible for approximately of product sales  original equipment manufacturer oem partners contributed approximately of product sales  and the balance of was met through our direct sales organization 
in our target vertical markets  million in revenue or of product sales was derived from product sales to the healthcare sector  million in revenue or of product sales was derived from product sales to the retail sector  and the remaining million in revenue or of product sales was derived from product sales to other vertical markets including industrial  government and corporate 
international revenue was approximately million  or of total revenue  in international revenue increased more than in compared to revenue growth in was primarily due to a year over year increase of approximately million or in netlink product sales  and a year over year increase of approximately million or in service revenue 
for the second time in our history  fourth quarter sales of our netlink wireless telephones surpassed sales of our link wireless telephone systems 
specifically  in the fourth quarter netlink sales delivered million  or  of product revenue 
for the year  netlink sales accounted for of product revenue or million 
although netlink sales grew faster in than sales for the company as a whole  we continue to experience fluctuations in product mix on a quarter to quarter basis 
sales of link wireless telephone systems for the year accounted for of product sales  or million in revenue 
in  we introduced an improved link handset that included a backlit display and keypad 
our overall gross margin was for the year compared to in factors that impact gross margin are sales through our oem partners and product mix 
we realize lower margins on products sold through oem relationships because of the pricing arrangements inherent in these relationships 
our link product line gross margin is approximately higher than the aggregate gross margin from the sale of the netlink products because of the added infrastructure associated with link sales 
we are continuing our transition from a north american oriented niche market provider to a global supplier of workplace wireless systems with our recent acquisition of kirk telecom as well as our partnerships with some of the largest telecommunications manufacturers worldwide including nortel  alcatel  avaya  inter tel  and nec america 
because our oem partners primarily sell netlink wireless telephones  if oem sales increase  we would expect netlink revenue to also increase 
during  we paid our second full year of quarterly cash dividends of per share to our stockholders totaling million 
we have discontinued paying a quarterly dividend and we will use that cash to retire the debt incurred with the kirk telecom acquisition 
in addition  our covenants in the credit facility prevent us from declaring any dividends or repurchasing our stock 
when we initiated paying the dividend  we stated that our intention was to pay a quarterly dividend until there was a strategic change in our company that we determined would better utilize our cash 
we have made the strategic determination to use cash to fund the acquisition of kirk telecom 
we repurchased  shares of company stock for million during through our repurchase program  leaving a balance of million shares of outstanding common stock still authorized for repurchase as of december  under our credit facility  we are restricted from paying dividends or repurchasing shares under the repurchase program 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec  have increased our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some activities  like sec reporting obligations  more expensive and difficult 
for instance  in seeking to comply with section management s internal controls and procedures for financial reporting of the sarbanes oxley act of  we spent approximately  and  respectively in outside services associated with documenting  testing and audits of our internal controls during and  respectively 
the total of cash  cash equivalents and investments as of december   was million compared to million as of december  in addition  current assets reflects million held in escrow pursuant to the stock purchase agreement to acquire kirk telecom  which escrow was paid to the kirk telecom shareholders on january   upon the closing of the stock purchase agreement in accordance with its terms 
we continue to invest our available cash in low risk instruments including government securities and tax free investments

table of contents we have funded our operations since inception with cash provided by operations  supplemented by equity financing and leases on capital equipment 
as of december   we had  of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in marketable securities 
in addition  current assets reflects million held in escrow pursuant to the stock purchase agreement to acquire kirk telecom  which escrow was paid to the kirk telecom shareholders on january   upon the closing of the stock purchase agreement in accordance with its terms 
on december   we incurred debt of million under a million bank credit facility to fund the acquisition of kirk telecom 
as part of the share purchase agreement  spectralink was required to escrow a specified amount of the purchase price for the stock approximately million from the date the parties executed the stock purchase agreement december  until the closing of the transaction which occurred on january  the remaining purchase price of approximately million was placed in escrow as a holdback 
during  we generated cash from operations of  consisting principally of net income of  the increase in cash from operating activities in compared to primarily relates to higher net income and a smaller increase in trade accounts receivable in as of december   our trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso was days compared to days as of december  this increase in dso was due to higher oem sales which have longer payment terms 
as oem sales increase  we expect our dso to trend up 
the increase in inventory relates to oem demands for higher volume  an expanding product mix  and manufacturing and distribution pipeline requirements 
in  investing activities used cash of  which was primarily the result of  placed in escrow in accordance with terms stated in the stock purchase agreement entered into by us on december   to acquire kirk telecom  offset by million from the sale of investments 
we also used  for purchases of marketable securities and  for purchases of property and equipment primarily related to purchases for the expansion of our peoplesoft erp system as well as computer equipment  software  research equipment  and manufacturing tooling and molds 
our investments in marketable securities consist of available for sale and held to maturity securities invested in municipal bond funds and government securities 
cash from financing activities provided  of cash during  which was primarily a result of the borrowing on our credit facility dated december   of  and proceeds of  received from common stock option exercises and issuances of common stock through the employee stock purchase program 
these cash inflows were offset by payment of four quarterly cash dividends totaling  and purchases of  shares of the outstanding common stock now classified as treasury stock at a cost of  we are prohibited from declaring dividends in the future under the terms of the credit facility or repurchasing our stock 
on december  we entered into a credit facility the credit facility with a group of banks to provide funds for the acquisition of kirk in note 
the credit facility consists of a three year term loan of  and a revolving line of credit for borrowings up to  of which  becomes available as of july  that also matures in three years 
we can borrow at either the jp morgan prime rate plus or at a libo rate plus 
at december   our interest was the jp morgan prime plus 
interest expense of approximately  related to the credit facility was accrued in other accrued expenses as of december  the amount available for borrowings under the revolving line of credit will be determined based on the borrowing base calculation as defined in the credit facility beginning with the month ending may  as of december   approximately  was outstanding on the line of credit and there was approximately  available for additional borrowings under the line of credit 
amounts due under the credit facility are secured by a first security interest in substantially all of our assets 
according to the credit facility  we are obligated to pay annual commitment fees of up to a maximum of of the unused amount of the revolving credit line 
the credit facility may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
commencing with the fiscal year ended december   we are required to prepay term borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to percent of excess cash flow  as defined in the credit facility  for such fiscal year 
each prepayment shall be made within days after the end of such fiscal year 
as of december   we did not have excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility  therefore no prepayment on the term loan is required to be paid in under the credit facility  we are required to comply with certain financial and non financial covenants 
among the financial covenants are requirements related to consolidated net worth  a quarterly leverage ratio and a quarterly fixed charge ratio 
the credit facility also limits our ability to enter into secured and unsecured borrowing arrangements  issue dividends to stockholders we were permitted to pay a dividend in december  repurchase our stock  acquire and dispose of businesses  make capital expenditures  and issue additional shares of our stock  among other requirements  as defined in the credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to the credit facility at december  and as of the date of filing this form k 
at december   we have reflected  of amounts drawn down under the credit facility as a current liability 
it is management s intent to repay the required principal payments on the term loan totaling  and  on the credit facility 
in february  we made a payment of  applied to the term loan which was funded by our available cash 

table of contents we incurred debt acquisition costs of approximately  related to the credit facility and are amortizing the costs over the term of the credit facility  which is three years 
amortization of debt acquisition costs was  for the year ended december  to the extent we prepay our debt  the amortization of debt issuance costs will also be accelerated 
there were no off balance sheet financing arrangements  unconsolidated subsidiaries  commitments or guarantees  except as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity at december   was  which represented of total assets 
as of december   we had working capital of  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital of  occurred primarily from the sale of long term investments in marketable securities and borrowings from long term debt for cash placed in escrow for the anticipated acquisition of kirk telecom 
as of december   our current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  compared with a current ratio of as of december  excluding our cash held in escrow in anticipation of our acquisition of kirk telecom  our current ratio as of december  was we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities including those acquired from kirk telecom and cash generated from operations will be sufficient  based on our presently anticipated needs  to fund necessary capital expenditures  to provide adequate working capital  to repay debt when it is due  and to finance our expansion for the foreseeable future next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  when required by us 
if additional funds were to be raised through the sale of equity securities  additional dilution to the existing stockholders would be likely to result 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have various commitments and contingencies including noncancelable leases  interest and principal repayments related to our credit facility  purchase commitments  guarantees and other commitments as described below we have entered into leases for facilities under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through we have other obligations for office equipment that expire at various dates through total rent expense for noncancelable  cancelable and month to month operating leases for the years ended december   and  was approximately   and  respectively 
in november  we renegotiated four of our existing leases for facilities located in boulder  colorado for various dates through we also renewed the lease in empalme  sonora  mexico where final assembly of our products occurs through august and we entered into an additional lease of another facility in boulder  colorado for manufacturing operations 
the manufacturing facility lease included a provision whereby no rent payments are due for the first months 
however  we will normalize the lease payments over the life of the term of the lease 
following the rent abatement period  three months of prepaid rent will be applied 
the first monthly rent payment is scheduled for december  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company records monthly rent expense equal to the total of the payments due over the lease term  divided by the number of months of the lease term 
the difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged as deferred rent obligation  which will be reflected in long term liabilities and other accrued expenses in the balance sheet 
we have stated interest and principal commitments related to the credit facility as described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we enter into various purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as goods and services  in the normal course of business 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders with delivery dates from six to twelve months from the purchase date  and in certain cases  purchase orders that contain non cancelable non returnable terms and conditions associated with these purchase arrangements 
we are committed to accept delivery of such materials pursuant to such purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such orders 
such orders may or may not include cancellation costs payable by us 
in the past  we have been required to take delivery of materials from suppliers that were in excess of demand requirements and we have previously recognized charges and expenses related to such excess material  related primarily to engineering changes 
if we are not able to adequately manage our supply chain and adjust such commitments for changes in demand  we may incur additional inventory expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory 
such expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also have a commitment to a vendor related to the implementation of an erp system which is included in purchase commitments 

table of contents we enter into various license agreements  some of which require royalty payments and non refundable licensing fees 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we incurred expenses of approximately   and  for license and other fees relating to these agreements 
we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas  accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements 
as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows in thousands thereafter total operating leases purchase commitments principal payments on credit facility interest payments on credit facility other obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments dependence on suppliers we rely on sole or limited sources of supply for many components and equipment used in our manufacturing process 
the delay  inability  or refusal of any of these suppliers to ship these components or equipment or the inability to modify components in a timely basis to comply with environmental directives could interrupt our manufacturing process and ability to manufacture products in a timely manner to meet customer demand 
the limited number of sources for many of these components may also prevent us from decreasing our reliance on certain suppliers and finding other sources at competitive prices 
unforeseen price increases by any of the sole or limited source suppliers could negatively impact product margins and our financial performance 
commitment to pay certain termination benefits under employment agreements as of december   we have entered into employment agreements with certain international employees 
under each of the agreements  in the event employment is terminated other than voluntarily by the employee or by us for cause or upon the death of the employee  we are committed to pay certain benefits  including specified monthly severance 
we believe our existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commercial commitments and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our reported financial position and results of operations depends 
we determined the critical accounting principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 

table of contents our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  receivables  product warranty obligations  inventories and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or assumptions in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table presents information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors sales and deferred revenue collectibility is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered and seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of invoiced amounts based upon our assessment of the ability of the customer to pay 
we determine whether collectibility is reasonably assured based on the customer s current financial condition and on possible credit deterioration  the indirect and oem channels ability to sell through the products purchased and the relationship we have with our customers 
customer ability to pay customer ability to sell to end user our revenue recognition policy is based on complex and dynamic rules established by the securities and exchange commission and other governing bodies 
these rules require us to make judgments with regard to post delivery obligations 
when significant post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled or until we have established sufficient history to estimate the cost of our obligation 

table of contents financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors accounts receivable collectibility of invoiced amounts estimating the collectibility of accounts receivable requires us to make judgments about the credit quality and economic viability of customers based on information available to us 
we use information available at the time of credit issuance  such as dunn bradstreet credit report  payment history  or financial information provided by the customer 
for ongoing customers and past due balances  we have discussions with our customers to determine if economic conditions have deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
historical experience regarding payment history customer creditworthiness monitoring collections and payments from customers deterioration of customer s economic condition after date of invoice changes in credit loss rates from historical rates used financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors cost of goods sold and inventories obsolete  unmarketable or excess inventory estimating obsolete  unmarketable or excess inventory requires us to forecast future demand and market conditions 
changes in our product strategy can result in obsolete inventory 
we base our estimate on the difference between the cost of held inventory and the expected market value of the inventory 
product lifecycle evaluation of customer demand for various product types analysis of inventory on hand with no estimated future demand from customer base 
table of contents financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets we are required to estimate whether recoverability of deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the related tax jurisdictions 
we use historical and projected future operating results  including a review of the eligible carryforward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
tax law changes variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors warranty warranty obligations estimating warranty liability requires us to forecast  using historical data as a basis  future product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs 
we base our estimate on historical and current trends of product failure rates  repair cost per unit and service delivery costs 
we have contractual commitments to various customers that require us to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect 
historically we have not experienced significant costs related to epidemic failure 
costs would be accrued for an epidemic defect when an epidemic defect is identified and the costs of repair can be reasonably estimated 
monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers actual historical return rates at the time of sale and updating estimates throughout the warranty period monitoring our customer base for possible epidemic defects estimated failure rates  repair costs per unit  and service delivery costs in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
revisions to any of the discussed estimates  or other non critical items  could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued or proposed accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
in april  the securities and exchange commission made an amendment to rule a regarding the compliance date for sfas r  which requires the company to adopt sfas r on january  under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the 
table of contents transition method to be used at date of adoption 
we have chosen to use the modified prospective method of adoption and are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and the effect of adopting sfas r 
under that method  we will recognize compensation costs for new grants of share based awards  awards modified after the effective date  and the remaining portion of the unvested awards on january  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas as described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in june  we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested options to minimize the recognition of compensation costs in future periods for previously granted but unvested awards 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable 
this statement also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements 
sfas replaces apb opinion  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are subject to market risk due to changes in united states interest rates 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure from currency rate fluctuations of danish kroner  related to our anticipated acquisition of kirk telecom 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  the purchase price was to be payable in danish kroner at the closing 
the forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and the carrying amount of the forward contracts is the fair value  which is determined by obtaining quoted market prices  and recognized as either assets or liabilities 
changes in fair value of forward contracts are recognized in other income loss  net at the end of each period 
the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts at december  was a liability of  as of december   unrealized losses from the changes in the fair value of these forward contracts was  and was included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations

in addition  current assets reflects million held in escrow pursuant to the stock purchase agreement to acquire kirk telecom  which escrow was paid to the kirk telecom shareholders on january   upon closing of the stock purchase agreement in accordance with its terms 
we have completed a market risk sensitivity analysis of these cash and cash equivalents based on an assumed point change in interest rates 
if market rates had increased or decreased point during the year ended december   our interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately  as of december   the primary interest rate risk is related to our borrowings under our credit facility

we borrowed million under the credit facility as of december  as of february   we had million outstanding under the credit facility 
on march   we elected to base the variable interest rate of our credit facility on the eurodollar rate  which is libo plus 
based upon expected levels of borrowings under the credit facility in  an increase in variable interest rates of basis points would have an effect on the our annual results of operations and cash flows of approximately million 
in addition  we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to the acquisition of kirk telecom  we will increase our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and the risks associated therein 
we have entered into limited forward currency contracts but we have not historically engaged in any hedging activities relating to our non us dollar operations  and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates
