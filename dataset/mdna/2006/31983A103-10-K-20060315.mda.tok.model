all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report  including statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are  or may be deemed to be  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act 
as discussed below  the financial statements  footnotes  schedules and discussion within this report have been reformatted to conform to the presentation required for discontinued operations pursuant to the company s sale of its mortgage banking subsidiary 
executive overview first community bancshares  inc is a bank holding company which provides commercial banking services and has positioned itself as a regional community bank and a financial services alternative to larger banks which often provide less emphasis on personal relationships  and smaller community banks which lack the capital and resources to efficiently serve customer needs 
the company has focused its growth efforts on building financial partnerships and more enduring and complete relationships with businesses and individuals through a very personal approach to banking and financial services 
the company and its operations are guided by a strategic plan which includes growth through acquisitions and through office expansion in new market areas including strategically identified metro markets in virginia  west virginia  north carolina and tennessee 
while the company s mission remains that of a community bank  management believes that entry into new markets will accelerate the company s growth rate by diversifying the demographics of its customer base and customer prospects and by generally increasing its sales and service network 
despite strong competition  the company has succeeded in establishing new offices in seven new market areas including four new loan production offices in the last year and three new full service offices since the second quarter of the company has also completed two bank acquisitions and one wealth management acquisition since january and has grown total assets by over the last two years and over the last four years 
the company continues its pursuit of community banking partners and is progressing with plans for new offices within its established target markets 
additional details regarding recent acquisitions and expansion are included under the heading recent acquisitions and branching activity 

table of contents economy throughout  short term market interest rates increased significantly  while long term market rates remained largely unchanged 
those changes have resulted in a flat interest rate curve  an environment that has led to compression of net interest margins 
the local economies in which the company operates are diverse and cover the majority portion of a four state region 
west virginia and southwest virginia continue to benefit from increasing crude oil prices 
these economies have significant exposure to extractive industries  such as coal and natural gas  which become more active and lucrative when oil prices rise 
the local economies in the central portion of north carolina have suffered in recent years due to foreign competition in both furniture and textiles as well as consolidation in the financial services industry 
despite these detractions  the economies in this region continue to benefit from strong real estate development  good commercial occupancy rates and national companies relocating and expanding in the triad and central piedmont areas 
the eastern virginia local economies are experiencing strong growth in residential and commercial development as those areas continue to benefit from a wide array of corporate activities and relocations 
competitive focus as the company competes for increased market share and growth in both loans and deposits it continues to encounter strong competition from many sources 
bank expansion through de novo branches and loan production offices has grown in popularity as a means of reaching out to new markets 
many of the markets targeted by the company are also being entered by other banks in nearby markets and  in some cases  from more distant markets 
despite strong competition from other banks  credit unions and mortgage companies  the company has seen success in newly established offices in winston salem as well as other markets in both virginia and north carolina 
the company attributes this measure of success to its recruitment of local  established bankers and loan personnel in those targeted markets 
competitive forces do impact the company through pressure on interest yields  product fees and loan structure and terms  however  the company has countered these pressures with its relationship style and pricing and a disciplined approach to loan underwriting 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary principally when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded based upon the probability of occurrence of a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated by management primarily through the use of internal modeling techniques and appraisal estimates 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following is a summary of the company s more subjective and complex critical accounting policies 
in addition  the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified i 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses  ii 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets  and iii 
accounting for income taxes as the accounting areas 
table of contents that require the most subjective or complex judgments 
derivatives hedging practices were previously included  but were eliminated in august in connection with the disposition of the company s mortgage banking subsidiary 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio and is based on management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
in june  the company reclassified thousand of its allowance for loan losses to a separate allowance for lending related commitments  which is included in other liabilities 
estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  plans for problem loan resolution  the opinions of the company s regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information 
also included in management s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events  the outcome of which are uncertain 
these events may include  but are not limited to  a general slowdown in the economy  fluctuations in overall lending rates  political conditions  legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry  and economic conditions affecting specific geographic areas in which the company conducts business 
the company determines the allowance for loan losses by making specific allocations to impaired loans and loan pools that exhibit inherent weaknesses and various credit risk factors 
allocations to loan pools are developed giving weight to risk ratings  historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors 
these factors may include  among others  actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  and the impact of government regulations 
the foregoing analysis is performed by management to evaluate the portfolio and calculate an estimated valuation allowance through a quantitative and qualitative analysis that applies risk factors to those identified risk areas 
this risk management evaluation is applied at both the portfolio level and the individual loan level for commercial loans and credit relationships while the level of consumer and residential mortgage loan allowance is determined primarily on a total portfolio level based on a review of historical loss percentages and other qualitative factors including concentrations  industry specific factors and economic conditions 
the commercial portfolio requires more specific analysis of individually significant loans and the borrower s underlying cash flow  business conditions  capacity for debt repayment and the valuation of secondary sources of payment  such as collateral 
this analysis may result in specifically identified weaknesses and corresponding specific impairment allowances 
the use of various estimates and judgments in the company s ongoing evaluation of the required level of allowance can significantly impact the company s results of operations and financial condition and may result in either greater provisions against earnings to increase the allowance or reduced provisions based upon management s current view of portfolio and economic conditions and the application of revised estimates and assumptions 
acquisitions and intangible assets the company may  from time to time  engage in business combinations with other companies 
the acquisition of a business is generally accounted for under purchase accounting rules promulgated by the fasb 
purchase accounting requires the recording of underlying assets and liabilities of the entity acquired at their fair market value 
any excess of the purchase price of the business over the net assets acquired and any identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
fair values are assigned based on quoted prices for similar assets  if readily available  or appraisal by qualified independent parties for relevant asset and liability categories 
financial assets and liabilities are typically valued using discount models which apply current discount rates to streams of cash flow 
all of these valuation methods require the use of assumptions which can result in alternate valuations and varying levels of goodwill and  in some cases  amortization expense or accretion income 
management must also make estimates of useful or economic lives of certain acquired assets and liabilities 
these lives are used in establishing amortization and accretion of some intangible assets and liabilities  such as the intangible associated with core deposits acquired in the acquisition of a commercial bank 

table of contents goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price  if any  over the fair value of the revalued net assets 
goodwill is tested at least annually in the month of november for possible impairment 
this testing again uses a discounted cash flow model applied to the anticipated stream of cash flows from operations of the business or segment being tested 
impairment testing necessarily uses estimates in the form of growth and attrition rates  anticipated rates of return  and discount rates 
these estimates have a direct bearing on the results of the impairment testing and serve as the basis for management s conclusions as to impairment 
income taxes the establishment of provisions for federal and state income taxes is a complex area of accounting which also involves the use of judgments and estimates in applying relevant tax statutes 
the company operates in multiple state tax jurisdictions and this requires the appropriate allocation of income and expense to each state based on a variety of apportionment or allocation bases 
management strives to keep abreast of changes in tax law and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
the company is also subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities 
results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from company estimates and provisions 
the company continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of possible exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
the company recently completed a state tax audit 
the results of that audit are discussed under the heading results of operations income tax expense 
recent acquisitions and branching activity on december   the company completed the sale of its clifton forge  virginia  branch location to sonabank  n 
a 
the sale included deposits and repurchase agreements totaling approximately million and loans of approximately million 
the transaction resulted in an approximate million pre tax gain on sale 
the company has plans to open five de novo branches  convert three loan production offices to full service locations  and open two new loan production offices in and most of these locations will be in the richmond  virginia and winston salem  north carolina metropolitan areas

at acquisition  pcb had total assets of million  total net loans of million and total deposits of million 
these resources were included in the company s financial statements beginning with the second quarter of under the terms of the merger agreement  shares of pcb common stock were purchased for per share in cash 
the total deal value  including the cash out of outstanding stock options  was approximately million 
concurrent with the pcb acquisition  peoples community bank  the wholly owned subsidiary of pcb  was merged into the bank

net interest income the primary source of the company s earnings is net interest income  the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
significant categories of earning assets are loans and securities while deposits and borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
for purposes of the following discussion  comparison of net interest income is done on a tax equivalent basis  which provides a common basis for comparing yields on earning assets exempt from federal income taxes to those which are fully taxable see the table titled average balance sheets and net interest income analysis 
net interest income was million for  compared to million for tax equivalent net interest income totaled million for  an increase of million from the million reported for the increase reflects a million increase due to increased volume  which was partially offset by a million decrease due to rate changes on the underlying assets and liabilities 
during  average earning assets increased million while average interest bearing liabilities increased million over the comparable period 
the yield on average earning assets increased basis points to from for the rate earned on assets was positively impacted by the continued increases in short term market interest rates throughout total cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points during  as such liabilities were also affected by increases in short term market interest rates 
the net result was a decrease of basis points to net interest rate spread  or the difference between interest income on earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
spread was compared to for the same period last year 
the company s tax equivalent net interest margin of for was essentially unchanged with a small decrease of basis points from in the largest contributor to the increase in the yield on average earning assets in  on a volume weighted basis  was the million increase in loans held for investment 
the loan portfolio contributed approximately million to the change in interest income  while the portfolio s average yield increased basis points from the prior year to 
the yield on variable rate loans tied to prime and other indices increased in response to the recent increases in short term interest rates 
during  the tax equivalent yield on securities available for sale increased basis points to while the average balance decreased by million 
although the total portfolio decreased through the period  the average tax equivalent yield increased due to the addition of higher rate securities and the sale of lower rate securities 
funds received from the paydowns  maturities  calls  and sales of investment securities helped fund loan growth 
average interest bearing balances with banks remained steady during  while the yield increased basis points to 
the yield on those balances is directly correlated to the increases in the target federal funds rate which occurred throughout the year 

table of contents the company attempts to control the cost of deposited funds in relation to the prevailing economic climate and competitive forces 
the company achieves its balance sheet management goals through its asset liability management committee 
throughout  the pressures of increasing short term interest rates resulted in an increase of basis points in the average cost of interest bearing deposits 
the average rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits remained consistent  while the average rate paid on savings  which includes money market and passbook accounts  increased basis points 
the company was successful in keeping rates paid on interest bearing checking accounts relatively stable and increased money market account rates to remain competitive 
average time deposits increased million while the average rate paid increased basis points to 
during the first quarter  the company ran a successful certificate of deposit campaign  which generated market rate deposits centered mostly in the richmond and winston salem markets 
the level of average non interest bearing demand deposits increased million to million compared to the prior year 
average federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased million due mostly to increases in the balances of customer repurchase agreements 
the average rate paid on those funds also increased  as they are closely tied to the target federal funds rate 
average federal home loan bank fhlb advances increased million as the company borrowed million through the year 
interest paid on those borrowings increased basis points as interest rates were increasing on adjustable rate borrowings 
other borrowings remained steady  but the rate paid increased points because the majority of such borrowings consist of the company s trust preferred borrowings  which are tied to libor

in this analysis  the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the volume and rate columns in proportion to absolute dollar amounts 
this table will assist you in understanding the changes in the company s principal source of revenue  net interest income

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million when compared to the year ended december  the increase in loan loss provision between the periods is primarily attributable to new or increased specific allocations  increased commercial and residential real estate loan volume  and changes in various qualitative risk factors

the remaining components of other operating income decreased thousand compared to included securities gains of thousand  which were thousand less than those recognized in non interest expense total non interest expense from continuing operations was million  an increase of million for over the single largest item contributing to the increase was the million prepayment penalty incurred in connection with the early termination of million of fhlb advances in late december 
salaries and benefits increased approximately million due to increases in staffing to support added corporate services  continued branch and loan production office growth  and increased health benefits costs 
occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses increased thousand and thousand  respectively  compared to the general level of occupancy and furniture and equipment costs in grew largely as a result of increases in depreciation and insurance costs associated with de novo branches and depreciation associated with continued investment in operating equipment and technology infrastructure 
all other operating expense accounts increased thousand in compared to the most significant item within the increase in other operating expense was the increase in audit fees  which increased over thousand year over year 
the company uses a traditional efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes this traditional ratio better focuses attention on the core operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap based ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing non interest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
the reader is cautioned that the traditional efficiency ratio used by the company may not be comparable to gaap or non gaap efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 

table of contents in general  the efficiency ratio is non interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income 
non interest expenses used in the calculation of the traditional  non gaap efficiency ratio exclude amortization of goodwill and intangibles and non recurring expenses 
income for the traditional ratio is increased for the favorable effect of tax exempt income see table i  and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  and non recurring gains 
the measure is different from the gaap based efficiency ratio  which also is presented in this report 
the gaap based measure is calculated using non interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
the gaap and traditional based efficiency ratios are reconciled in the table below 
the traditional  non gaap efficiency ratios for continuing operations for   and were   and  respectively 
increases in the current year is reflective of the higher direct costs associated with the new offices in and and added corporate overhead required to support company expansion

 using the intrinsic value model 
under opinion no 
 the company recognized no compensation expense related to stock options granted  and provided pro forma disclosures of the effects of accounting for stock options under the fair value model 
the company has selected the modified prospective method of transition 
management expects the adoption of the new equity based compensation accounting standard to result in increased compensation expense 
the total compensation cost related to nonvested stock option awards that management expects to recognize is approximately thousand 
the weighted average period over which that compensation cost is expected to be recognized is years 
future awards of stock options will increase the amount of compensation expense to be recognized under sfas r 

table of contents income tax expense income tax expense is comprised of federal and state current and deferred income taxes on pre tax earnings of the company 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income may vary significantly from statutory rates due to items of income and expense which are excluded  by law  from the calculation of taxable income 
these items are commonly referred to as permanent differences 
the most significant permanent differences for the company include i income on state and municipal securities which are exempt from federal income tax  ii certain dividend payments which are deductible by the company  iii tax credits generated by investments in low income housing and iv for  goodwill impairment expense which is not deductible 
consolidated income taxes for were million  a effective tax rate  compared to million  an effective tax rate of  for the effective tax rate for the was less than due to the tax benefits realized from the divestiture of the mortgage banking subsidiary 
specifically  the non deductible impairment charges recognized in and the first two quarters of reduced the book carrying basis of the investment in the mortgage subsidiary and resulted in a permanent difference during the third quarter of upon sale of the entity 
this difference reduced the effective tax rate to and is the primary cause of the increase in the effective tax rate when comparing to the previously disclosed state tax audit of state income  franchise  and sales tax in one of the company s tax jurisdictions was concluded during the fourth quarter of the outcome of this audit was favorable to the company and resulted in total state income and franchise tax refunds of approximately thousand

this increase was partially offset by a net million reduction due to rate changes on the underlying assets and liabilities as asset yields fell in the declining rate environment 
average earning assets increased million while average interest bearing liabilities increased million 
the yield on average earning assets decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease was accompanied by a basis point decline in the cost of funds during the same periods 
as a result  the net interest rate spread at december  was lower at compared to for the same period last year 
the company s tax equivalent net interest margin of for the year ended december  decreased basis points from in the largest contributor to the decrease in the yield on average earning assets in  on a volume weighted basis  was the decrease in the overall tax equivalent yield on loans held for investment of basis points from the prior year to  as loans repriced downward in response to the declining rate environment of the preceding year and continued low rates in the first half of the average balance of loans increased million  largely due to the pcb acquisition in tennessee and expansion offices in north carolina 
the decline in asset yield is 
table of contents attributable to the recent interest rate environment which created refinancing or repricing incentives for fixed rate borrowers to lower their borrowing costs 
strong competition for commercial loans also held loan yields lower in during  the taxable equivalent yield on securities available for sale decreased basis points to while the average balance increased by million 
consistent with the current rate environment  the company and the securities industry as a whole have experienced rapid turnover in securities as higher yielding securities are either called or prepaid as refinancing opportunities arise

other operating income improved  or thousand  in during  the company realized a gain on sale of securities of approximately million due largely to the sale of million of corporate bonds held in the company s available for sale investment portfolio  the market value of which had declined in step with the flattening of the treasury yield curve 
the proceeds from the sale of these securities in the second quarter of provided sufficient liquidity to pay off overnight borrowings and assisted the company in funding increased loan demand 
these gains  along with smaller gains on securities called  compared to those of the same period of reflect a year over year increase of thousand

this review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the length of time the fair value has been below cost  the expectation for that security s performance  the creditworthiness of the issuer and the company s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery or maturity 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary would be recorded as a loss within non interest income in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   the combined depreciation in value of the individual securities in an unrealized loss position for more than months was less than of the combined reported value of the aggregate securities portfolio 
management does not believe any unrealized loss  individually or in the aggregate  as of december   represents other than temporary impairment 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature 
furthermore  the company believes the decline in value is attributable to changes in market interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuer

these securities generally carry aaa bond ratings  most of which also carry credit enhancement insurance by major insurers of investment obligations 
the portfolio totaled million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease is reflective of continuing paydowns  maturities and calls within the portfolio 
the market value of investment securities held to maturity was and of book value at december  and  respectively 
recent trends in interest rates have had little effect on the portfolio market value since december   due to its larger percentage of municipal securities which display less price sensitivity to rate changes

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance is increased by charges to earnings in the form of provisions and by recoveries of prior charge offs  and decreased by charge offs 
the provisions are calculated to bring the allowance to a level  which  according to a systematic process of measurement  is reflective of the required amount needed to absorb probable losses 
management performs monthly assessments to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
differences between actual loss experience and estimates are reflected through adjustments that are made by either increasing or decreasing the loss provision based upon current measurement criteria 
commercial  consumer and mortgage loan portfolios are evaluated separately for purposes of determining the loan loss portion of the allowance 
the specific components of the loan allowance include allocations to individual commercial credits and allocations to the remaining non homogeneous and homogeneous pools of loans 
management s allocations are based on judgment of qualitative and quantitative factors about both the macro and micro economic conditions reflected within the portfolio of loans and commitments and the economy as a whole 
factors considered in this evaluation include  but are not necessarily limited to  probable losses from loan and other credit arrangements  general economic conditions  changes in credit concentrations or pledged collateral  historical loan loss experience  and trends in portfolio volume  maturity  composition  delinquencies  and non accruals 
while management has attributed the allowance for loan losses to various portfolio segments  the allowance is available for the entire portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in the allowance since december is primarily attributable to changes in various qualitative risk factors specific to the portfolio and increased charge offs for management considers the allowance adequate based upon its analysis of the portfolio as of december  however  no assurance can be made that additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds while maintaining an acceptable level of net interest income given the current interest rate environment 
the company s primary component of operational revenue  net interest income  is subject to variation as a result of changes in interest rate environments in conjunction with unbalanced repricing opportunities on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk has four primary components including repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
repricing risk occurs when earning assets and paying liabilities reprice at differing times as interest rates change 
basis risk occurs when the underlying rates on the assets and liabilities the institution holds change at different levels or in varying degrees 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences as a result of unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
lastly  option risk is due to embedded options  often called put or call options  given or sold to holders of financial instruments 
in order to mitigate the effect of changes in the general level of interest rates  the company manages repricing opportunities and thus  its interest rate sensitivity 
the company seeks to control its interest rate risk irr exposure to insulate net interest income and net earnings from fluctuations in the general level of interest rates 
to measure its exposure to irr  quarterly simulations of net interest income are performed using financial models that 
table of contents project net interest income through a range of possible interest rate environments including rising  declining  most likely and flat rate scenarios 
the results of these simulations indicate the existence and severity of irr in each of those rate environments based upon the current balance sheet position  assumptions as to changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities and management s estimate of yields to be attained in those future rate environments and rates that will be paid on various deposit instruments and borrowings 
specific strategies for management of irr have included shortening the amortized maturity of new fixed rate loans  increasing the volume of adjustable rate loans to reduce the average maturity of the bank s interest earning assets  and monitoring the term structure of liabilities to maintain a balanced mix of maturity and repricing to mitigate the potential exposure 
the simulation model used by the company captures all earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and all off balance sheet financial instruments and combines the various factors affecting rate sensitivity into an earnings outlook 
based upon the latest simulation  the company believes that it is biased slightly toward liability sensitive position 
absent adequate management  liability sensitive positions can negatively impact net interest income in a rising rate environment or  alternatively  positively impact net interest income in a falling rate environment 
the company has established policy limits for tolerance of interest rate risk that allow for no more than a reduction in projected net interest income based on quarterly income simulations compared to forecasted results 
in addition  the policy addresses exposure limits to changes in the economic value of equity according to predefined policy guidelines 
the most recent simulation indicates that current exposure to interest rate risk is within the company s defined policy limits as short term rates are anticipated to remain relatively stable throughout the following table summarizes the impact of immediate and sustained rate shocks in the interest rate environment on net interest income and the economic value of equity as of december  and the model simulates plus and minus basis points from the flat rate simulation at december  this table  which illustrates the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes  is based upon numerous assumptions including relative and estimated levels of key interest rates over a twelve month time period 
this type of modeling technique  although useful  does not take into account all strategies that management might undertake in response to a sudden and sustained rate shock as depicted 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables
