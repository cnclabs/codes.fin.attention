item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing our business  operations and financial condition are discussed in part i  item a in this annual report 
our clients include global and regional leading companies within the countries in which we provide services  and represent several industries  such as technology  telecommunications  energy  financial services  automotive  health care  education  consumer retail and travel 
additionally  we provide services to federal  state and local government clients within the us  and to provincial and other governmental entities in canada and europe 
we derive long term or recurring revenues from several client relationships  which are revenue commitments of one year or more in which our client has committed spending levels to sapient  or chosen us as an exclusive provider of certain services 
in  recurring revenues represented of our nearly three times the industry average is sapient s track record for delivering the right requirements  on time and on budget as compared to an industry benchmark which is created and measured by an independent third party research firm  the standish group 

table of contents global services revenues 
additionally  in our five largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in the aggregate  and one client  sprint formerly nextel  prior to merger of nextel and sprint in august   accounted for more than of such revenues 
we provide our services under both fixed price  fixed time and time and materials contracts 
we price our work based on established rates that vary according to our consultants experience levels  roles and the geographic locations 
our time and materials contracts include arrangements in which we perform services based on an estimated fee range  or in which we cap our total fees 
under capped time and materials engagements in which we agree to complete certain deliverables for the client during the project  we assume the risk that we have estimated the correct level of effort and time frame to complete the deliverables at a cost that does not exceed the cap 
in fixed price  fixed time contracts  similarly  we assume the risk of estimating correctly the scope of work and resources required  and undertaking rigorous project management throughout an engagement  to ensure we deliver the project on time and on budget 
we may recognize losses or lower profitability on fixed price contracts if we do not successfully manage the foregoing risks 
additionally  these risks are magnified with respect to large projects  which we are entering into more frequently and multi staged projects in which we perform our scope and labor estimates  and fix the total project price through implementation  at an early stage of an engagement 
within the past twelve months  we have completed two strategic acquisitions that significantly augment our service capabilities and the value we can provide to our clients

we organize our sales professionals primarily along industry lines  both within our us and international business units 
we believe that the industry and geographic focus of our sales professionals enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and generates additional client engagements 
we continue to actively build relationships and strategic alliances with technology and other consulting companies  including packaged technology vendors 
these relationships focus on a wide range of joint activities  including working on client engagements  evaluating and recommending the other party s technology and other solutions to customers  and training and transferring knowledge regarding the other party s solutions 
we believe that these relationships and strategic alliances enable us to provide better delivery and value to our existing clients and attract new clients through referrals and joint engagements 
competition the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  offshore outsourcing companies  marketing agencies and clients internal information systems departments 
to a lesser extent we compete with boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geography based 
with respect to our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large defense contractors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include ability to solve business problems  ability to provide innovative solutions  expertise and talent with advanced technologies  global scale  expertise in delivering complex projects through teams located in globally distributed geographies  quality and speed of delivery  price of solutions  industry knowledge  technology enabled marketing expertise  understanding of user experience  and sophisticated project and program management capabilities 
we believe that we compete favorably when considering these factors  and that our ability to deliver business innovation and outstanding value to our clients on time and on budget  our gdd model  and our successful track record in doing so  distinguishes us from our competitors 
intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary consulting methodology  custom developed software and other rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
our services involve the development of business  technology and marketing solutions for specific client engagements 
ownership of these solutions is the subject of negotiation and is frequently assigned to the client  although we often retain ownership of certain development tools and may be granted a license to use the solutions for certain purposes 
certain of our clients have prohibited us from marketing for specified periods of 
table of contents time or to specified third parties the solutions we develop for them  and we anticipate that certain of our clients will demand similar or other restrictions in the future

risk factors risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by economic conditions and related fluctuations in customer demand for business  technology and other consulting services 
the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions historically has tended to fluctuate in tandem with economic cycles particularly those in the united states and the united kingdom  where we earn the majority of our revenues 
during economic cycles when many companies are experiencing financial difficulties or uncertainty  clients and potential clients may cancel or delay spending on technology and other business initiatives 
military actions in iraq and elsewhere  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest are among the factors that may adversely impact regional and global economic conditions and  concomitantly  client investments in our services 
although economic conditions in our industry have been improving in recent years  a sudden or gradual downturn in these conditions may cause large companies to cancel or delay their consulting initiatives 
further  if the rate of cancellations or delays significantly increases  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
our market is highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  offshore outsourcing companies  and clients internal information systems departments 
other competitors include interactive and traditional advertising agencies and  to a lesser extent  boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geography based 
with respect to our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large defense contractors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition  than we do 
often  these competitors offer a larger and more diversified suite of products and services than we offer 
these competitors may win client engagements by significantly discounting their services in exchange for a client s promise to purchase other goods and services from the competitor  either concurrently or in the future 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

table of contents our international operations and global distributed delivery model subject us to increased risk 
we currently have offices in the united kingdom  germany  india and canada 
our international operations are a significant percentage of our total revenues  and our gdd model is a key component of our ability to deliver our services successfully 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  complexities and costs in effectively managing multi national operations and associated internal controls and procedures  significant changes in immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  restrictions imposed on the import and export of technologies in countries where we operate  and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our offices in new delhi and bangalore  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india or pakistan or the surrounding countries  or a business interruption resulting from a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could hinder our ability to successfully utilize gdd  and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each project 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may be unable to perform adequately our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements 
our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
the improvement in demand for business  marketing and technology consulting services has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in business  marketing and technology consulting  particularly at senior levels 
we have been expanding our operations in all locations  and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people 
we may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our desired expansion or staffing plans 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we attract 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to manage adequately and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of expensive independent contractors  which may increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
we earn revenues  incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies  and currency fluctuations affect our financial results 
we have significant international operations  and we frequently earn our revenues and incur our costs in various foreign currencies 
our international segment revenues were million for the year ended december  doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas  including revenues  purchases  payroll and investments 
we also have a significant amount of 
table of contents foreign currency net asset exposures 
certain foreign currency exposures  to some extent  are naturally offset within an international business unit  because revenues and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency  and certain cash balances are held in us dollar denominated accounts 
however  due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our financial results 
our gdd model also subjects us to increased currency risk  because we frequently incur a significant portion of our project costs in indian rupees and earn revenue from our clients in other currencies 
currently  we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency risk  but we may adopt such strategies in the future 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the united states could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from those subsidiaries to the parent company  and to other international subsidiaries  when it is cost effective to do so 
however  any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact the availability and size of these funds for repatriation or transfer 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues 
a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly personnel  rent and depreciation  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 
we may lose money if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements 
many of our projects are based on fixed price  fixed time contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources and schedule required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price  fixed time contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are increasingly entering into contracts for large projects that magnify this risk 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that is too low and  therefore  this incorrect estimation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our profitability will be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our pricing and utilization rates as well as control our costs 
our profitability derives from and is impacted by three factors  primarily i the prices for our services  ii our consultants utilization or billable time  and iii our costs 
to achieve our desired level of profitability our utilization must remain at an appropriate rate  and we must contain our costs 
should we reduce our prices in the future as a result of pricing pressures  or should we be unable to achieve our target utilization rates and costs  our profitability could be adversely impacted and the price of our securities could decline materially 
we partner with third parties on certain complex engagements in which our performance depends upon  and may be adversely impacted by  the performance of such third parties 
certain complex projects may require that we partner with specialized software or systems vendors or other partners to perform our services 
often in these circumstances  we are liable to our clients for the performance of these third parties 
should the third parties fail to perform timely or satisfactorily  our clients may elect to terminate the projects or withhold payment until the services have been completed successfully 
additionally  we may lose revenue or realize lower profits if we incur additional costs due to delays or because we must assign additional personnel to complete the project 
furthermore  our relationships with our clients and our reputation generally may suffer harm as a result of our partners unsatisfactory performance 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services 
some of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
a client s termination of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff that were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects  or client termination of one or more recurring revenue contracts see definition of recurring revenue in item  above  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by unauthorized disclosures of confidential information or by our failure to remedy system failures 
we frequently receive confidential information from our clients  including confidential customer data  that we use to develop solutions 
if any person  including a company employee  misappropriates client confidential information  or if client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems  system failures or otherwise  we may have substantial liabilities to our clients or client customers 
further  many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
while we have taken precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for breaches of confidentiality and defects in the applications or systems we provide  and carry insurance coverage which mitigates these liabilities in certain instances  we cannot be assured that these limitations and insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
even if these limitations and insurance coverages are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  such claims may harm our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

table of contents our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and create liability for us as well as harm our reputation and client relationships 
the services that we offer to clients may infringe the intellectual property ip rights of third parties and result in legal claims against our clients and sapient 
these claims may damage our reputation  adversely impact our client relationships and create liability for us 
moreover  although we generally agree in our client contracts to indemnify the clients for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third party ip infringement claims associated with our services  the resolution of these claims  irrespective of whether a court determines that our services infringed another party s ip rights  may be time consuming  disruptive to our business and extraordinarily costly 
finally  in connection with an ip infringement dispute  we may be required to cease using or developing certain ip that we offer to our clients 
these circumstances could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue as well as require us to incur significant expense to develop alternative or modified services for our clients 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we put a portion of our fees at risk based on project results and may not earn these fees if we do not succeed 
our business model focuses heavily on delivering measurable business results for our clients  and increasingly we are aligning our interests with our client s interests by putting a portion of our fees at risk  dependent on our client s attainment of the business value we promised 
in  we recognized approximately thousand of revenue by achieving previously agreed upon measurable business results 
our inability to deliver the business value that we have promised on a project could materially affect the profitability of that project  because we typically will incur the same level of project costs regardless of whether the promised business value is attained 
we could also experience delays in revenue recognition or payment because the measurement of business value is often complex and may involve a verification process between us and our client 
as a result  our failure to deliver the business value that we promise to our clients could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 

table of contents in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
our co chairmen and co ceos have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote 
jerry a 
greenberg and j 
stuart moore  our co chairmen of the board of directors and co chief executive officers  own approximately of our outstanding common stock in the aggregate 
as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence  and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees  including messrs 
greenberg and moore 
our employment arrangements with messrs 
greenberg and moore and with our other key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although  to the extent permitted by law  we require our employees to sign agreements prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
furthermore  for those employees whom we involuntarily terminated in connection with our restructuring actions  we have waived the non competition clause of their agreements in exchange for releases of claims 
we granted these waivers only in connection with the restructuring actions  and our general practice is not to waive the non competition obligations of departing employees 
we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions and joint ventures 
the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions or joint ventures that we may undertake might not be achieved 
for example  if we acquire a company  we cannot be certain that clients of the acquired business will continue to conduct business with us  or that employees of the acquired business will continue their employment or integrate successfully into our operations and culture 
the identification  consummation and integration of acquisitions and joint ventures require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we may incur significant expenses in completing any such acquisitions  and we may assume significant liabilities  some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisition 
if we do not effectively improve our operational and financial processes and systems  our ability to achieve efficiencies and cost savings may be delayed and our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
in  we implemented upgrades to our financial and human resource software systems to improve our organizational processes and efficiency  and accommodate our anticipated growth in and beyond 
additionally  to streamline our g a infrastructure and costs as a percentage of revenue  and ensure that the company can appropriately scale as our business expands  we are redesigning many operational processes and transitioning certain internal  non billable roles to our india office 
the activities principally relate to finance  human resources and certain it functions  and will result in the elimination of certain g a jobs in the united states  united kingdom  germany and canada 
if we do not timely  efficiently and effectively upgrade or 
table of contents replace systems  redesign processes and implement the preceding role transitions as our business requires  we may be unable to support our growth effectively or realize cost savings as quickly as expected and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting 
additionally  the quality of our services may decline pending the successful completion of these initiatives 
consequently  our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
a failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on the company 
we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and in our quarterly reports on form q for the first  second and third fiscal quarters of  management reported that a material weakness existed in the company s internal control over financial reporting related to the company s lack of a sufficient complement of senior financial accounting and reporting personnel possessing competencies commensurate with the company s financial reporting requirements 
as described more fully in item a of this annual report  this material weakness has been remediated as of december  we may from time to time in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
further  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
should we fail either to maintain adequate internal controls or implement required new or improved controls  our business and results of operations could be harmed  we may be unable to report properly or timely the results of our operations  and investors could lose faith in the reliability of our financial statements 
consequently  the price of our securities may be adversely and materially impacted 
our corporate governance provisions may deter a financially attractive takeover attempt 
provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including a transaction in which stockholders would receive a premium for their shares 
these provisions include the following our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock  any action that may be taken by stockholders must be taken at an annual or special meeting and may not be taken by written consent  stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements before raising a matter at a meeting of stockholders or nominating a director for election  and a chairman of the board or a chief executive officer are the only persons who may call a special meeting of stockholders 
provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us

we will continue to focus on increasing recurring revenue in our recurring revenues were of our services revenues in compared to in recurring revenues are revenue commitments of a year or more in which the client has committed spending levels to sapient or chosen sapient as an exclusive provider of certain services 
during  certain of these recurring revenue agreements will end  while others may be signed 
during we increased the number of our project personnel to effectively staff our client engagements and achieve the desired staffing mix of experience level and role 
currently  we are retaining subcontractors in certain cases to fill specific project needs 
if we are not successful in maintaining effective staffing levels  our ability to achieve our service revenue and profitability objectives will be adversely affected 
our ability to effectively staff our engagements and achieve the desired staffing mix depends heavily on our ability to keep turnover at appropriate levels 
our voluntary turnover for decreased to compared to for

our gdd methodology continues to be important to our clients success 
this proprietary methodology allows us to provide high quality  cost effective solutions under accelerated project schedules 
by engaging india s highly skilled technology specialists  we can provide services at lower total costs as well as offer a continuous delivery capability resulting from time differences between india and the countries we serve 
we also employ our gdd methodology to provide application management services 
our full year net income was million in compared to million in our operating margin for was compared to in the year over year decline in our operating margin is primarily due to a decrease in the utilization rate  primarily related to our non us business units  and additional restructuring and other related charges primarily related to previously restructured property

in conjunction with streamlining g a processes  we will be transferring a number of support activities to india 
these activities principally relate to approximately people in finance  human resources  and some of our internal it functions 
this will result in the elimination of certain g a jobs in the united states  united kingdom  germany and canada  and  as such  we have taken a  restructuring provision during the fourth quarter of the total costs are expected to be approximately million and are expected to be paid during on june   we purchased business information solutions  llc bis  a privately held provider of sap related professional services  specializing in business intelligence solutions 
we added forty eight full time bis people 
we believe this acquisition will allow us to expand our services in business intelligence and in newer modules of sap  specifically business information warehouse  strategic enterprise management  data analytics  netweaver  other sap new dimension products and energy specific solutions 
in addition  we believe the acquisition will allow us to offer a much broader variety of value added erp integration  upgrade  and maintenance services related to the globally dominant sap products and its netweaver platform

through this acquisition we have enhanced our strengths in advertising  digital and direct marketing  brand development  data mining  customer acquisition and loyalty  paid search  and media planning and buying strategies and services 
additionally  we now can provide our clients a clear understanding of the effectiveness of their media spend using bridgetrack  a proprietary online marketing and analysis platform 
we believe that our combination with pgi expands our opportunities to help our clients exploit the possibilities created by the rapid evolution of media  advertising  and technology and derive measurable value from their marketing investments 
although the growth in our business has been positive  the economic outlook  as always  is subject to change 
any decline in our service revenues will have a significant impact on our financial results  particularly because a significant portion of our operating costs such as personnel  rent and depreciation are fixed in advance of a particular quarter 
in addition  our future operating segment and overall company revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
a summary of those accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services under written service contracts with our clients when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where the customer  at its discretion  has the right to reject the services prior to final acceptance  revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs 
we recognize revenues from our fixed price  fixed time technology implementation consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method pursuant to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues generated from fixed price  fixed time non technology implementation contracts  except for support and maintenance contracts  are recognized based upon a proportional performance model in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
our percentage of completion method and our proportional performance method of accounting calculate revenue based on the percentage of labor incurred to estimated total labor 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized as services are provided 
revenue generated from support and maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contract term 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor incurred and estimated total labor  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue for a contract 
certain contracts provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards 
revenue related to the achievement of performance standards accounted for approximately thousand  million and thousand of revenue recognized in  and  respectively 
revenues from arrangements with multiple elements are allocated based on the fair value of the elements in accordance with eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for these arrangements  we evaluate all deliverables in the arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
fair value is determined based on reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable 
revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand alone basis  fair value of the separate elements exists and  in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element  performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control 
this evaluation is performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
the evaluation involves significant judgments regarding the nature of the services and deliverables being provided  whether these services and deliverables can reasonably be divided into the separate units of accounting and the fair value of the separate elements 

table of contents if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for a contract or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are identified 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that is too low and  therefore  a correct estimation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize revenue for services when collection from the client is reasonably assured  and our fees are fixed or determinable 
we establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are thirty days from invoice date 
revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all available evidence  such as recent and expected future operating results by tax jurisdiction  current and enacted tax legislation and other temporary differences between book and tax accounting  to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of operating losses incurred in  and  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  relating to the deferred tax assets in the united states 
having assessed the ability to realize the deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions  we believe that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the deferred tax assets in canada  the united kingdom  and germany 
the establishment and amount of the valuation allowance requires significant estimates and judgment and can materially affect our results of operations 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss in each jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment on a regular basis for the existence of facts and circumstances that may suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of 
table of contents the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount  the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
valuation of goodwill 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
the standard also includes provisions for the assessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangible assets and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  identification of other impaired assets within an reporting unit  disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair value of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
the company s reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of our consolidated financial statements 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill  were allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification and percentage of revenue 
to conduct a goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets and operating plans 
we performed the annual assessment during the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
we complete goodwill impairment analysis at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill might be impaired 
determining fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgements could yield different results 
costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use 
we account for costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
as required by sop  the company capitalizes the costs incurred during the application development stage  which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces  coding  installation and testing 
costs incurred for internal use computer software during the preliminary project stage and through post implementation stages of internal use computer software are expensed as incurred 
the capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of development cost requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  technological and economic feasibility  and estimated economic life 
capitalized software is included in property and equipment and is depreciated over its estimated life  which is typically three years 

table of contents restructuring and other related charges 
we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these exit plans required that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates  which included contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space vacated and related costs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions and lease buy out assumptions 
these estimates include lease buy out costs  anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant  other terms and conditions in sub lease contracts  and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our lease buy out assumptions  sub lease assumptions and space requirements may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if any future adjustments are required to the restructuring initiatives recorded under the provisions of eitf  such adjustments will be measured in accordance with eitf sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
sfas includes a rebuttable presumption that if an entity has a past practice of providing similar termination benefits to employees  the benefit arrangement is presumed to be an ongoing benefit arrangement that should be accounted for under sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
sfas prescribes the accounting for the estimated cost of benefits  including severance benefits  provided by an employer to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement 
a liability is recognized when the severance amounts relate to prior services rendered  the payment of the amount is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
since the second quarter of  we have accounted for severance related restructuring charges in accordance with sfas because we have a history of paying similar severance benefits since as of december   we have recorded  to restructuring and other related charges in our consolidated statement of operations  related to severance and termination benefits in accordance with sfas these charges relate to our initiative to reengineer general and administrative activities in an effort to streamline such functions 
as of december   no amounts related to this liability have been paid 
additional costs of the restructuring related to the initiative announced during are expected to be approximately million associated with costs incurred in accordance with sfas  which are primarily stay bonuses  that will be amortized over the period in which they are earned 
these are expected to be paid during the second and third quarters of our remaining cash lease commitments related to restructured facilities are approximately million at december   of which approximately is accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  and the remaining relates to sublease income assumptions 
we have entered into signed sublease arrangements for approximately million  with the remaining million for future estimated sublease arrangements 
if the estimated sublease dates were to be delayed by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional million in our statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges 
our sublease reserve is sensitive to the level of sublease rent anticipated and the timing of sublease commencement 
a reduction in our sublease rate would have resulted in an additional million of charges as of the end of contingent liabilities 
we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although 
table of contents the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts we have previously accrued 
accounting for acquisitions 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates 
additionally  under sfas  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test based on a discounted future cash flows approach 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  or the fair value of a reporting unit declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements  other than the ownership interest that we held in our joint venture in milan  italy until july   at which time our interest in the joint venture was acquired by the management team of the joint venture 
see equity investments in this part ii  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a more detailed discussion of this joint venture

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments 
at december   our exposure to market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our marketable investments consist primarily of fixed income securities 
we invest only with high credit quality issuers and we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a significant increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the net consideration in connection with our bis acquisition in june included the issuance of  shares of common stock  of which  of theses shares carry an embedded put and call option feature 
the put feature could require us to purchase up to  of the issued shares for an aggregate price of approximately thousand as of december  as the potential redemption is outside of our control  the potential future cash obligation associated with the put option has been classified outside of permanent equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the put option expires on june  as of december    shares are subject to the put option feature 
exchange rate sensitivity we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  as a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the british pound  the euro  the indian rupee and the canadian dollar 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
currently  we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency risk  but we may adopt such strategies in the future 
for a discussion of the risks we face as a result of foreign currency fluctuations  please see risk factors in part i  item a management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
