item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to  we focused most of our efforts on the sale and development of panellink dvi transmitters  receivers and controllers for the pc and display market 
in  in order to decrease our dependence on the pc business  we began focusing our resources on entering two new markets  ce and storage  which we believed would grow significantly and in which we could apply our technology and expertise in high speed serial interfaces 
during  we acquired dvdo  a provider of digital video processing systems for the ce market and zillion  a developer of high speed transmission technology for data storage applications 
in  we focused on accelerating our entry into the ce and storage markets  leveraging our ip into licensing revenue  and restructuring the company to improve profitability 
during  we acquired cmd  a provider of storage subsystems and semiconductors designed for storage area networks  and scl  a provider of mixed signal and high speed circuit designs 
from through  we focused on our diversification strategy and the continued expansion of our presence in the ce and storage markets  including the introduction of our first hdmi products for the ce market in  as well as continuing to leverage our intellectual property to generate revenue 
we also focused on improving our profitability and reducing our cash usage throughout this period 
from through  we achieved solid revenue growth  resulting in revenue of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
we were also able to successfully leverage our intellectual property to generate million  million  and million of development  licensing and royalty revenue for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
during we continued this strong performance  achieving million of revenue representing a increase compared to  million of net income compared to a net loss of  for  an increase in cash and short term investments of million compared to an increase of million in  and million of development  licensing and royalty revenue compared to million of this type of revenue in 
products sold into the pc market have been declining as a percentage of our total revenues and generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenues in if we include licensing revenues  these percentages would be   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in the pc market  during  our business was favorably impacted by the continued market share growth of intel s pci express integrated graphic chipsets igcs 
all desktop and notebook pc platforms based on intel igcs require the use of a discrete sdvo transmitter for supporting dvi or hdmi functionality  and we continue to maintain strong market share in the discrete dvi transmitter market 
our transmitter business was also positively impacted by increasing oem demand for the dvi dual link feature in desktop and notebook pcs  a market where we are the only provider of discrete dvi dual link transmitters 
finally  our business in the pc market was favorably impacted by demand for our integrated panel controllers that are incorporated into lcd panels used in digital lcd monitors 
this demand led to sales growth in pc integrated circuits from to the pc market saw dvi adoption expand significantly 
in addition  we generated licensing revenue in by licensing certain technology to companies for use in making products for the dual mode interface market 
when intel moved from pci to pci express on the grantsdale platform  it changed the interface for dvi transmitters and moved from the digital video output dvo interface to the new serial digital video output sdvo interface 
our dvi transmitter was designed to work with intel s sdvo port in the intel grantsdale platform  and sales of this transmitter will continue to be driven by the success of the grantsdale platform where dvi is offered 
we expect dvi adoption rates to continue to expand over the next two years as the market moves away from analog and dual mode combination of analog and digital solutions to all digital  higher quality and lower cost solutions 
correspondingly  we expect the prices of digital displays to continue to decrease and drive increased demand for digital only displays that incorporate dvi transmitters and panel controllers such as those sold by us 
we continued to grow our next generation of integrated controller panel ipc product line in with the introduction of two customer specific ipcs 
generally  our transmitter products continued to experience competitive pressure in  primarily from integration by the graphics chip suppliers such as ati technologies and nvidia 
explore technologies  chrontel thine electronics and texas instruments also remain competitors 
because of this increased competition there were 
table of contents lower average selling prices for these products during we expect graphics card manufacturers to continue to integrate a transmitter into their graphics chip  thus eliminating the need for a discrete transmitter device in many host products 
solutions that utilize the integrated graphics supplied by the intel chipset and that wish to connect to the lcd monitor via dvi will be the primary focus of our transmitter business 
in addition  we generated licensing revenue by licensing certain technology to companies for use in making products for the dual mode monitor interface market 
products sold into the ce market have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenues and generated  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if we include licensing revenues  these numbers would be   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
demand for our products will be driven primarily by the adoption rate of the hdmi standard within these product categories 
products sold into the storage market  as a percentage of our total revenues  generated   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
if we include storage related licensing revenues  these numbers were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
demand for our storage semiconductor products is dependent upon the rate at which interface technology transitions from parallel to serial  market acceptance of our steelvine architecture  and the extent to which sata and fibre channel functionality are integrated into chipsets and controllers offered by other companies  which would make our discrete devices unnecessary 
in  we anticipate our legacy storage semiconductor business  fibre channel  and parallel ata revenues to continue decreasing as our steelvine revenues are projected to increase 
in the storage market  we had a number of new and advanced product offerings during we were able to achieve numerous design wins with our satalink products 
in particular  there was widespread market acceptance of the pci e to two port sata solutions for the pc market and a number of major manufacturers incorporated our products into their motherboards 
we expect to leverage our storage expertise in the new and rapidly growing area for ce storage devices through our steelvine architecture 
we anticipate that many next generation consumer devices such as set top boxes  personal video recorders pvrs and media pcs are likely to have one or more external sata ports 
demand declined throughout for our parallel ata products as the market continued to transition from these technologies to serial ata 
we expect demand for these legacy products to continue to decrease significantly throughout and beyond 
our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and it helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology 
most of our licenses include a field of use restriction that prevents the licensee from building a chip in direct competition with those market segments we have chosen to pursue 
revenue from development for licensees  licensing and royalties accounted for  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
licensing contracts are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items  and customer acceptances 
although we attempt to make these factors predictable  many of these factors require significant judgments 
in  we launched panellink cinema partners tm  llc a wholly owned subsidiary of silicon image  inc  which was formally changed to simplay labs  llc simplay in december simplay operates and markets the simplay hd tm testing program  a consumer electronics testing program designed for leading consumer electronics ce manufacturers and technology providers 
current members of the program include hitachi  lg  mitsubishi  samsung  sony  tte and others 
the simplay hd testing program is open to all manufacturers of consumer electronics devices implementing hdmi hdcp including hdtv s  dtv s  set top boxes stb s  dvd players  a v receivers and cables 
the program also maintains broad industry support from a variety of leading digital content providers including the walt disney company  fox  universal and warner bros 
the simplay hd tm testing program is designed to help consumers know that the digital entertainment devices that they purchase have been tested according to specifications aimed at maximizing the delivery hd content 
the program consists of testing  branding and awareness initiatives directed at retailers as well as consumers 
at its core  the program is based on the simplay hd compatibility test specification cts for device manufacturers 
testing encompasses hdcp functionality in conjunction with hdmi  as well as compatibility plug testing between 
table of contents devices from different manufacturers 
products that pass have been verified to meet the simplay hd testing program requirements and are licensed to use the simplay hd logo  enabling consumers to purchase digital entertainment devices with the confidence that they will be able to receive and play the latest digital content with state of the art technology 
leveraging this branding component  the simplay hd testing program will be providing education to retailers on the importance of simplay hd verification 
during  we also focused on improving our profitability and cash flows 
our cash and short term investments increased by million in  versus an increase of million in our net income for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
the increase in from and levels can be attributed to the geographical concentration of our revenue as these customers are primarily in asia 
additionally  the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oem s rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of our revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and in world peace inc  comprised  and of our revenue in  and respectively 
microtek comprised  and of our revenue in  and respectively 
our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors  and to the extent licensing revenue increases  we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are part of flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition for products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return  we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment 
the amount of sales returns and allowances has not been  and is not expected to be  material 
the majority of our products are sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns 
we recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer based on point of sales reports received from our distributors 
due to the timing of receipt of these reports  we recognize distributor sell through using information that lags quarter end by one month 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed 
table of contents or determinable at that time 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed 
our revenue is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer shipments as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventories and activities 
if distributors incorrectly report their inventories or activities  or if our judgment is in error  it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
we have controls in place to minimize the likelihood of this occurrence  but there is no absolute assurance that this will not occur 
license revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items 
however  we may defer recognition of revenue until either cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery or  in the event that the arrangement includes undelivered elements for which the fair value cannot be determined  until the earlier of such time that the fair value can be determined or the elements are delivered 
the fair value of undelivered elements is generally based upon the price charged when the elements are sold separately 
a number of our license agreements require customer acceptance of deliverables  in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables and either payment has been received or is expected within days of acceptance 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available  and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received 
development revenue is recognized when a project is completed and accepted by the other party to the development agreement  and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain instances  we recognize development revenue using the lesser of non refundable cash received or the results of using a proportional performance measure  based on the achievement of project milestones 
our license revenue recognition depends upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectibility of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer  and the reason for the delinquency 
write offs to date have not been material 
at december   we had million of gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of  while we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance  we may record unanticipated write offs in the future 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  determined on a first in first out fifo basis  or market 
actual cost approximates standard cost and standard cost variances 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory  and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will 
table of contents be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
while we endeavor to accurately predict demand and stock commensurate inventory levels  we may record unanticipated material inventory write downs in the future  which may negatively impact our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets we adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant management judgement to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
in estimating the fair value of the business  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our business  there is significant judgment in determining such future cash flows 
we also consider market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date we perform the analysis 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
to date  as a result of our uncertainty regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance 
a significant element of our deferred tax assets are the benefits received from employee stock transactions for excess tax deductions 
if these stock transactions are realized  such benefits will be recorded as a reduction of income taxes payable  with a corresponding increase in stockholders equity 
accrued liabilities certain of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates 
for instance  we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheet each period for the estimated cost of goods and services rendered to us  for which we have not received an invoice 
additionally  a component of our restructuring accrual related to a loss we expect to incur for excess leased facility space is based on numerous assumptions and estimates  such as the market value of the space and the time it will take to sublease the space 
our estimates are based on historical experience  input from sources outside the company  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates 
certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
stock based compensation expense we are required to determine the fair value of stock option grants to non employees  and to record the amount as an expense over the period during which services are provided to us 
management calculates the fair value of these stock option grants using the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate the life of the stock option  
table of contents the volatility of our stock  an appropriate risk free interest rate  and our dividend yield 
we also fair value certain repriced options 
the calculation of fair value is highly sensitive to the expected life of the stock option and the volatility of our stock  both of which we estimate based primarily on historical experience 
legal matters we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred  the effect is recorded promptly in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  sfas no 
which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance

r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb no 
to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
sfas no

under this method  sfas no 
r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that is outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards and the assumed award forfeiture rates 
we have not determined the full impact of sfas no 
r  however we do anticipate that its adoption could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in in may  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and we are required to adopt it starting with the quarter ending march  although we continually evaluate accounting policies  we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

these items were partially offset by an increase in the number of r d projects as well higher salaries and wages resulting from an increased number of engineers on staff 
additional costs are also attributable to the increasing level of complexity in our new products

on april   this program was extended to executives at the december  price which was greater than the fair market value of our stock on april  
under this program  new options vest over a four year period and expire in six years 
compensation expense associated with the option exchange program will be recorded until the options are exercised or expire 
the compensation expense or benefit for the increase or decrease  respectively  in the fair market value of our common stock in excess of the option s exercise price is recognized immediately for vested options and is recognized over the vesting period using an accelerated method for unvested employee options 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
during  we recorded million of amortization of intangible assets  compared to million and million of expense for the amortization of intangible assets for and  respectively 
the amortization expense recorded related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of transwarp networks 
the decrease in was due to the portion of intangible assets related to assembled workforce  which was amortized over eighteen months  being fully amortized at the end of in process research and development 
in process research and development represents technology that has not reached technological feasibility and that has no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
transwarp networks  inc twn 
during the quarter ended june   we completed the acquisition of the assets of twn and recorded a one time expense of million for in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  there was one identified development project that met the necessary criteria polaris 
the value of this project was determined by estimating the future cash flows from the time it was expected to be commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows to present value  and applying a percentage of completion to the calculated values 
the net cash flows from the identified project were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses and applicable income taxes 
the technology related to the polaris project was incorporated into our steelvine product line  which began generating revenue in and is expected to continue 
we based our revenue projections on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
the discount rate used for this project was  which we believe was appropriate based on the risk associated with technology that was not yet commercially feasible 
the percentage of completion for this project was based on research and development expenses incurred immediately prior to the acquisition as a percentage of the total estimated research and development expenses required to bring this project to technological feasibility 
as of the date of the acquisition  we estimated that polaris was complete  with total projected costs of approximately million 
shipments of this product commenced during impairment of intangible assets 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  in accordance with sfas no 
 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal the impairment analysis was based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows as well as our market capitalization at that time 
restructuring 
in march  we reorganized parts of the marketing and product engineering activities of the company into lines of business for personal computer pc  consumer electronics ce and storage products to enable us to better manage our long term growth potential 
in connection with this reorganization  we reduced our workforce by people  or approximately 
these reductions were primarily in engineering and operations functions 
because of this workforce reduction  we recorded restructuring expense of million in the first quarter of  consisting of cash severance related costs of  and non cash severance related costs of  representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options 
severance related costs were determined based on the amount of pay people received that was not for services performed and by measuring the intrinsic value of stock options that were modified to the benefit of terminated

accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased to million and million  respectively  at december  from million and million  respectively  at december  the increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of when certain accounts payables became due  and the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to various activities at the end of deferred margin on sales to distributors increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is principally due to the effect of increased distributor related shipments at december  as compared to december  
table of contents we expect our sales through distributors to increase as a percentage of our total product sales 
accordingly  we expect our inventory and deferred margin on sales to distributors to increase as well 
investing and financing activities we used million of cash in our investing activities in we used million for the purchase of property and equipment and a net million to purchase short term investments  which were partially offset by the proceeds use from the sale of our investment in leadis technology  inc we expect capital spending to increase in as we invest in additional testing resources 
we generated million from financing activities in this included million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock from stock option exercises and espp purchases  offset by  for the repayment of debt 
debt and lease obligations in october  we entered into a million term loan to refinance million of debt acquired in connection with our acquisition of cmd and  of other bank debt 
this loan bore interest at prime plus and required monthly payments through its maturity of october  this loan was repaid in full during fiscal during the three months ended march   we borrowed  to finance certain capital equipment during fiscal this term loan bears interest at and requires monthly payments through its maturity in february as of december    was outstanding under these term loans 
in november  we leased certain capital equipment under a lease arrangement accounted for as a capital lease 
the principal balance outstanding under this lease arrangement as of december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
in december  we entered into a non cancelable operating lease renewal for our principal operating facility  including an additional  square feet of space in an adjacent building  that commenced in august and expires in july in june  the lease terms were amended and we leased approximately  square feet of additional space for a total leased area of approximately  square feet 
the revised agreement provides for a rent free period for the additional space and thereafter initial base monthly rental payments of  and provides for annual increases of thereafter 
as a result of the lease modification we recorded an adjustment of  to the restructuring accrual with an offsetting reduction of our operating expense for the year ended december  in june  in connection with our acquisition of cmd  we acquired the lease of an operating facility in irvine  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  through november we subleased parts of this facility to three separate third parties 
these sublease agreements were co terminous leases and expired in november these subleases collectively generated monthly sublease income of approximately  to offset our payments 
effective december  the original lease was terminated and we entered into a new non cancelable operating lease agreement 
under the terms of the new agreement  base monthly rental lease payments of  are required and increases annually thereafter 
additionally  in connection with our acquisition of scl in july  we acquired the lease of a facility in milpitas  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  per month which expires in january we do not occupy the milpitas facility and therefore are accounting for the remaining monthly payments in the restructuring reserve as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also lease office space in china  taiwan  korea  united kingdom and japan 
rent expense totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under operating leases have not been reduced by expected sublease rental income or by the amount of our restructuring accrual that relates to leased facilities 

table of contents future minimum payments for our operating leases  capital lease obligations  inventory and other purchase commitments and minimum royalty obligations to a related party at december  are as follows in thousands payments due in less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations inventory and other purchase commitments minimum royalty obligations to a related party total as of december   the future minimum rental payments on our capital leases was  which includes approximately  of interest and sales tax 
the entire amount of capital lease obligations have been presented as current liabilities on the face of the consolidated balance sheet 
based on our estimated cash flows for  we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we generate product revenue and related margins  the timing and extent of development  licensing and royalty revenues  investments in inventory and accounts receivable  the cost of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our operating expenses  including legal and patent assertion costs  and general economic conditions 
in addition  cash may be required for future acquisitions should we choose to pursue any 
to the extent existing resources and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
these funds may not be available  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fixed income investments as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 
the following represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis in thousands 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
market price components of our stock compensation expense are tied to our stock price 
changes in our stock price can have a significant affect on the amount recorded as stock compensation expense 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our expenses are incurred in us dollars  thus limiting our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the direct effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates should not have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  however  a long term increase in foreign currency rates would likely result in increased wafer  packaging  assembly or testing costs 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results
