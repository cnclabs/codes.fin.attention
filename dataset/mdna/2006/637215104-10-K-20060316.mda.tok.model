net earnings decreased  from  to  liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was  during compared to  during the comparable period in the prior year 
the principal factors behind the increase can be found in the changes in the components of working capital and the pension charge element within the statement of cash flows 
cash used in investing activities was  during compared to  during the decrease in cash used is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  more marketable securities matured and were placed in cash equivalents during than in  and second  payments for fixed asset additions were higher during than in  reflecting the timing of payments for the equipment for the absorbent product expansion and the modification of the jackson  mississippi plant to a warehousing and shipping facility 
cash used in financing activities for and increased primarily as a result of the 
per share increase of the extra dividend paid during those years 
as a result of the foregoing factors  cash and cash equivalents decreased by  to  working capital decreased by  to  at december   reflecting an increase in the current income tax liability stemming from the increase in current year earnings 
the company s current ratio was to at fiscal year end  compared to to at the end of fiscal the company expects to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that align with its business segments and will make further acquisitions  as well as continue to make capital investments in these segments if the appropriate return on investment is projected 
the company has substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term maturity marketable securities to meet all of its anticipated capital requirements  to make dividend payments  and to fund future growth through acquisitions and other means 
the company intends to continue its investment strategy of safety and short term liquidity throughout its investment holdings 
the interest rate increases over the past several quarters  partially offset by the reduction in the company s investment holdings  currently has resulted in increased levels of interest income for the company 
there can be no assurance that interest rates will not decline 
the interest rate environment is a function of national and international monetary policies as well as the growth and inflation rates of the us and foreign economies  and is not controllable by the company 
defense segment backlog the company s defense segment contract backlog was approximately  at december   and  at december  backlog is defined as the value of funded orders from the customer less the amount of sales recognized against the funded order 
it is anticipated that the backlog will be performed during a to month period

the company can cancel or change many of these purchase orders  but may incur costs if its supplier cannot use the material to manufacture the company s products in other applications or return the material to their supplier 
as a result  the actual amount the company is obligated to pay cannot be estimated 
the company has agreed to make certain earn out payments dependent upon the future earnings performance of companies acquired 
the expected payments noted above were based upon the anticipated future levels of earnings of the acquired companies 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventories new housewares small appliance product introductions are an important part of the company s sales to offset the morbidity rate of other housewares small appliance products and or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions 
new products entail unusual risks and have occasionally in the past resulted in losses related to obsolete inventory as a result of low or diminishing demand for a product 
the company did not have any major new product introduction or morbidity issues in the current year and  accordingly  did not record a reserve for obsolete product 
in the future should product demand issues arise  the company may incur losses related to the obsolescence of the related inventory 
insurance the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business and is self insured for health care costs 
the company insures for product liability claims  and retains a self insured retention insurance accrual in the company s financial statements 
the company utilizes historical trends and other analysis to assist in determining the appropriate accrual 
an increase in the number or magnitude of claims could have a material impact on the company s financial condition 
environmental in may  the company s eau claire  wisconsin site was placed on the united states environmental protection agency s national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of because of hazardous waste deposited on the property 
by december   all remediation projects had been installed  were fully operational  and restoration activities had been completed and accrued liabilities established for the expected cost of the activity 
the company believes its accrued liability reserve will be adequate to satisfy ongoing remediation operations and monitoring activities  however  should environmental agencies require additional studies or remediation projects  it is possible the existing accrual could be inadequate 
the company s current environmental liability is based upon estimates of the future costs to maintain and operate remediation projects and monitor their results based upon historical costs incurred for such activities 
page of new accounting pronouncements please refer to note a for information related to the future effect of adopting new accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sec litigation please refer to footnote i in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on this item 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s interest income on cash equivalents and marketable securities is affected by changes in interest rates in the united states 
cash equivalents include money market funds and day variable rate demand notes which are highly liquid instruments with interest rates set every days that can be tendered to the remarketer upon days notice for payment of principal and accrued interest amounts 
the day tender feature of these variable rate demand notes are further supported by an irrevocable letter of credit from highly rated us banks 
to the extent a bond is not remarketed at par plus accrued interest  the difference is drawn from the bank s letter of credit 
the company s investments are held primarily in fixed and variable rate municipal bonds with an average life of less than one year 
accordingly  changes in interest rates have not had a material effect on the company  and the company does not anticipate that future exposure to interest rate market risk will be material 
the company uses sensitivity analysis to determine its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company has no history of  and does not anticipate in the future  investing in derivative financial instruments 
most transactions with international customers are entered into in us dollars  precluding the need for foreign currency cash flow hedges 
the company s manufacturing contracts with its foreign suppliers contain provisions to share the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the hong kong dollar above and below a fixed range contained in the contracts 
all transactions with the foreign suppliers were within the exchange rate range specified in the contracts during  and there is no similar provision applicable to the chinese yuan which until had been tied to the us dollar 
to the extent there are further revaluations of the yuan vis a vis the us dollar  the cost of products secured via purchase orders issued subsequent to the revaluation may be affected
