item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on management s current expectations 
actual results may differ materially due to a number of factors  including those discussed on page of this report in the section entitled disclosure regarding forward looking statements  item a 
risk factors  and in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview of the year s activities we have grown our brand portfolio by acquiring well recognized brands from larger consumer products companies  as well as other brands from smaller private companies 
the brands we have purchased from larger consumer products companies have long histories of support and brand development 
we believe that at the time we acquired them they were considered non core by their previous owners and did not benefit from focused management or strong marketing support 
when we acquire brands from smaller private companies  we usually do so because we believe they have been constrained by the limited resources of their prior owners 
after acquiring a brand  we seek to increase its sales  market share and distribution in both existing and new channels 
we pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotion  new marketing strategies  improved packaging and formulations and innovative new products 
in fiscal  we continued to focus attention on growth opportunities on the international side of our business 
we have reconfigured sales and distribution arrangements in certain key european and latin american markets 
over the past year we have also set up distribution arrangements in a number of countries where we previously have not done significant business 
we believe this has staged us to continue to extend the reach of our existing product portfolio abroad 
recently  in certain european and asian markets  we secured the rights to introduce a line of hair care appliances under the toni guy brand name 
toni guy is an international chain of hundreds of hair salons throughout europe that has expanded operations into certain key urban markets in the united states 
we believe our association with toni guy will create a new sales opportunities for our products in europe 
domestically  our core business continues to present challenges as we operate in mature markets where we already own significant market share 
our company and industry are also facing challenges sharply rising energy costs  reduced sales and increased costs due to the economic impact from hurricanes  and domestic and international marketplace pressures 
continued consolidation and growth in the largest of retailers has created a very competitive environment that requires careful target pricing  superb customer service  operational excellence in order to maintain deliveries and continuous product and process innovation 
in this environment  we believe that a key way we will grow is by becoming highly operationally effective and efficient 
we are now in the second year after the implementation of our global information system which became operational for most of our personal care segment in september 
we continue to devote substantial internal resources to extending the functionality and performance of the system 
we believe that timely and effective change and evolution in our systems will increase the total value proposition we offer to our customers and consumers  and thus increase our competitive advantage 
over the last year  we pursued two key initiatives to extend the reach of our business information systems 
first  we converted our housewares division to our new systems 
our housewares segment distribution and logistics requirements differ significantly from our traditional personal care segment business 
in our housewares segment  we were required to improve our ability to deliver larger  more complex 
table of contents assortments in smaller individual item volumes to a much more diverse group of retailers  as compared to our personal care segment 
the systems change over for the housewares segment occurred in mid february conversions of this nature involve extremely complex processes  characterized by interruptions and the diversion of management s attention for a period of time after the conversion as the organization adapts to the new system and seeks to respond quickly to its day to day operations requirements 
during the initial months after the transition  we experienced some warehouse order processing and shipment delays resulting from software issues and adapting to the new equipment  new employees  and the operation of the new distribution facility 
we continue to implement several significant functionality enhancements related to the housewares segment s systems  and expect this process to continue during fiscal our second key initiative over the past year has been to consolidate and rationalize our us domestic distribution capability 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we began construction of a  square foot distribution facility in southaven  mississippi 
in november  we took possession of the completed facility 
since then we have been transferring inventories to the new facility in stages 
we now ship our houseware  grooming  skin care  and hair care products out of the new facility 
our next transition will be to move the balance of our domestic hair care appliance inventory from our existing  square foot facility in southaven to the new  square foot facility 
the new facility represents a complete  state of the art distribution system and a significant additional technology investment for the company 
when fully matured  the new facility will become a seamless physical extension of our information technology system  and significantly extend our flexibility and effectiveness in serving our customers by delivering the right product  in the right quantities  at the right price and the right time 
we believe these efforts and investments continue to stage us for the next level of growth as we now have an infrastructure well poised to handle additional shipment volume 
over the next fiscal year  our internal focus will be to integrate our latin american operations into our operating system  and to look at additional opportunities to increase the efficiency of our supply chain through improved systems and processes 
our housewares and personal care products businesses have begun to benefit from each segment s industry specific expertise as we select best practices from each segment s business on how to bring new product to market 
we believe there are continued opportunities for increasing our efficiency and eliminating cost from our processes through streamlining and careful process consolidation of both segment s supply chain operations 
financial highlights from fiscal consolidated net sales increased percent  or  to  in fiscal versus  in fiscal our housewares segment provided percentage points of consolidated net sales growth  or  over a full year of operations 
our personal care segment experienced a decline in sales of percent  or  which is a percentage point reduction based on consolidated net sales 
from a geographic perspective  net sales in the united states grew percent  or  latin america grew percent  or  canada grew percent  or  and european and other international operations principally the united kingdom experienced an overall percent decline in net sales  or  our net sales growth includes the benefit of a net positive foreign exchange impact of  
table of contents consolidated operating income declined percent or  under the prior year 
the change was due to increased cost of goods sold and increased selling  general and administrative costs 
key elements of increased cost of goods sold were raw materials price increases and product mix changes 
key elements of increased selling  general and administrative costs were increased personnel costs partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs  higher depreciation and amortization  increased media advertising  higher warehousing costs  higher outbound freight costs  increased property rental expense  and non recurring costs associated with the consolidation of inventories and their transition to our new  square foot distribution facility in southaven  mississippi 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase was the result of recognizing a full year s worth of interest cost associated with our oxo acquisition  higher variable interest rates  and of irs interest costs incurred due to the settlement of a tax audit 
other income expense  net was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal significant items contributing to the fiscal amount were of interest income on an income tax refund  of income from a favorable litigation settlement  a gain on the sale of a distribution facility of  and a loss on a bankruptcy settlement of  significant items in the fiscal amount included an unrealized loss on marketable securities of  interest income of  and other miscellaneous income of income tax expense was  in fiscal  or percent of earnings before income taxes  compared to  in fiscal  or percent of earnings before income taxes 
the decrease in income tax was due to significantly lower earnings before income taxes  the trend of realizing more of our income in lower tax rate jurisdictions  and tax losses in certain higher tax rate jurisdictions 
these impacts were offset by  of additional us taxes arising from a repatriation of  in foreign earnings as allowed under the american jobs creation act of as a result of the items noted above  our net earnings decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal or  in percentage terms  by percent below the prior year 
our diluted earnings per share decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  or by percent 
personal care segment appliances 
products in this group include electronic curling irons  thermal brushes  hair straighteners  hair crimpers  hair dryers  massagers  spa products  foot baths  electric clippers and trimmers 
net sales for fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal the primary reason for the revenue decline was our response to competitive pricing pressures both domestically and abroad  a loss of product placement  weak market conditions in the united kingdom where key retailers ended calendar with significant excess retail inventories  and high customer returns in the first quarter of fiscal vidal sassoon  revlon  hot tools  dr 
scholl s  sunbeam  and health o meter were key brands in this group 
grooming  skin care  and hair products 
net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal the gains were the result of the launch of new items and packaging in the us and latin america for our brut and sea breeze brands to which we are giving focused advertising support 
latin american brut growth was exceptionally strong  with sales growth up percent for the fiscal year when compared to fiscal results 
including the us and canada  brut sales grew 
table of contents percent for fiscal overall when compared to fiscal results 
our grooming  skin care  and hair care portfolio includes the following brands brut  sea breeze  skin milk  vitalis  ammens  condition in  final net  vitapointe  timeblock and epil stop 
brushes  combs  and accessories 
net sales for fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal the drop was primarily due to certain customers moving to other sourcing alternatives 
we continue to aggressively market a new line of revlon accessories and other product initiatives to reverse the sales trend 
we are emphasizing promotional placements across all channels of distribution with key branded products  which we believe is helping us to secure new business in selected accounts 
vidal sassoon  revlon and karina were key brands in this group 
housewares segment the housewares segment s reported net sales were  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we acquired oxo on june  therefore  our reported net sales for fiscal did not include the net sales of oxo for the three months ended may   which was  on a fully comparable period basis  our housewares segment sales would be  for fiscal versus  for the comparable months in fiscal  for a net sales increase of percent 
growth was driven by continued extension of our business within existing key customers and the addition of a new line of hand tools featuring our highly desired non slip good grips comfort and ergonomic design  which had significant initial shipments in the second half of fiscal in addition to our new line of hand tools  we expanded our tea kettle line and introduced a line of unique silicone based textile kitchen mitts and trivets which have been well received 
good grips  oxo steel and oxo softworks are our key brands in this group 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we began the implementation and transition of our housewares segment to our own internal management system 
the transition was completed late in the fourth fiscal quarter of and included a conversion of the warehousing  order fulfillment and shipment processes for our oxo products to our new global enterprise resource planning system and the physical movement of inventory from a leased managed distribution facility in illinois to the company s new distribution facility in southaven  mississippi 
we continue to implement several significant functionality enhancements related to the housewares segment s systems and expect this process to continue during fiscal during the initial months after the transition of our housewares segment to the new systems and our distribution facility in southaven  mississippi  we experienced warehouse order processing and shipment delays 
these delays were the result of both software issues and adapting to the new equipment  new employees  and the operation of our new distribution facility 
in response to these issues  management dedicated additional personnel and sent a seasoned operations management team to southaven  mississippi to assist local management in resolving technical and operational issues 
the delays did cause a backlog in orders and in some cases  order cancellations 
we continue to work this backlog down 
we believe that the impact was immaterial in the fourth quarter of fiscal  however  we do expect some impact in the first fiscal quarter of due to lost revenue and costs associated with related concessions and accommodations to certain customers  and associated start up costs of the distribution center 
the extent of the impact on the first fiscal quarter of is not yet determinable 
we continue to work the backlog down  and expect operations to normalize in fiscal we have addressed these issues with the affected customers and believe that over the long term  the strength of our customer relationships will not be affected by the shipment delays 

table of contents while we believe we have taken appropriate measures to mitigate the recent shipment disruptions arising from the transition of our housewares segment  there can be no assurance that additional disruptions will not occur

in fiscal  we sold certain niche products through various channels of distribution that accounted for  in fiscal net sales 
we evaluated the financial results and effort required for this business and decided not to continue marketing these products 
we phased out of the business towards the end of fiscal and had insignificant sales activity in fiscal additionally  fourth quarter sales for fiscal were negatively impacted by softer than expected holiday season sales across many categories of merchandise for certain retailers 
this  in turn  resulted in lower sales to these retailers in late january and early february as the customers lowered their overall inventory levels

net sales in the united kingdom accounted for  of the european and other consolidated net sales decline due to weak retail market conditions in most of our personal care segment product categories exacerbated by key retailers ending calendar with significant excess retail inventories 
with the exception of the united kingdom  we saw net sales growth in remaining european and other foreign markets in which we operate

table of contents gross profit margins gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the percent decrease in gross profit was due to a combination of the higher costs of customer promotion programs which reduced net sales  a reduction in sales prices on certain key items in order to maintain our competitive position  and price increases on raw materials used in our grooming  skin care  and hair products 
overall  margins benefited from favorable currency exchange rates  however  exchange rates were not as favorable in as they were in the canadian dollar  brazil real and mexican peso were all a source of exchange rate gains 
these gains where somewhat offset by unfavorable exchange rates for the british pound and euro in the second half of fiscal in fiscal  almost all of our products were purchased in us dollars 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a combination of sales mix changes to higher margin items resulting from the acquisition of six liquid and powder hair and skin care brands from the procter gamble company in october  the brut acquisition in september and the oxo acquisition in june  selected product cost decreases  and new item introductions at higher margins  all of which were partially offset by selling price decreases on selected items 
favorable currency exchange rates for the british pound and euro also helped improve margins in fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  percent of international sales were in british pounds or euros

selling  general  and administrative expense sg a sg a increased to percent of net sales in fiscal from percent in fiscal the percent increase in sg a between fiscal and fiscal was principally due to increased personnel expenses partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs  higher depreciation associated with our new information system  increased advertising  higher warehouse costs due to the use of outside third party warehouses to manage and distribute certain inventories which were consolidated into our new  square foot distribution facility in mississippi as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  non recurring moving and start up costs incurred in fourth fiscal quarter in connection with the physical transition to the new distribution facility  higher outbound freight costs primarily from a sharp rise in fuel surcharges

operating profit for each operating segment is computed based on net sales  less cost of goods sold  less any selling  general  and administrative expenses associated with the segment 
the selling  general  and administrative expenses used to compute each segment s operating profit are comprised of sg a expense directly associated with those segments  plus overhead expenses that are allocable to operating segments 
in connection with the acquisition of oxo  we agreed that world kitchen  inc would perform certain corporate functions for oxo for a transitional period of time 
the costs of these functions are reflected in sg a for the housewares segment s operating income 
these costs were incurred through the end of fiscal during this transitional period  we did not make an allocation of our corporate overhead to oxo 
we expect to begin making allocations of our corporate overhead to oxo during the first fiscal quarter of since the transition services provided by world kitchen  inc have terminated and will be assumed by helen of troy internally going forward 
as a result of these allocations  there may be some reduction in operating income for the housewares segment  offset by an equal increase in operating income for the personal care segment 
the extent of this operating income impact between the segments has yet to be determined

table of contents sg a as previously discussed  accounted for the decrease in operating income in fiscal from fiscal in fiscal  increases in sg a  as previously discussed  accounted for most of the decline from fiscal the housewares segment s operating income increased  or percent for fiscal compared to fiscal  of the increase was due to the inclusion of the first fiscal quarter s operations in fiscal  while fiscal did not include first quarter operations since we did not acquire oxo until june  gross profit declined due to product mix as oxo expanded its food preparation business  adding a number of items which have lower margins  but carry higher price points 
in  oxo incurred price increases from certain suppliers due to increases in resin and stainless steel materials prices 
the housewares segment s operating income as a percentage of the segment s net sales was and percent for fiscal and  respectively 
the houseware segment s decline in operating income as a percentage of the segment s net sales was percent in fiscal over fiscal this was principally due to higher warehouse costs due to the use of outside third party warehouses to manage and distribute certain inventories which were consolidated into our new  square foot distribution facility as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  and one time moving and start up costs incurred in the fourth fiscal quarter in connection with the physical transition to the new distribution facility 
interest expense and other income expense interest expense increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the overall increase in interest expense is the result of the inclusion of a full year s interest expense from the use of both short term and long term debt to fund the fiscal acquisitions  of interest incurred on irs tax payments made to settle tax disputes related to prior years see note to our consolidated financial statements  and an increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt

table of contents fiscal year interest income was higher than the previous year primarily due to the receipt of of interest on an income tax refund 
interest income continued to trend lower in fiscal and due to lower levels of temporarily invested cash being held each year 
realized and unrealized losses on securities for fiscal included a loss on marketable securities acquired in connection with the sale of tactica see note to our consolidated financial statements  and of unrealized losses on other securities 
the principal items comprising miscellaneous other income for fiscal includes a gain on the sale of a distribution facility of  see note to our consolidated financial statements offset by a loss on a bankruptcy settlement of  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
realized and unrealized losses on securities for fiscal included a  loss on marketable securities acquired in connection with the sale of tactica see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these marketable securities carried a restriction that prevented us from disposing of the stock prior to july   and were accordingly classified as stock available for sale 
at acquisition  the securities had a market value of  at february   the market value of these securities was management determined the decline in market value to be other than temporary and accordingly recorded the  loss 
we recorded other income of and  in fiscal and  respectively  for favorable litigation settlements 
we pursued these cases in order to protect certain trademark and other intangible property rights we own 
income tax expense our fiscal income tax expense was percent of net income before taxes  continuing a trend towards lower rates over the past years 
the current year s rate is substantially lower than the percent and percent rates that we experienced in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline was due to the continuing trend of more of our income in fiscal and being taxed in lower tax rate jurisdictions as non us operations continue to become a larger portion of our business 
the company established a macao offshore company moc and began operating from macao in the third quarter of fiscal as a moc we have been granted an indefinite tax holiday and currently pay no taxes 
in addition  in fiscal we incurred tax losses in certain higher rate jurisdictions  this impact was offset somewhat by  of additional us tax arising from our fourth quarter repatriation of  in foreign earnings as allowed under the american jobs creation act of see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal we decreased our tax accruals by  due to the settlement reached with the united states internal revenue service for fiscal years through had these accruals not been adjusted  our income tax expense for fiscal would have been percent of net income before taxes 
discontinued operations as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  on april  we completed the sale of our percent interest in tactica back to certain shareholder operating managers 
in exchange for our percent share of tactica and the release of  of its secured debt and accrued interest owed to us  we received marketable securities  intellectual properties  and the right to certain tax refunds

total debt is defined as all debt outstanding at the balance sheet date 
this includes the sum of the following lines on our consolidated balance sheets current portion of long term debt and long term debt  less current portion 
for further information regarding this financing  see notes    and to our consolidated financial statements and our discussion below under financing activities 
operating activities our cash balance was  at the end of fiscal compared to  at the end of fiscal operating activities provided  of cash during fiscal  compared to  during fiscal in fiscal  our accounts receivable decreased  to  while our accounts receivable turnover increased to days from days in fiscal this calculation is based on a rolling five quarter accounts receivable balance 
we have experienced a trend towards increase in domestic and international receivable turnover days due to retail shipping requirements and marketing  promotional  and incentive programs we offer to remain competitive 
this has required more follow through and collections management on each account in order to help our customers resolve billing issues and properly issue and apply any credits due customers 
we also experienced collection delays in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal associated with the conversion to new information systems 
we believe these issues were resolved as we gained operating experience with the new systems 
these processes have extended our collection cycle  but have not had a negative impact on our overall credit quality or ultimate collection rates 
our international business primarily from european and latin american countries has longer credit terms than our domestic business 
in fiscal  net income provided sufficient operating capital to fund  of inventory growth 
over the fiscal year  inventory turnover decreased to from in fiscal the decreased turns were caused by inventory increases incurred to build up certain inventories due to new product introductions and to buffer against any disruptions in late fiscal and early fiscal from our relocation of certain inventories 
table of contents as we consolidated our warehouse operations into our new southaven  mississippi distribution facility 
in addition  in some product categories  we increased our purchases to take advantage of favorable current prices  which we expect may increase as a result of recent increases in petroleum prices and the prices of raw materials such as copper  steel and plastics 
working capital increased to  at the end of fiscal compared to  at the end of fiscal our current ratio increased to in fiscal from in fiscal our current ratio increased because our current assets grew in percentage terms faster than our current liabilities and long term debt 
investing activities in fiscal  investing activities used  of cash compared with  used in fiscal listed below are some significant highlights of our investing activities during the second fiscal quarter of  we commenced construction of a  square foot distribution facility in southaven  mississippi 
on november  we took possession of the completed facility paying a final purchase price of  total costs of the project  including warehouse equipment and fixtures was  the project was funded out of a combination of cash from operations  our existing revolving line of credit and draws against  of industrial revenue bonds  as further discussed under note to our consolidated financial statements and the proceeds from the sale of our existing facility in southaven  mississippi  as discussed below 
on february   we sold a  square foot distribution facility in southaven  mississippi for  recording a gain on the sale of  we are currently in the process of transitioning the operations in this facility to the new distribution facility discussed above 
we entered into a temporary lease agreement with the new owners through april calling for monthly rentals of per month including insurance and property tax payments 
after april  we will pay rent for this facility on a month to month basis  as required in order for us to complete our transition of operations to our new facility 
for the fiscal year  we incurred capital expenditures of on our global enterprise resource planning system 
capital expenditures on this system have moderated over levels of spending in the past two years 
we expect to continue to invest in functionality enhancements to the new system in the quarters to follow 
also during the latest fiscal year  we spent converting oxo to the new system 
we currently estimate the balance of costs yet to be incurred on enhancements and the oxo conversion to be in fiscal  we also invested  in new molds and tooling  on distribution equipment and material handling systems at our existing operational facilities   on general computer software and hardware and  for recurring additions and or replacements of fixed assets in the normal and ordinary course of business

for instance  a percent increase in interest rates could add  per year to floating rate interest expense over the next year 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no existing activities involving special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
current and future capital needs based on our current financial condition and current operations  we believe that cash flows from operations and available financing sources will continue to provide sufficient capital resources to fund the company s foreseeable short and long term liquidity requirements 
we expect our capital needs to stem primarily from the need to purchase sufficient levels of inventory and to carry normal levels of accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
in addition  we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities on a regular basis and may augment our internal growth with acquisitions of complementary businesses or product lines 
we may finance acquisition activity with available cash  the issuance of common shares  or with additional debt  depending upon the size and nature of any such transaction and the status of the capital markets at the time of such acquisition 
non monetary transactions we occasionally enter into barter transactions in which we exchange inventory for various services  usually advertising 
during fiscal  we entered into two such transactions in which we exchanged inventory with a book value of  for certain advertising credits 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded both sales and cost of goods sold equal to the exchanged inventory s net book value  which approximated their fair value 
at the end of  the remaining credits were valued at on our consolidated balance sheets  and were included in the line item entitled prepaid assets 
as of february  
table of contents all credits from the non monetary transactions had been utilized 
we have used   and  of barter related advertising credits during fiscal  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we consider the following policies to meet this definition 
allowance for accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or our judgment regarding their financial condition was to change negatively  additional allowances may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve or our judgment regarding their financial condition was to change positively  a reduction in the allowances may be required resulting in an increase in income in the period such determination was made 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is increased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of other complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts are unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
estimates of credits to be issued to customers we regularly receive requests for credits from retailers for returned products or in connection with sales incentives  such as cooperative advertising and volume rebate agreements 
we reduce sales or increase selling  general  and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the credits  for estimated future credits to customers 
our estimates of these amounts are based either on historical information about credits issued  relative to total sales  or on specific knowledge of incentives offered to retailers 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
valuation of inventory we account for our inventory using a first in first out system in which we record inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of its average cost or its net realizable value 
determination of net realizable value requires us to estimate the point in time at which an item s net realizable value drops below its cost 
we regularly review our inventory for slow moving items and for items that we are unable to sell at prices above their original cost 
when we identify such an item  we reduce its book value to the net amount 
table of contents that we expect to realize upon its sale 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
carrying value of long lived assets we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in assessing the carrying values of our long lived assets 
sfas and sfas both require that we consider whether circumstances or conditions exist which suggest that the carrying value of a long lived asset might be impaired 
if such circumstances or conditions exist  further steps are required in order to determine whether the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
if analyses indicate that the asset s carrying value does exceed its fair market value  the next step is to record a loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
the steps required by sfas and sfas entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity 
we completed our analysis of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal  and accordingly  recorded no impairment 
economic useful life of intangible assets we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  in determining the useful economic lives of intangible assets that we acquire and that we report on our consolidated balance sheets 
sfas requires that we amortize intangible assets  such as licenses and trademarks  over their economic useful lives  unless those assets economic useful lives are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is deemed to be indefinite  that asset is not amortized 
when we acquire an intangible asset  we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our previously acquired intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 
the determination of the economic useful life of an intangible asset requires a significant amount of judgment and entails significant subjectivity and uncertainty 
we have completed our analysis of the remaining useful economic lives of our intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal and determined that the useful lives currently being used to determine amortization of each asset are appropriate 
for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  we encourage you to read note included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
note contains several other policies  including policies governing the timing of revenue recognition  that are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  but do not meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments 
new accounting guidance refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates are our primary financial market risks 
fluctuation in interest rates causes variation in the amount of interest that we can earn on our available cash and the amount of interest expense we incur on our short term and long term borrowings 
interest on our long term debt outstanding as of february  is both floating and fixed 
fixed rates are in place on  of senior notes at rates ranging from percent to percent 
floating rates are in place on  of senior notes 
interest rates on these notes are reset quarterly based on the three month libor rate plus basis points for the five and seven year notes  and the three month libor rate plus basis points for the ten year notes 
interest rates during the latest fiscal year on these notes ranged from to percent for the five and seven year notes  and to percent for the ten year notes 
on march   the interest rates on these notes were reset for the next three months at percent for the five and seven year notes and percent for the ten year notes 
increases in interest rates expose us to risk on this debt 
also  with respect to  of fixed rate senior notes  as interest rates drop below the rates on this debt  our interest cost can exceed the cost of capital of companies who borrow at lower rates of interest 
as mentioned under note to our consolidated financial statements  we have a five year   revolving credit facility   of floating rate senior debt with five  seven  and ten year maturities  and  have recently secured an additional equipment credit facility that will allow us to draw up to  which will later convert to five year bonds when fully drawn 
the credit facilities  senior debt  and bonds bear floating rates of interest 
a percent increase in our base interest rates could impact us by adding up to  of additional interest cost annually assuming we fully draw on our  equipment financing 
the addition of these levels of debt exposure to our consolidated operations  and the uncertainty regarding the level of our future interest rates  substantially increases our risk profile 
because we purchase a majority of our inventory using us dollars  we are subject to minimal short term foreign exchange rate risk in purchasing inventory 
however  long term declines in the value of the us dollar could subject us to higher inventory costs 
such an increase in inventory costs could occur if foreign vendors were to react to such a decline by raising prices 
sales in the united states are transacted in us dollars 
the majority of our sales in the united kingdom are transacted in british pounds  in france and germany are transacted in euros  in mexico are transacted in pesos  in brazil are transacted in reals  and in canada are transacted in canadian dollars 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact sales  we are exposed to foreign exchange losses on those sales because our foreign currency sales prices are not adjusted for currency fluctuations 
when the us dollar weakens against those currencies  we could realize foreign currency gains 
our net sales denominated originally in currencies other than the us dollar totaled   and  during the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we incurred a foreign currency exchange gains losses of   and  during the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into a series of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for transactions designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value arising from the change in the spot rates from period to period is deferred in other comprehensive income 
these amounts are subsequently recognized in selling  general  and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income in the same period as the forecasted transactions close out over the remaining balance of their terms 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value arising from the change in the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate is 
table of contents recognized in the period it occurred 
these amounts are also recognized in selling  general  and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we do not enter into any forward exchange contracts or similar instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the following table summarizes the various forward contracts we designated as cash flow hedges that were open at the end of fiscal and february  weighted weighted average market value of the contract currency notional contract range of maturities spot rate at contract spot rate at feb

change in fair value due to a movement in forward rates in thousands favorable unfavorable british pound hedges this table is for risk analysis purposes and does not purport to represent actual losses or gains in fair value that we will incur 
it is important to note that the change in value represents the estimated change in the fair value of the contracts 
because the contracts hedge an underlying exposure  we would expect a similar and opposite change in foreign exchange gains or losses over the same period as the contract 
we expect that as currency market conditions warrant  and our foreign denominated transaction exposure grows  we will continue to execute additional contracts in order to hedge against potential foreign exchange losses
