item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading owner and operator of short line and regional freight railroads in the united states  canada  mexico  australia and bolivia 
in addition  we provide freight car switching and rail related services to industrial companies in the united states 
successful execution of our operating and growth strategies in led to the tenth consecutive year of record net income 
significant financial achievements for the year compared to the year included n revenue growth of to million n net income growth of to million revenues the million increase in our revenues was derived from growth from existing operations as well as the contribution from acquisitions 
on june   we completed our largest ever acquisition in north america when we acquired rail partners from rmc 
the revenue contribution from the rail partners properties  as well as other properties acquired during and  provided million  or  of the year over year growth in revenues in same railroad growth is the change in our revenues year over year associated with our existing operations ie  excluding the impact of acquisitions 
it is an important indicator of our performance as it is a measure of our ability to increase revenues from our existing operations 
same railroad freight revenues and total revenues increased and  respectively  in the increase in same railroad revenues was primarily due to an improvement in the price environment  higher fuel surcharges  and favorable exchange rate movements 
growth in same railroad revenues provided million  or  of the year over year growth in revenues in net income north american net income increased to million in compared to million in of this million increase  million came from an increase in pre tax profit  with the remainder due to a reduction in the effective tax rate in north america from to 
the reduction in effective tax rate was primarily associated with us tax legislation that created a track maintenance tax credit for short line railroads 
equity income from international affiliates decreased million to million in compared to million in  primarily due to a million decrease in net income from arg 
arg revenues were most significantly impacted by lower freight revenues from grain traffic in compared to  partially offset by strong growth in freight revenues from iron ore traffic 
higher fuel expense  as well as the cost of hiring and training new locomotive drivers also impacted results 
impact of hurricanes our us operations suffered modest damage as a result of hurricanes rita  katrina  and wilma 
higher fuel prices in their aftermath were the most significant impact 
however  our mexico operations were significantly impacted by hurricane stan in the fourth quarter of we sustained damage to bridges and lost approximately miles of track 
the damaged line is expected to be out of service for the entire year in outlook for in  we anticipate the positive impact of a full year of operation from the north american acquisitions made during and a continuing favorable rail pricing environment in north america 
with respect to the financial impact of the australia transactions  we expect n an increase in revenues due to the consolidation of the results of gwa following our acquisition of wesfarmers interests in gwa  n a reduction in equity income due to the arg sale  and n a reduction in our interest expense due to repayment of borrowings under our us credit facilities and an increase in interest income due to higher cash balances  both related to the anticipated uses of the proceeds from the australia transactions 
changes in operations united states rail partners on june   we acquired rail partners from rmc for million in cash net of million cash received  the assumption of million of non interest bearing debt and million in acquisition form k genesee wyoming inc costs 
the purchase price was allocated to current assets million  including million in cash received  property and equipment million  and intangible assets million  less current liabilities million and debt assumed million 
the intangible assets consist of customer contracts and relationships with a weighted average amortization period of years 
as contemplated with the acquisition  we implemented a severance program 
the aggregate cost of the severance program was considered a liability assumed in the acquisition  and as such  was included in the purchase price 
for us tax purposes  we will treat the rail partners acquisition as a purchase of assets 
we funded the purchase price through a combination of borrowings under our million senior revolving credit facility and from a private placement of million year senior floating rate notes the acquisition notes 
the acquired rail properties are operated by our jacksonville based rail link region and commenced operations on june  first coast railroad inc on april   our subsidiary  the first coast railroad inc fcrd signed a year agreement to lease miles of rail line between seals  georgia and fernandina  florida from csx transportation  inc csx 
the fcrd is operated by our rail link region and commenced operations on april  homer city branch in july  our homer city branch  which is located in homer city  pennsylvania  began operations upon completion of track rehabilitation  a portion of which was funded through government grants 
the homer city branch rail line  which we acquired in january for approximately  from csx  is operated by our new york pennsylvania region and is contiguous to that region s existing railroad operation 
pawnee transloading company inc on december   our newly formed subsidiary  pawnee transloading company inc pawnee acquired the assets of a coal and slag unloading facility in kincaid  illinois from legere investors  inc the facility serves one of our freight customers in our illinois region

in conjunction with the acquisition  we entered into two transportation services agreements tsas which are year agreements for the gp railroads to provide rail transportation service to gp 
one of the tsas has been determined to be an intangible asset and approximately million of the purchase price has been allocated to this asset 
this tsa asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over a year life  which is the expected life of the plant being served  beginning january  no value was assigned to the other tsa 
australia on february   we announced that we and wesfarmers had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our western australia operations and certain other assets of arg to queensland rail and babcock brown limited for approximately million  plus certain closing adjustments estimated to be approximately million arg sale 
the arg sale is subject to customary closing conditions  including certain australian government approvals  and is expected to close in the second quarter of the buyers have made a deposit of approximately million  which will be fully credited towards the purchase price 
simultaneous with the arg sale  we entered into an agreement to purchase wesfarmers percent ownership of the remaining arg operations  which are principally located in south australia and the northern territory for approximately million gwa purchase  collectively with the arg sale  the australia transactions 
this business  which will be based in adelaide  will be renamed genesee wyoming australia pty ltd gwa and will be a percent owned subsidiary that is reported on a consolidated basis in our financial statements 
we anticipate approximately million in after tax cash proceeds from the arg sale 
we currently intend to use a portion of the proceeds to i fund the genesee wyoming inc form k gwa purchase and ii repay all debt outstanding under our million senior revolving credit facility  the balance of which was million as of december  we currently intend to use the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
on december   awb publicly announced that it is subject to an australian government investigation stemming from allegations that it participated in illegal transactions with the prior iraqi regime in connection with awb s participation in the united nations oil for food program 
the government commission conducting the investigation is scheduled to issue its report on march  in addition to criminal and civil sanctions  the australian government may revoke awb s legally sanctioned exclusive control over the export of australian wheat 
pursuant to the terms of two separate contracts between arg and awb one for western australia and one for south australia  if awb loses its sole exporter status  under certain circumstances  it has the right to re negotiate the terms of the contracts with arg 
we are continuing to assess the impact of the investigation on arg s demand for our services and the potential impact of a renegotiation of the contracts 
mexico during the first week of october  hurricane stan impacted five states in mexico  including the state of chiapas  causing damage to portions of fccm s operations 
the most severe impact to fccm is concentrated in chiapas  between the town of tonal and the guatemalan border  some miles to the south 
fccm performed a survey of the property and determined approximately bridges on that section of track have been damaged and at least miles of track has been lost due to washouts 
as a result  this mile segment south of tonal is inoperable 
the remaining operations of fccm s  mile network are unaffected 
due to the damage to the chiapas line  fccm lost approximately  carloads during the fourth quarter of the revenue impact of this loss of traffic in the fourth quarter of was approximately million 
in addition to lost revenue  fccm incurred additional operating costs in the fourth quarter related to the storm s impact covering matters such as car hire and additional security  a portion of which is covered by our insurance 
the after tax impact of the storm in the fourth quarter of on net income was approximately million  net of anticipated recovery from insurance proceeds 
fccm operates pursuant to a concession agreement  meaning it does not own the track  bridges or related materials damaged by the hurricane 
accordingly  fccm believes it has no legal obligation to reconstruct the damaged line and fccm s failure to reconstruct the damaged line is not cause for terminating the concession agreement 
however  to facilitate a rapid return of rail transportation to the chiapas region  fccm is working with the mexican government on a plan to reconstruct the line 
this plan contemplates that reconstruction would take five to seven months once an agreement on funding has been finalized with the government 
although it does not own the track or bridges over which it operates in mexico  fccm did carry property insurance on the track and bridges underlying its concession agreement 
fccm has offered to contribute the insurance proceeds it may receive for the track and bridge damage towards the cost of the complete reconstruction 
however  the full cost of restoration will exceed the insurance proceeds available  and fccm is seeking government funding for the balance 
we can provide you no assurance that the mexican government will provide the remaining funding or provide such funding in a timely manner 
the book value of the assets associated with the damaged line is less than million 
in light of these circumstances we will continue to review our long lived assets in mexico for impairment 
because of the uncertainty around the timing of the conclusion of the reconstruction discussions with the mexican authorities  we believe the damaged line in chiapas will remain out of service for the remainder of results of operations when comparing our results of operations from one reporting period to another  you should consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to one time freight moves  customer plant expansions and shut downs  sales of land and equipment  accidents and derailments 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable to other periods 
also  we have completed and entered into a number of recent transactions which have changed and will change our operations 
because of variations in the structure  timing and size of these transactions our operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our operating results in other reporting periods 
certain of our commodity shipments are sensitive to general economic conditions in north america  including paper products in canada  chemicals in the united states  and cement in mexico 
however  shipments of other commodities are less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected other factors  such as inventory levels maintained at a customer power plant coal and winter weather salt

the notes will continue to be secured by essentially all the assets of servicios and fccm  and a pledge of the servicios and fccm shares held by us 
under the original loan agreements for million of debt  we were obligated to provide up to million of funding to our mexican subsidiaries  if necessary  to meet their investment or financial obligations prior to completing the investment phase of the project funded by the notes 
the investment phase consisted of achieving several obligations related to capital investments  operating performance and management systems and controls 
thereafter  we were obligated to provide up to million in funding to servicios to meet its debt service obligations prior to completing the financial phase of the project  which consisted of achieving several financial performance thresholds 
prior to the amendment  we had advanced million of our million obligation and the project was still in the investment phase 
the amended agreements eliminate our obligations to provide additional funding under those terms and instead obligate us to provide up to million to servicios in addition to the million previously advanced  if necessary  for servicios to meet its debt payment obligations 
to the extent that fccm s annual capital expenditures exceed of fccm s consolidated ebitda  as defined in the form k genesee wyoming inc amended agreements as determined on an annual basis  we are obligated to provide additional funds to fccm equal to the amount of such excess 
pursuant to this funding requirement  based on fccm s ebitda and capital expenditures  we will be obligated to advance million  full payment of which is due in the first quarter of furthermore  due to the impact of hurricane stan on our mexican operations  we currently expect our mexican operations will be able to fund only million of the total million of us dollar denominated principal and interest payments due in we anticipate fccm will use million of the million we are obligated to advance to fund its debt service shortfall 
fccm is not in default under the note documents as a result of the damage associated with hurricane stan but revenue and cash flow shortfalls  among other factors  may result in a default in the future 
in conjunction with the original financing  ifc invested million of equity in servicios for a indirect interest in fccm 
along with its equity investment  ifc received a put option exercisable in to sell its equity stake back to us 
the amendments extended the term of the put option from december  to december  the value of the servicios equity owned by ifc will be based on a multiple of fccm s ebitda as defined in the agreements 
exercise of this put option by ifc would result in a future cash outflow for us 
on march   we received notice that the ifc intends to exercise its put option to sell its indirect equity stake in fccm back to us 
we are still determining the cash outflow that would result from the closing of the exercise of the put option  but in no case will the cash outflow exceed million 
mexican fuel tax credits in  fccm could apply diesel fuel tax credits that it generated to reduce payroll taxes and value added taxes  and it utilized approximately million in such fuel tax credits 
during  tax authorities issued a ruling that limited the application of diesel fuel tax credits to income tax related obligations only  excluding payroll taxes and value added taxes 
effective january  as a result of new fuel tax legislation  fccm was again permitted to apply diesel fuel tax credits that it generates to reduce a variety of its federal tax obligations  including income taxes  payroll taxes and value added taxes 
while the new legislation was a favorable development  under the fuel tax formula at current high diesel fuel prices  fccm is paying little or no fuel taxes and therefore is not generating any significant diesel fuel tax credits 
fccm has utilized all the fuel tax credits it generated in and the small amount of fuel tax credits it generated in south america we have a indirect ownership interest in ferroviaria oriental  sa oriental which is located in eastern bolivia 
we hold our equity interest in oriental through a number of intermediate holding companies  and we account for our interest in oriental under the equity method of accounting 
we indirectly hold a equity interest in oriental through an interest in genesee wyoming chile gwc  and we hold our remaining equity interest in oriental through other companies 
gwc is an obligor of non recourse debt of million  which has an adjustable interest rate dependent on operating results of oriental 
this non recourse debt is secured by a lien on gwc s indirect equity interest in oriental 
this debt became due and payable on november  due to the political and economic unrest and uncertainties in bolivia  it has become difficult for gwc to refinance this debt and we have chosen not to repay the non recourse obligation 
gwc entered into discussions with its creditors on plans to restructure the debt  and as a result of those discussions  gwc obtained a written waiver of principal repayment from the creditors which expired on january  however  negotiations with the creditors continue  and currently  none of gwc s creditors have commenced court proceedings to i collect on the debt or ii exercise their rights pursuant to the lien 
gwc and the creditors have an informal standstill agreement until may  if there is no agreement between gwc and the creditors by that date  the creditors may exercise their rights pursuant to the lien 
if we were to lose our equity stake in oriental due to creditors exercising their lien on gwc s indirect equity interest in oriental  we would write off our investment in oriental held through gwc  which on december  amounted to  a default  acceleration or effort to foreclose on the lien under the non recourse debt will have no impact on our remaining equity interest in oriental because that equity interest is held indirectly through holding companies outside of gwc s ownership in oriental 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the million debt  we discontinued equity accounting for our equity interest in oriental held through our interest in gwc 
oriental has no obligations associated with the million debt 
in addition  a default  acceleration or effort to foreclose on the lien under the non recourse debt would not result in a breach of a representation  warranty  covenant  cross default or acceleration under our senior credit facility 
equipment leases we are party to several cancelable leases which have automatic renewal provisions 
if we choose not to renew these leases  we would be obligated to return the underlying rolling stock and pay aggregate fees of up to approximately million 
in addition  we have the option  at various dates  to terminate the leases by purchasing the genesee wyoming inc form k rolling stock 
the maximum aggregate purchase price  at the next available buyout date for each qualifying lease  is approximately million 
management anticipates the future market value of the leased rolling stock will equal or exceed the payments necessary to purchase the rolling stock 
as noted previously  in november  tzpr entered into a year lease agreement for the assets of the ppu see note to consolidated financial statements 
future lease payments of million annually are subject to adjustment based on certain economic indicators and customer operations stipulated in the agreement 
government grants some of our railroads have entered into a number of rehabilitation or construction grants with state and federal agencies 
we use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs 
in return for the grants  the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and maintenance on the rail lines that have been rehabilitated or constructed 
we believe that the levels of service and maintenance required under the grants are not materially different from those we would otherwise provide 
in addition to government grants  customers occasionally provide fixed funding of certain track rehabilitation or construction projects to facilitate our service over that track 
we record any excess in the fixed funding compared to the actual cost of rehabilitation and construction as gains in the current period 
however  we can offer no assurance that government grants will continue to be available or that even if available  our railroads will be able to obtain them 
we received government grants totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
budgeted capital expenditures we have budgeted approximately million million net of government grants in capital expenditures in  of which million million net of government grants is for track rehabilitation and million is for equipment 
if we are unable to obtain the expected government grants  we will also reduce our net budgeted capital expenditures 
we have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations  while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with amounts available under our credit facilities will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the credit facilities

if we identify impairment on an asset  we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset  as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances 
we closely monitor our assets in foreign operations where fluctuating currencies and unsettled economic conditions can create greater uncertainty 
intangible assets and goodwill acquired in business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates  and asset lives and therefore require considerable judgment 
these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment  since these assets are not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
specifically  we test for impairments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

we perform our annual impairment test on november th of each year and in no impairment was recognized 
for intangible assets  the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for goodwill  a two step impairment model is used 
we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired and we would then record the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
form k genesee wyoming inc derailment and property damages  personal injuries and third party claims we maintain insurance  with varying deductibles up to  per incident for liability and up to  per incident for property damage  for claims resulting from train derailments and other accidents related to our railroad and industrial switching operations 
accruals for fela claims by our railroad employees and third party personal injury or other claims  limited when appropriate to the applicable deductible  are recorded when such claims are determined to be probable and estimates are updated as information develops 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb for union and non union employees of two us subsidiaries 
in order to apply actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate applied to future liabilities and expected future rate of return on pension assets 
for other postretirement benefits  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions annually and our assumptions are based on the following factors n discount rate is based on a review of long term bonds  including published indices 
the discount rate determined on that basis was 
n expected return on plan assets is based on an assumed long term asset rate of return of 
n health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions and is assumed to be in graded ratably to over a seven year period 
stock based compensation we elected to adopt sfas r  in the third quarter of using the modified prospective application 
sfas r requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
prior to adoption we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under apb opinion  under which no compensation cost had been recognized and disclosed the pro forma expense for basic and diluted earnings per share as if stock based compensation had been compiled under sfas the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model and straight line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant 
two assumptions in the black scholes pricing model that require management judgment are the expected life and expected volatility of stock 
the expected life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant 
the expected volatility of stock is based on actual volatility and adjusted to reflect future expectations 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  the cumulative effect on current and prior periods will be recorded as compensation cost in the period of change 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
as of the adoption date  the impact of amortizing existing stock options in the year ended december  represented compensation cost of million pre tax  or million after tax  which reduced earnings by 
per share for the year ended december  the total compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized of million is expected to be recognized through june  amortization expense for the restricted stock shares was  for the year ended december  total unrecognized compensation cost for non vested restricted stock shares and restricted stock units of million is expected to be recognized through june  income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no

requires a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as available income tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
in our consolidated balance sheets  these deferred benefits and deferred obligations are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred tax assets related to carry forwards  are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year 
genesee wyoming inc form k no provision is made for the us income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to us income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
the amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december  was million 
we had net operating loss carry forwards from our mexican operations in and of million and million  respectively 
the mexican losses  for income tax purposes  relate to the immediate deduction of a portion of the purchase price paid for the fccm operations and interest expense incurred in the holding company  servicios 
these loss carry forwards will expire between and a significant portion of the deferred tax benefits relate to the mexican net operating loss carry forwards 
we believe a valuation allowance need not be recorded because we expect our mexican region will more likely than not generate sufficient taxable income to utilize all of the deferred tax assets 
we estimate fccm will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize its net operating loss carry forwards prior to the date of expiration 
in addition  management believes  in conjunction with a contemplated restructuring of the mexican region  we will more likely than not generate sufficient future taxable income to offset the remaining net operating losses of servicios prior to the date of expiration 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
other uncertainties our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in our forward looking statements 
for a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations  see item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
we use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone  nor do we use instruments where there are not underlying cash exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
we manage our hedging positions and monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
management believes that our use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in our best interest 
however  our use of derivative financial instruments may result in short term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk results from issuing variable rate debt obligations  since an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the table below provides amounts outstanding and corresponding interest rates for our fixed and variable rate debt and our use of interest rate swaps to mitigate increases in interest rates 
principal amount of long term debt and interest rate swaps dollars in thousands december  fixed rate debt  average fixed interest rate variable rate debt swapped to fixed rate debt  average fixed interest rate unswapped variable rate debt  average variable interest rate total long term debt  average interest rate amount of variable rate debt that we have swapped to fixed rate debt in is million

the borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of for debt under our us and canadian credit facilities  for our series c senior notes and for debt related to our mexican operations 
interest rate swaps the table presents dollar amounts outstanding under interest rate swaps as of december   in which we have swapped a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the table also presents the average fixed interest rate under these swaps which is equal to our fixed pay rates to counterparties plus our borrowing margin 
interest rate sensitivity based on the table above  assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates  annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately million 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our mexican operations is the mexican peso  while the debt obligations are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we face exchange rate risk if the mexican peso were to depreciate relative to the us dollar  thereby generating lower us dollar equivalent cash and earnings to pay the principal and interest on the debt 
our risk management policy seeks to mitigate this risk by purchasing one year forward currency options on the us dollar mexican peso exchange rate that approximate projected us dollar principal and interest payments that will be funded by available peso denominated cash  so as to lessen the impact of a severe peso depreciation 
debt related to our canadian and australian operations is denominated in the respective local currencies 
therefore  foreign currency risk related to debt service payments does not exist at our canadian and australian operations 
us dollar denominated principal and projected interest obligations of mexican peso denominated operations dollars in thousands thereafter total principal payments interest payments total principal and interest payments are due on march and september of each year

if the value of the mexican peso were to weaken ten percentage points relative to the us dollar while mexican peso denominated earnings and cash flows remained constant  then it would be equivalent to the mexican operations being required to support an additional  in debt service payments 
based on an exchange rate of mexican peso per us dollar as of december   this exposure in is capped at a maximum of  by the foreign currency options shown in the table 
genesee wyoming inc form k sensitivity of foreign currency translation gwi s mexican operations are held through two subsidiaries  servicios and fccm 
servicios is the obligor of the loan agreements with the ifc and fmo  while fccm is the operating company 
fccm is owned by servicios and by us 
servicios is owned by us and by the ifc 
fccm historically has made debt service payments on behalf of servicios 
when fccm makes a payment on servicios behalf  servicios provides fccm with a us dollar denominated note for the amount of the payment 
these notes bear interest at the same spread over libor as the underlying debt to the ifc and fmo  currently libor 
since fccm has the mexican peso as its functional currency  these notes are recorded on its balance sheet in mexican pesos 
when the mexican peso appreciates or depreciates relative to the us dollar fccm records a non cash loss or gain  respectively  on the note as it is revalued 
as of december   the total amount due to fccm from servicios was million 
a one percentage point appreciation in the mexican peso relative to the us dollar from the december  exchange rate would result in a pre tax loss for fccm in the amount of million 
diesel fuel price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices  since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows 
in the year ended december   fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented of our total expenses and of total expenses at our owned australian operations 
as of december   neither we nor our owned australian operations had entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk 
sensitivity to diesel fuel prices as of december   each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a  increase in our annual fuel expense and a  increase in arg s annual diesel fuel expense consumed in operations
