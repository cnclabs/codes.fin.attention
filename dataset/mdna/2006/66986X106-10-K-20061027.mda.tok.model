item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the discussion includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth in item a 
risk factors of this annual report  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
general novadel pharma inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel drug delivery systems for prescription and over the counter  or otc  drugs 
our oral spray therapeutics are administered by a novel application drug delivery systems for presently marketed prescription  otc  and veterinary drugs 
this patented and patent pending delivery system is an oral spray potentially enabling drug absorption through the oral mucosa  increasing the benefits of clinically proven compounds  including more rapid absorption into the bloodstream than presently available oral delivery systems 
our proprietary delivery system potentially enhances and accelerates the onset of the therapeutic benefits within minutes of administration 
our development efforts for our proprietary novel drug delivery system are concentrated on making such system available for drugs that are already available and proven in the marketplace 
we believe that our proprietary drug delivery system could offer the following significant advantages i more rapid delivery of drugs to the bloodstream allowing for quicker onset of therapeutic effects compared to conventional oral dosage forms  ii increased bioavailability of a drug by avoiding metabolism by the liver  iii improved drug safety profile by reducing the required dosage  including possible reduction of side effects  iv improved dosage reliability  v allowing medication to be taken without water  vi avoiding the need to swallow as is the case with many medications  and vii improved patient convenience and compliance 
currently  we have eight patents which have been issued in the us and patents which have been issued outside of the us additionally  we have over patents pending around the world 
since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from consulting activities  primarily in connection with product development for various pharmaceutical companies 
more recently  we have begun to derive revenues from license fees and milestone payments stemming from our partnership agreements 
our future growth and profitability will be principally dependent upon our ability to successfully develop our products and to market and distribute the final products either internally or with the assistance of a strategic partner 
on june   our board of directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from july to december accordingly  the new fiscal year will begin on january  and end on december we have filed our annual report on form k for the period ending july   and we intend to file a transition report on form k for the period ending december  highlights for our fiscal year ended july   and additionally through the date of filing for this annual report on form k  include the following product development and business achievements completed two pre investigational new drug application  or ind  meetings with the food and drug administration  fda  including meetings for our sumatriptan imitrex and zolpidem ambien product candidates 
in addition  we participated in a pre ind meeting with our partner hana biosciences  inc or hana biosciences  for the ondansetron zofran zensana product candidate 
announced that dr 
henry kwan would no longer serve as head of pharmaceutical sciences on october  filing an ind for ondansetron zensana through our partner  hana biosciences 
announced through our partner  hana biosciences  positive study results of a pivotal clinical trial for zensana ondansetron oral spray  a study which demonstrated zensana mg dose is bioequivalent to the current commercially available mg tablet zofran 
hana biosciences filed an nda for zensana which was accepted for review by the fda 
addition of jan egberts  md who assumed the positions of president and chief executive officer on december  and chairman of the board of directors on january  issued two patents by the us patent and trademark office and one additional patent in canada that further strengthens our intellectual property position in the oral delivery of pharmaceuticals 
the issued patents cover the use of multiple classes of drugs in oral sprays  including those for the treatment of pain  central nervous system disorders  and for anesthesia under our oral spray delivery system 
completed a private placement in april of our common stock  raising gross proceeds of approximately million 
on april   ms 
jean frydman ceased to serve as vice president  general counsel and corporate secretary 
received notice from the fda indicating acceptance of our new drug application  or nda  submission for our nitroglycerin lingual spray nitromist as a complete response and an indicated target date of november  for action on the submission 
added two new central nervous system product candidates to our development pipeline  including tizanidine oral spray potentially for spasticity and ropinirole oral spray potentially for parkinson s disease 
appointment of mr 
steven b 
ratoff as chairman of the board effective september  with dr 
egberts remaining a member of the board of directors 
announcement of positive study results of a pharmacokinetic study of our improved oral spray formulation of sumatriptan  a study which demonstrated that sumatriptan oral spray achieves a statistically significant faster rate of absorption than imitrex tablets 
drug development in the us and most countries throughout the world is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries 
the fda approval processes relating to new drugs differ  depending on the nature of the particular drug for which approval is sought 
with respect to any drug product with active ingredients not previously approved by the fda  a prospective drug manufacturer is required to submit an nda  which includes complete reports of pre clinical  clinical and laboratory studies to prove such product s safety and efficacy 
prior to submission of the nda  it is necessary to submit an ind  to obtain permission to begin clinical testing of the new drug 
given that our current product candidates are based on a new technology for formulation and delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients that have been previously approved and that have been shown to be safe and effective in previous clinical trials  we believe that we will be eligible to submit what is known as a b nda 
we estimate that the development of new formulations of our pharmaceutical product candidates  including formulation  testing and obtaining fda approval  will take two to three years for the b nda process and will require significantly lower investments in direct research and development expenditures than is the case for the discovery and development of new chemical entities 
however  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate  or pre marketing approval relating to our proposed products may not be obtained on a timely basis  if at all  and research and development expenditures may significantly exceed management s expectations 
it is not anticipated that we will generate any revenues from royalties or sales of our product candidates until regulatory approvals are obtained and marketing activities begin 
any one or more of our product candidates may not prove to be commercially viable  or if viable  may not reach the marketplace on a basis consistent with our desired timetables  if at all 
the failure or the delay of any one or more of our proposed products to achieve commercial viability would have a material adverse effect on us 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
estimates of the nature  timing and estimated expenses of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  and the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  results of future clinical trials  the expense of clinical trials for additional indications  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  the expense of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technologies and market developments  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the development of our product candidates and we expect our costs to increase as we continue to develop and ultimately commercialize our product candidates 
over the next fiscal year  we expect to devote the majority of our research and development resources to the following product candidates nitromist nitroglycerin lingual aerosol 
this product candidate is indicated for acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease 
we have partnered with par pharmaceutical  inc  or par  who has exclusive rights to market  sell and distribute nitromist in the us and canada 
on june   we received an approvable letter from the fda regarding our nda for nitromist 
the fda is not requiring any additional clinical studies for approval  but has requested that we complete certain manufacturing process validation commitments 
on april   we submitted the additional documentation to the fda for the manufacturing process validation commitments 
on may   we announced that the fda had accepted our submission regarding our nda as a complete response and  further  that the fda indicated a target date of november  for action on the submission 
we will receive a milestone payment from par should final approval from the fda be obtained 
in addition  we will receive royalty payments based upon a percentage of net sales 
zolpidem oral spray 
zolpidem is the active ingredient in ambien  the leading hypnotic marketed by sanofi aventis 
we are currently targeting a nda submission for our zolpidem product candidate in the first half of calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar sumatriptan oral spray 
sumatriptan is the active ingredient in imitrex which is the largest selling migraine remedy marketed by glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
we are currently targeting a nda submission for our sumatriptan product candidate in the second half of calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar  however  we will not be able to launch this product candidate until after the expiration of the relevant imitrex patents and extensions thereof in february tizanidine oral spray 
tizanidine is indicated for the treatment of spasticity  a symptom of several neurological disorders  including multiple sclerosis  spinal cord injury  stroke and cerebral palsy  and leads to involuntary tensing  stiffening and contracting of muscles 
tizanidine treats spasticity by blocking nerve impulses through pre synaptic inhibition of motor neurons 
this method of action results in decreased spasticity without a corresponding reduction in muscle strength 
because patients experiencing spasticity may have difficulty swallowing the tablet formulation of the drug  our tizanidine oral spray may provide patients suffering from spasticity with a very convenient solution to this serious treatment problem 
we are currently targeting a nda submission for our tizanidine product candidate in calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar ropinirole oral spray 
ropinirole is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic parkinson s disease 
ropinirole oral spray is ideal for the geriatric population who may be suffering from dysphagia difficulty swallowing  of sufferers of parkinson s are years of age or older and of elderly people have some difficulty in swallowing 
our formulation of ropinirole oral spray may represent a more convenient way for the patient or healthcare provider to deliver ropinirole to patients suffering stiffness and or tremors 
we are currently targeting a nda submission for our ropinirole product candidate in calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar we will also support our partners  as necessary  with the following product candidates and opportunities although we do not expect to devote a significant amount of corporate resources to such activities zensana ondansetron oral spray 
ondansetron is the active ingredient in zofran  the leading anti emetic marketed by gsk 
our partner for zensana  hana biosciences  is overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for this product in the us and canada 
in january  hana biosciences announced positive study results of a pivotal clinical trial for zensana 
hana biosciences submitted its nda on june  such nda was accepted for review by the fda in august hana biosciences is currently targeting final approval from the fda and commercial launch in calendar we will receive a milestone payment from hana biosciences upon final approval from the fda 
in addition  we will receive royalty payments based upon a percentage of net sales 
propofol oral spray 
propofol is the active ingredient in diprivan  the world s leading intravenous anesthetic marketed by astrazeneca 
we continue to support our partner  manhattan pharmaceuticals  inc  or manhattan pharmaceuticals  who will oversee all clinical development and regulatory approval for this product 
our partner has not provided guidance regarding the clinical and regulatory development plan for this product candidate 
our veterinary initiatives are being carried out largely by our partner  velcera pharmaceuticals  inc  or velcera 
our partner has not provided guidance regarding the clinical and regulatory development plan for the potential veterinary product candidates 
we plan to hire additional employees in the laboratory to support our research and development efforts going forward  however  we do not believe that a significant number of new employees will be required in the next months 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us this requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses which in the normal course of business are subsequently adjusted to actual results 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition we receive revenue from consulting services and license agreements 
consulting revenues from contract clinical research are recognized in the period in which the services are rendered  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
upfront license agreement payments are initially deferred and subsequently amortized into revenue over the contractual period 
milestone payments related to license agreements are recognized as revenue when earned 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which revises accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  which provided for the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for employees stock options 
sfas r required all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first quarter of the first annual reporting period that began after june  under sfas r  the use of the intrinsic value method and pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas r effective august  and have selected the black scholes method of valuation for share based compensation 
we have adopted the modified prospective transition method which does not require restatement of prior periods 
instead  it requires that compensation cost be recorded as earned for all unvested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r 
the charge is being recognized in research and development and consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the original estimate of fair value of the options as of the grant date 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb and related interpretations  to account for its stock options granted to employees 
under this method  compensation cost was recorded only if the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant exceeded the exercise price 
sfas established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for share based employee compensation plans 
as permitted by sfas  we elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above  and adopted only the disclosure requirements of sfas  as amended 
for the fiscal year ended july   we recorded share based compensation of approximately million or per share 
we will continue to incur share based compensation charges in future periods 
as of july   unamortized stock based compensation expenses of approximately million remain to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as a result of cashless exercise provisions in our employee stock option agreements  we used variable accounting treatment under the financial accounting standards board s interpretation  for issued and outstanding stock options from january through july on october   our board of directors rescinded the cashless exercise provision for all of our outstanding option grants 
through july   variable plan accounting continued to be applied for approximately  outstanding options  for which option exercise prices were modified from the original agreement 
the following table illustrates the pro forma effect on the company s net loss and net loss per share as if the company had adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based compensation under sfas for the fiscal years ended july  and fiscal year ended july  net loss as reported compensation credit resulting from variable plan accounting total share based employee compensation expense using the fair value based method for all awards pro forma net loss basic and diluted net loss per common share as reported pro forma net loss research and development expenses research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
results of operations fiscal years ended july  and license fees and milestone fees earned from related parties for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  the increase is primarily due to milestone payments received in connection with our license and development agreement for ondansetron with hana biosciences 
consulting revenues from related parties for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of revenue from velcera and manhattan pharmaceuticals  related to veterinary products and propofol  respectively 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended july  and nitromist zolpidem sumatriptan zensana propofol alprazolam tizanidine ropinirole other research and development costs internal costs total research and development expenses in the preceding table  research and development expenses are set forth in the following categories nitromist  zolpidem  sumatriptan  tizanidine and ropinirole third party direct project expenses relating to the development of the respective product candidates 
we expect to devote the majority of our research and development resources to our zolpidem and sumatriptan product candidates and expect that costs associated with these product candidates should increase in future periods  zensana and propofol third party direct project expenses relating to the development of zensana 
as our partners  hana biosciences and manhattan pharmaceuticals are overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for these product candidates  we do not expect to devote a significant amount of resources to these product candidates  alprazolam third party direct project expenses relating to the development of our alprazolam oral spray product candidate 
we have determined that  in order to devote sufficient resources to other product candidates  it is appropriate to defer further efforts on alprazolam  other research and development costs direct expenses not attributable to a specific product candidate  and internal costs costs related primarily to personnel and overhead 
we do not allocate these expenses to specific product candidates as these costs relate to all research and development activities 
research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended july  increased primarily as a result of the following items  increase related to process validation and method transfer activities for our nitromist product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our zolpidem product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our sumatriptan product candidate   increase related to other research and development costs primarily as a result of higher lab supplies expense   decrease related to our alprazolam product candidate as we have decided to defer further efforts on this product candidate  and  decrease related to internal costs primarily as a result of lower headcount in the fiscal year ended july   as compared to the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the increase in consulting  selling  general and administrative costs is primarily related to the following items  non cash charge in the fiscal year ended july  for stock compensation expense   decrease in outside legal costs  and  decrease attributable to a non cash charge recorded in the fiscal year ended july  for restricted shares of our common stock awarded to a consultant 
total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  primarily due to the net increases in research and development and selling general and administrative expenses noted above 
interest income for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for fiscal year ended july  due to a general increase in interest rates 
income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  these benefits resulted from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  fiscal years ended july  and license fees and milestone payments increased to  in the fiscal year ended july  from  in the fiscal year ended july  primarily due to the signing of new partnership agreements with hana biosciences and velcera in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended july consulting revenues for the fiscal year ended july  decreased to  in the fiscal year ended july  from  in the fiscal year ended july  primarily as a result of lower revenue from our arrangement with manhattan pharmaceuticals  partially offset by revenue associated with the company s arrangement with velcera 
research and development expenses increased approximately  to  from  for the fiscal year ended july  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily related to the following items approximate  increase  primarily related to pharmacokinetic studies completed in the fiscal year ended july  for three of our priority product candidates  including i zolpidem ambien  ii ondansetron zofran and iii alprazolam xanax  approximate  increase  primarily related to outsourced manufacturing fees associated with process validation and method transfer activities for our nitromist product candidate  approximate  increase due to higher payroll and allocated facility and administrative costs  primarily as a result of an increase in r d related personnel in the fiscal year ended july   and approximate  decrease in r d related consultants expense 
consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to  from  for the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the increase in consulting  selling  general and administrative costs is primarily related to the following items approximate  increase in outside legal costs  primarily related to the filing of additional patent applications in the fiscal year ended july approximate  increase in compensation expense related to variable accounting for stock options 
in the fiscal year ended july   we recognized a credit of  as compared to a credit of  in the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in the credit is primarily attributable to a significant reduction in the fiscal year ended july  of the number of stock options that are subject to variable accounting   non cash charge to consultants expense in the fiscal year ended july  for restricted shares of our common stock awarded to a consultant  and the remaining increase  net of individually offsetting items of lesser significance  is primarily attributable to higher payroll  recruiting and relocation expenses as a result of hiring additional employees 
primarily as a result of the factors described above  total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended july  increased approximately  to approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended july  interest income decreased approximately  to  for the fiscal year ended july  from  for the fiscal year ended july  due to lower average cash and investment balances 
income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended july  was approximately  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended july  these benefits resulted from the sale of the company s new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the fiscal year ended july  was  compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended july  liquidity and capital resources from our inception  our principal sources of capital have been consulting revenues  private placements and public offerings of our securities  as well as loans and capital contributions from our principal stockholders 
we have had a history of recurring losses  giving rise to an accumulated deficit at july  of  we have had negative cash flow from operating activities of   and  for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately  as compared to working capital of  as of july   representing a net increase in working capital of approximately  as explained further below  such increase is primarily attributable to a net increase in cash and short term investments  an increase in investment in marketable equity security available for sale  and a decrease in accounts payable 
in april  we successfully closed an offering of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the april private placement involved the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
we received proceeds  net of offering costs  of  in may  we successfully closed an offering of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  the may private placement 
the may private placement involved the sale of approximately  shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
we received proceeds  net of offering costs  of approximately  net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the fiscal year ended july   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  the  increase in net cash used in operating activities in the fiscal year ended july  compared with is due to the following  increase in net loss in the fiscal year ended july  due to an increase in operating expenses   non cash charge in the fiscal year ended july  to record stock compensation expense pursuant to sfas r   increase in deferred revenue in the fiscal year ended july  attributable to payments received by us from our licensees  which payments are being amortized over the remaining terms of the agreements with the licensees   increase in inventory in the fiscal year ended july  related to the purchase of raw materials for our nitroglycerin lingual spray product candidate   increase in accounts payable in the fiscal year ended july  primarily related to costs incurred in conjunction with the manufacturing and process development of our nitroglycerin lingual spray product candidate  and  non cash charge recorded in the fiscal year ended july  for restricted shares of our common stock awarded to a consultant 
in the fiscal year ended july    was used in investing activities  principally due to purchases of short term investments  net of maturities of short term investments 
in the fiscal year ended july    was provided by investing activities which related to  of maturities of short term and long term investments   of purchases of short term investments  and  of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended july  consisted primarily of leasehold improvements for our new laboratory facility and manufacturing equipment at inyx usa  ltd 
for the manufacture of our nitromist product candidate 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  in the fiscal year ended july   as compared to  in the fiscal year ended july  this increase of  is primarily due to  in net proceeds relating to the april private placement  as compared to  in net proceeds relating to the may private placement 
such increase was partially offset by  of proceeds received from the shares of our common stock issued to hana biosciences in the fiscal year ended july  until and unless our operations generate significant revenues  we will attempt to continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the sources of capital described below 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon achieving sales and positive cash flows from operating activities and or obtaining additional financing 
the most likely sources of financing include private placements of our equity or debt securities or bridge loans to us from third party lenders  license payments from existing and current and future partners  and royalty payments from sales of approved drugs by partners 
we can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs 
although we expect to have sufficient cash to fund our operations through the end of fiscal  we would have to significantly reduce the pace of our ongoing development of our priority product candidates unless we can obtain additional working capital 
given the current and desired pace of product development of our priority product candidates  we estimate that we could need to raise additional capital during fiscal year in order to fully fund our development activities through july  this could include the securing of funds through new partnerships and or the sale of our common stock or other securities  in order to fund our research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties related to our attempt to complete a financing or strategic partnering arrangement that are outside our control 
we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unsuccessful at obtaining additional financing as needed  we may be required to significantly curtail or cease operations 
we will need additional financing thereafter until we achieve profitability  if ever 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our aggregate contractual cash obligations as of july  payments due by period total year years years years capital leases operating leases employment agreements consulting agreements total contractual cash obligations we expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses from costs related to the continued development of our product candidates  clinical trials  and administrative activities
