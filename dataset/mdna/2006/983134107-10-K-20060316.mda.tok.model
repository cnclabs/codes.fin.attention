item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
we attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary 
we cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect  and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at december  on our expected long term indebtedness 
however  we cannot predict the libor or hibor rates that will be in effect in the future 
accordingly  the libor and hibor rates at december  of and  respectively are used for all calculations in the table below

wynn las vegas swaps during  we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of million of borrowings under our previous wynn las vegas  llc credit facilities 
on december   concurrent with the refinancing of wynn las vegas  llc s debt structure  we terminated these two interest rate swaps 
as a result of the termination  we received a cash payment of approximately million in settlement of the related asset 
concurrent with the refinancing  we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of million of borrowings under the current wynn las vegas  llc term loan facility  which bears interest at libor plus 
under each of these two interest rate swap arrangements  we receive payments at a variable rate of libor and pay a fixed rate of on million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from february and march  respectively through december although these interest rate swaps are highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on these borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately  changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period are  and will continue to be  recorded as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting 
wynn macau on october   we entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on future borrowings under wynn macau sa s million senior term loan facility 
under the first swap agreement  we pay a fixed interest rate of on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately million  in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable libor at the time of payment 
under the second swap agreement  we pay a fixed interest rate of on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately hk billion approximately us million  in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable hibor at the time of payment 
the term of both swap agreements is from november  through november  these interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on of the us dollar and of the hong kong dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately and  respectively 
however  changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are  and will continue to be  recognized as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting 
summary of historical fair values the following table presents the historical asset or liability fair values reflected in deposits and other assets or in other long term liabilities as appropriate at december   and and as of the december  termination date of the previous wynn las vegas interest rate swaps amounts in thousands wynn las vegas previous interest rate swaps wynn las vegas current interest rate swaps wynn macau interest rate swaps total interest rate swap asset liability asset liability fair value at december  at december  at december  settlement at december  the fair value approximates the amount the company would receive if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates 
fair value is estimated based upon current  and predictions of future  interest rate levels along a yield curve  the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions  and therefore  is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods

interest rate sensitivity for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million in interest 
certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the year was based upon a variable  libor rate plus a premium 
a increase in the libor would have increased our interest cost for by approximately foreign currency risks the currency delineated in wynn macau s concession agreement with the government of macau is the macau pataca 
the macau pataca  which is not a freely convertible currency  is linked to the hong kong dollar  and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in macau 
the hong kong dollar is linked to the us dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years 
however  the exchange linkages of the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca  and the hong kong dollar and the us dollar  are subject to potential changes due to  among other things  changes in chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments 
in july  officials from the people s bank of china announced the adoption of a new foreign exchange policy that will move away from a us dollar peg of chinese renminbi to one us dollar 
the renminbi will instead trade based on a basket of currencies 
the currency components of the basket have not been announced 
the exchange rate at september   was chinese renminbi to one us dollar 
management believes that the current revaluation of the renminibi will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
certain asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the linkage of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the hong kong dollar  and the macau pataca will continue to be linked to the us dollar  which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies 
we also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level 
because many of wynn macau s payment and expenditure obligations are in macau patacas  in the event of unfavorable macau pataca or hong kong dollar rate changes  wynn macau s obligations  as denominated in us dollars  would increase 
in addition  because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that wynn macau operates in macau will be in hong kong dollars  we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the hong kong dollar and the us dollar 
also  if any of our macau related entities incur us dollar denominated debt  fluctuations in the exchange rates of the macau pataca or the hong kong dollar  in relation to the us dollar  could have adverse effects on wynn macau s ability to service its debt  its results of operations and its financial condition 
we have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk
