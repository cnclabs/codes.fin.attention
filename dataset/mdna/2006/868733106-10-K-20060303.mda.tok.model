item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion regarding surewest telephone s revenues that are subject to the competitive environment in which surewest telephone operates 
the company anticipates that its businesses will continue to experience competition and that the nature and extent of such competition will increase 
competitors to the surewest telephone business include competitive local exchange carriers  interexchange carriers including interexchange carriers which serve customers directly without using facilities of local exchange carriers  wireless service providers including surewest wireless  providers of ip based calling services  customers which are telecommunications self providers  and a range of other providers that specialize in certain niche areas of telecommunications 
technology change has accelerated the pressure on established carriers  including surewest telephone  by virtue of software defined businesses  and innovations related to packet switching and use of the internet and ip capabilities 
regulation surewest telephone s revenues are influenced greatly by the actions of the cpuc and the fcc 
all intrastate telecommunications service rates of surewest telephone are subject to comprehensive regulation by the cpuc 
the provision of access to the networks of interexchange carriers for long distance calling is governed by access tariffs and by intercarrier agreements  which are subject to the jurisdiction of the cpuc or fcc  or both  depending upon the nature of the transmissions 
surewest telephone has a tariff on file with the fcc for all elements of interstate access services except carrier common line charges  for which surewest telephone concurs with the tariff of the national exchange carrier association neca 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone  which utilize estimated cost information and projected demand usage 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
additionally  under current fcc rules governing rate making  surewest telephone is required to establish interstate rates based on projected demand usage for its various services and determine the actual earnings from these rates once actual volumes and costs are known 
the characterization of traffic as interstate or intrastate  and as a telecommunications or information service has been a significant source of dispute among carriers and others in recent years  as those characterizations can impact the regulatory treatment of the traffic and the payment obligations of the providers which are involved 
the characterization of i traffic involved in intercarrier interconnection  ii internet traffic  and iii traffic that makes use of ip and other transmission technologies are examples of issues that are currently subject to analysis on the state and federal levels  and that are expected to be subject to regulatory action in the near future 
both the fcc and cpuc have initiated proceedings to evaluate the appropriate level of regulation for providers of telecommunications services and for ip enabled services 
in addition  various proceedings at the fcc are pending that could lead to significant alteration of the existing compensation arrangements among providers of telecommunications services  and that could adversely impact the amount of the payments received by the company from carriers and others for use of the company s network 
in  the cpuc issued a decision that authorized surewest telephone to implement a new regulatory framework nrf for services furnished within surewest telephone s service area in order to accommodate market and regulatory movement toward competition and greater pricing flexibility 
under the nrf  surewest telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements  and it was initially required to share earnings with customers through a reduction of revenues if its earned annual rate of return exceeds that authorized by the cpuc 
the company was involved in a proceeding at the cpuc that considered the continued need for certain sharing requirements in the intrastate jurisdiction and  in connection with that review  also considered the issue of whether the company overearned in the intrastate jurisdiction in recent monitoring periods and the amount of overearnings that should be shared with customers 
in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with the other parties in the proceeding  the office of ratepayer advocates ora and the utility reform network turn  to resolve all issues in the proceeding 
in november  the cpuc approved the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement resolved existing intrastate sharing obligations and related earnings issues for the monitoring periods through  put into place a surcredit mechanism for the amount of the settlement  and suspended the requirement for any intrastate sharing for monitoring periods from january  through at least december  the settlement agreement resulted in surewest telephone recognizing an increase in local revenues of  due to a change in accounting estimate in the fourth quarter of this increase in revenues resulted in a decrease of the company s net loss by  per share during in accordance with the settlement agreement  surewest telephone will return approximately  plus interest at the day commercial paper rate for non financial institutions  which was as of december   and an imputed rate of  to its end users through a consumer dividend over a period of four years  which began january  for the year ended december   approximately  was returned to the end users 
in addition  surewest telephone will pay a one time consumer dividend of  which includes an annual imputed interest rate of no stated contractual interest rate  over two years  which began january  to settle the monitoring periods to for the year ended december   approximately  was returned to the consumers and was recorded as a reduction of the company s contractual shareable earnings obligations 
at december   the aggregate contractual shareable earnings obligation for these surcredits was  which is net of an unamortized discount pertaining to imputed interest of at that date 
further  commencing january   surewest telephone will implement an annual consumer dividend of  to end users receiving surewest telephone services subject to sharing on or after that date  however  this consumer dividend is subject to reduction based upon the results of other pending regulatory proceedings 
during the fourth quarter of  the company filed an advice letter with the cpuc proposing an increase to the consumer dividends in order to return the amounts entitled under the settlement agreement 
the change in the consumer dividends resulted from the increase in interest rates during the increase was effective january  in addition to its regulatory authority with respect to surewest telephone s rates  the cpuc also has the power  among other things  to establish terms and conditions of service  to prescribe uniform systems of accounts and to regulate the mortgaging or disposition of public utility properties 
prior to  sbc had been paying surewest telephone approximately  per year for extended area service eas pursuant to a settlement transition agreement 
in november  the cpuc authorized sbc to terminate its approximate annual eas payments to surewest telephone effective november  the cpuc authorized replacement funding to surewest telephone on an interim basis using funds from the california high cost fund chcf 
the chcf is a program designed by the cpuc to establish a fair and equitable local rate structure and to reduce any disparity in the rates charged by telephone companies serving high cost areas 
the chcf is scheduled to expire january  in addition  the cpuc opened an order instituting investigation oii for the purpose of determining whether future recovery of all  none or a portion of the approximate  annual payments previously received from sbc and received currently from the chcf  should come from surewest telephone s ratepayers or other regulatory recovery mechanisms 
in august  the cpuc adopted a decision which i authorized surewest telephone to continue receiving  annually from the chcf to offset its intrastate regulated operating expenses on an interim basis  ii required surewest telephone to prepare and submit a cost proxy model which is used generally as a basis for chcf b funding based on its current cost data  including analyses of the resulting impacts on rates  on the universal lifeline telephone service ults fund  and on the chcf fund  to be filed by surewest telephone within months  and iii authorized surewest telephone to file an advice letter with the commission s telecommunications division to implement reductions to its business access line rates 
the results of this proceeding and the potential effects on surewest telephone could impact future funding levels through the chcf 
these actions of the cpuc and of the fcc  as noted above  can affect the rates charged for access and interconnection  and  as a result  the revenues derived by the company from access and related services 
surewest telephone s future operations also may be impacted by other proceedings at the fcc and cpuc  including proceedings that address interstate access and other rates and charges  the nature of interconnection between incumbent local exchange carriers and others  the collection and distribution of support payments required to assure universal access to basic telephone services  and the charges that can be assessed for new forms of service that directly or indirectly utilize carrier networks 
substantially all of the interstate long distance business was detariffed in the long distance business is recognized as being fully competitive  and there are many providers of long distance services 
the emergence from bankruptcy reorganization proceedings of some larger interexchange and competitive local exchange carriers has created new competitive pressures in the sector for both wholesale and retail providers 
because of the level of competition  regulation of this area of the telecommunications business is light or has been removed altogether 
where it exists  regulation is focused on specific public policy concerns  such as customer account slamming  rather than the rates  terms and conditions of service 
broadband general the broadband segment includes surewest broadband  surewest internet  surewest custom data services and surewest broadband residential services 
the broadband segment also includes a competitive local exchange carrier clec  which was authorized by the cpuc in to provide telecommunications services in areas outside the telephone service area of surewest telephone 
as of january   the company consolidated the operations of surewest internet and surewest custom data services into the operations of surewest broadband for financial reporting purposes  though they remain separate legal entities 
in addition  as of january   the company consolidated the operations of surewest broadband  surewest televideo and surewest televideo of roseville for financial reporting purposes  though they remain separate legal entities 
the broadband segment provides various services to residential  business and carrier customers 
the services include high speed internet service  digital video  voice  network access and toll telephone  and custom data solutions  including collocation  fixed and burstable bandwidth  managed services and network monitoring services 
most of these services were initially offered in the greater sacramento area  principally to customers residing outside of surewest telephone s service area 
however  over time  all of surewest broadband s services have been made available to customers without regard to service area boundaries and  commencing in december  surewest broadband began providing digital video and high speed internet services to customers within surewest telephone s service area 
surewest broadband owns two gigahertz local multipoint distribution system lmds licenses  which provide coverage in parts of eleven different counties in the greater sacramento area 
these licenses allow surewest broadband to expand its network within these areas by using wireless technology for extra transmission capacity backhaul 
during  surewest broadband also began using these licenses to offer a fixed wireless service to customers outside of surewest telephone s service area in parts of the cities of lincoln and rocklin  california 
during  surewest broadband further expanded its fixed wireless service by offering this service to customers in other areas in sacramento and placer counties 
in addition  surewest broadband will continue to use this wireless technology for backhaul in cost effective areas 
surewest broadband residential services possess cable television licenses or franchises in sacramento and placer counties  the cities of roseville and lincoln  california and has expanded its services to previously licensed areas of elk grove and natomas  california as well as other areas within its service area footprint 
the company is authorized to provide video programming to substantially all of the residents in the surewest telephone service area 
surewest broadband residential services procures digital transport capability from its affiliate  surewest telephone  and has developed an advanced method of delivering video services to subscribers using internet protocol  or ip video capability 
the broadband segment utilizes a digital fiber network and is subject to continual expansion and diversification in response to business growth 
the company expects that each of its segments operating in roseville and other parts of surewest telephone s service area should benefit from the company s offerings of telecommunications  cable television and internet services 
the broadband segment accounted for approximately  and of the company s operating revenues in the years  and  respectively 
as of december   the broadband segment had  customers 
competition the businesses in the broadband segment are subject to extensive competition 
competition is highly fragmented  and has grown dramatically in recent years 
except for the digital video delivery business  which requires significant capital investment to serve designated service territories  the barriers to entry are not high  and technology changes force rapid competitive adjustments 
surewest broadband competes regularly against sbc  which is the incumbent local exchange carrier in sacramento and most of its surrounding areas  and which possesses significantly greater size and scale 
the broadband segment also competes against frontier communications in southern sacramento county 
numerous clecs and others offer telecommunications and related services on a flexible and highly specialized basis in the sacramento area 
the company has found that it can be successful by constantly seeking out new sales opportunities in attractive segments of the market  by maintaining a highly reliable network that is accessible to new customers  and by focusing on the provision of excellent service to its customers 
to the extent permitted by law and regulatory requirements  the company seeks to operate its business across the broadband segment in an integrated manner  and its network as a single integrated facility 
the operating units in this segment benefit within the region from the name recognition and reputation of surewest  and from the active participation of company executives and employees in civic and other groups 
during  the company was able to obtain approval from the sacramento metropolitan cable television commission to activate service for customers in green field areas that were previously outside of the company s approved build out and activation schedules 
it now anticipates that it will achieve a competitive market share in the provision of telephone  digital video and internet services in many of these areas around sacramento 
it is important to the company that its operations in this segment be able to deliver services to customers in developing areas as they grow 
the company is also considering whether a modification or expansion of its service territory in sacramento county is appropriate 
the broadband segment has assumed the responsibility for much of the company s dsl and high speed internet retail customer base 
the emergence of cable modems  wireless internet access and other avenues to reach the internet provide significant competition 
the presence of other broadband internet access providers has begun to exert downward pressure on pricing in the region 
the market faced by the company among multichannel video providers is very competitive 
the main competitors of surewest broadband residential services are comcast and various satellite television providers 
in the company s opinion  the comcast organization possesses significant market power in sacramento county 
however  the governing sacramento county commission promotes competition in the provision of cable service  and has a straightforward franchise and licensing ordinance that accommodates other new entrants rapidly  and allows them flexibility in defining service territories 
surewest has entered the sacramento  roseville and lincoln cable service markets as the second or subsequent franchisee  and while it will  therefore  benefit from the somewhat reduced regulation that such entrants enjoy  it will nevertheless face the challenge of drawing customers away from the incumbent provider 
the provision of cable television over a closed transmission path has been recognized as possessing certain monopoly characteristics and  therefore  the ability of a second or subsequent provider to succeed in the marketplace is not assured 
similarly  the possession of comparative size and scale can give a competitor an advantage in both access to and pricing of the program content needed to operate a cable television business  and comcast possesses significantly greater size and scale in sacramento than the company 
regulation like surewest telephone  surewest broadband must comply with various rules of the cpuc governing tariffs  access to information  consumer protection and similar matters for a telecommunication service provider 
the fcc has jurisdiction over the surewest broadband interstate services  such as access service 
in  the fcc adopted rules that have caused clec interstate switched access charges to decline over time  and that have also caused a decline in the amount of compensation that can be derived from internet service provider dial up traffic 
surewest broadband is only minimally affected by these actions  and has already modified its rates to comply with the fcc requirements 
in late  the fcc began a triennial review of its policies on unbundled network elements unes and other regulations that affect the nature of competition between ilecs and clecs 
the fcc concluded its triennial review in early  and its action was appealed by a number of parties 
the appellate court reversed the fcc and vacated significant portions of the fcc rules in a decision that was released in early march  but stayed its mandate for a short time 
subsequently  the fcc released a new decision with modified rules 
that new decision also has been appealed 
surewest broadband does not rely to any significant degree on unes or other offerings that would be affected by these appeals  and it does not rely generally on the availability of discounted incremental cost pricing of service elements from the incumbent local exchange carrier to serve retail customers 
however  the position of surewest broadband in the sacramento market could be affected by a change in law or regulation that granted unrestricted pricing flexibility to the incumbent local exchange carrier in sacramento or that denies competitors the ability to assure that pricing concessions given to customers are nondiscriminatory and offered on a consistent basis 
the cable television business is governed by federal  state and local laws and regulation  but is most substantially controlled by the mechanisms in title vi of the communications act of  as amended 
while closely regulated in some areas  providers of cable services are generally free from rate regulation  and have wide leeway to select and package the content that they deliver 
in exchange for their use of local streets and rights of way  cable providers are required to pay franchise fees  and to deliver public  educational and governmental channels for use by the community  among other things 
wireless general the wireless segment consists of the company s subsidiary surewest wireless which was formed for the purpose of providing wireless personal communications services pcs 
pcs is viewed generally as involving the capability to deliver a more advanced set of features and capabilities than the basic form of cellular mobile service 
surewest wireless derives its revenue from the provision of wireless pcs  and the sale of handsets and related communications equipment 
in addition  surewest wireless generates revenue from long distance calls  roaming service  custom calling and other features 
surewest wireless has fcc licenses that allow it to offer wireless services in four basic trading areas  representing counties located in central california 
these areas include the cities of sacramento  stockton  modesto and yuba city 
each license represents megahertz of spectrum  and accommodates digital wireless technology that is capable of providing both voice and data transmission 
surewest wireless established its market share in the sacramento market in large part by promoting an unlimited flat rate regional calling plan 
wireless customer acquisition has historically been most active during the december holiday season  and the company has always been active in sales and marketing at this time 
in recent years  including  surewest wireless initiated a number of new service options for customers  including additional regional plans  an unlimited national plan  a family plan and new vertical services such as wireless data capabilities  which have attracted new customers 
evolution of the marketplace has prompted surewest wireless to open five retail stores in its service area 
surewest wireless has been seeking to expand its service penetration among major accounts during  while seeking to reduce customer turnover churn and to increase revenues from its customer base 
the wireless business requires capital investment to build new cell sites and to deploy digital and other advanced service capabilities 
in  capital investment in surewest wireless will emphasize continued improvements in service levels rather than network expansion 
as of december   surewest wireless had  subscribers 
the wireless segment accounted for approximately  and of the company s operating revenue in the years  and  respectively 
competition the market for wireless services is highly competitive 
there are numerous facilities based wireless providers in the sacramento market  including all of the major national providers  and additional wireless resellers 
most of these competitors have a national presence and  therefore  have the ability to leverage national advertising budgets and name recognition 
in addition  many of the competitors have access to additional spectrum in the geographic markets in which surewest wireless competes 
in order for surewest wireless to succeed in this geographic market  it must establish innovative services  such as its unlimited flat rate service package  and continue to leverage the surewest name and reputation 
a trend toward consolidation in this segment has begun to emerge  with the announcement of merger agreements involving some of the largest wireless providers 
competition in this segment is expected to remain intense 
effective in  the fcc mandated that wireless carriers provide for local number portability lnp 
lnp allows subscribers to keep their wireless phone numbers while switching to a different service provider 
although the company has experienced favorable porting activity  the implementation of lnp has not had a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
regulation because of their use of valuable spectrum resources  wireless services are subject to regulation 
the construction  operation  management and transfer of digital wireless systems in the united states are regulated by the fcc and cpuc 
however  regulators do not interfere with price plans offered to wireless customers 
other significant events sale of pay telephone assets in july  the company sold its pay telephone assets for to a nationwide provider of private pay telephone services 
during the quarter ended june   the company incurred a pretax asset impairment charge of  which was recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations as depreciation and amortization expense 
the asset impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the pay telephone assets within the telecom segment to its fair value of  which represented the expected proceeds from the sale of assets 
worldcom bankruptcy settlement certain of the company s customers filed for bankruptcy protection in  the most notable of which was worldcom  inc worldcom  which  together with its affiliates collectively mci  filed for bankruptcy protection in july in april  mci emerged from federal bankruptcy protection

item a 
risk factors 
as a result of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not necessarily be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
representative examples of these factors include without limitation the following we expect to continue to face significant competition in all parts of our business and the level of competition is expected to intensify 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
we face actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies  including other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies  long distance carriers and resellers  wireless telephone companies  internet service providers  satellite companies and cable television companies 
we may not be able to successfully anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including regulatory changes that may affect our competitors and us differently  new technologies and services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends and discount pricing strategies by competitors 
as the incumbent carrier in sacramento  sbc communications enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  favorable regulatory position  brand recognition and connection to virtually all of our customers and potential customers there 
as the largest cable operator in sacramento and placer county  comcast enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  ownership or superior access to programming and other content  brand recognition  and first in the field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations 
we face intense competition in our markets for long distance  internet access and other ancillary services that are important to our business and to our growth strategy 
we must adapt to rapid technological change 
technological developments could increase our costs and cause a decline in demand for our services 
in addition  technology changes can reduce the costs of entry for others and give competitors significant new advantages 
if we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment that becomes obsolete  we will be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers  and we may be placed at a cost disadvantage in offering our services 
additionally  replacing or upgrading our infrastructure in the future could result in significant capital expenditures 
we are subject to a complex and uncertain regulatory environment 
some parts of our business are extensively regulated  and the nature of regulation continues to undergo fundamental change and reinterpretation 
many businesses that compete with the company are comparatively less regulated 
many significant regulatory decisions have had to be accommodated in recent years  and there are pending decisions on issues affecting the company that are of great importance 
our operations have undergone material changes  and our actual operating results can be expected to differ from the results indicated in our historical financial statements 
as a result of our acquisition of assets  which launched our residential broadband business  and the subsequent expansion of our cable television business  our mix of operating assets differs from those operations upon which our historical financial statements are based 
consequently  our historical financial statements may not be reliable as an indicator of future results 
our success depends upon our ability to manage our growth and expansion 
if our recent acquisitions and growth initiatives are not successful  we could suffer an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our growth strategy will continue to require us to invest significant capital in facilities and services that may not achieve the desired returns 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to manage our growth  including our ability to build network and related facilities to serve new customers  integrate our operations to take advantage of new capabilities and systems  attract and retain skilled personnel across the company  effectively manage the demands of day to day operations in new areas while attempting to execute our business strategy  and realize the projected growth and revenue targets developed by company management 
we receive support from various funds established under federal and state law and the continued receipt of that support is not assured 
while we do not receive any support from the rural or non rural federal universal service high cost loop fund  we do receive payments from various other federal or state programs 
these include interstate common line support  california high cost fund b chcf and the lifeline  education and libraries programs 
these governmental programs are reviewed and amended from time to time  and are likely to change in the near future 
as described in the telecom regulation section above  the company currently receives funding of  annually from the chcf  a program designed by the california public utilities commission cpuc to establish a fair and equitable local rate structure and to reduce any disparity in the rates charged by certain telephone companies serving high cost areas 
the amount of this support from the chcf is the subject of pending regulatory proceedings  and its continuation is dependent upon many factors 
in addition  the state legislative authorization for the chcf is scheduled to expire january  the outcome and impact on the company s operations resulting from future changes to these governmental programs cannot be determined at this time 
we could be harmed by the recent developments affecting other communications companies 
there have been numerous bankruptcies and other financial difficulties experienced by other carriers and suppliers in the telecommunications and internet sectors 
similar situations with our suppliers  some of whom provide products and services for which there are few substitutes  could cause us to experience delays  service interruptions or additional expenses 
situations with carrier and other customers could affect our ability to collect services that have been provided 
we depend on third parties  over whom we have no control  to deliver our services 
because of the interconnected nature of the telecommunications industry  we depend heavily on other local telephone companies  long distance carriers  and numerous other third parties to deliver our services 
in addition  we are dependent on easements  franchises and licenses from various private parties such as established telephone companies and other utilities  railroads  long distance companies  and from state highway authorities  local governments and transit authorities for access to aerial pole space  underground conduits and other rights of way in order to construct and operate our networks 
the failure to maintain in effect the necessary third party arrangements on acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
we are subject to corporate governance and internal control reporting requirements  and our failure to comply with existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section and related securities and exchange commission rules  we have issued a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls at december  in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm audited and reported on management s assessment 
management concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december  if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls or if future deficiencies are not adequately addressed  we could experience accounting errors that could result in misstatements of our financial position and results of operations  potential restatements of our financial statements or otherwise adversely affect our business  reputation and results of operations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities

item legal proceedings 
dollars in thousands except for the proceedings described below  the company is not aware of any material pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business  to which it is a party or to which any of its property is subject 
prior to january   surewest telephone billed sbc communications sbc various charges for certain local service and network access service revenues in accordance with certain agreements as described below 
in  sbc expressed interest in withdrawing from the designated carrier plan dcp for surewest telephone s toll traffic 
the dcp was a compensation arrangement between surewest telephone and sbc for certain intrastate toll services

the calculations supporting these liabilities are very complex and involve a variety of estimates prior to the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
in addition  surewest telephone s interstate shareable earnings obligations lapse over time if surewest telephone s interexchange carrier and other customers do not claim the amounts ascribed to them 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of the company s liabilities for interstate shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material

the company s forecast indicates it is likely that the company will continue to borrow funds during the next twelve months to fund operations and planned capital expenditures  including capital expenditures as required by the company s cable franchise agreements  while maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents 
such borrowing might be undertaken under the  bank credit facility or by the incurrence of additional long term indebtedness  or a combination of short and long term borrowing 
the company believes  given its financial position and debt to equity position  it has substantial additional short and long term borrowing capacity 
as indicated above  a substantial portion of the company s budgeted capital expenditures and cash dividend payments is at the discretion of the company

the company s payments to such entity approximated in critical accounting policies and estimates below is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates  which are more fully described in the referenced notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
as discussed more fully in note  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and wireless licenses are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
the impairment test for goodwill requires the company to estimate the fair value at the reporting unit level 
to determine the fair value in  the company obtained an independent valuation of the company s goodwill using a discounted cash flow model 
assumptions used in this model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  a weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital  and no terminal growth rate 
the carrying value of the company s goodwill was  as of december  when determining the fair value  the use of different estimates or assumptions within the discounted cash flow model when determining fair value of the company s goodwill could result in a different fair value 
for example  the company used a discount rate of and no terminal growth rate in its assessment of fair value in if the discount rate were to increase  the fair value of the goodwill would decrease by  but would not result in an impairment of goodwill 
the company s wireless licenses include personal communications services pcs and local multipoint distribution service lmds licenses 
the carrying value at december  of the pcs and lmds licenses was  and  respectively 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s pcs licenses  the company obtained an independent valuation in  which reviewed transactions involving sales of comparable wireless licenses in the aftermarket  using characteristics of the license and the related market  including geographic location  market size  megahertz frequency and population density 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s lmds licenses  the company obtained an independent valuation  as comparable license sales data was not available 
the independent valuation estimates fair value of the company s lmds licenses using a discounted cash flow model 
assumptions used in this model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  a weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital adjusted to reflect the inherent risks associated with the introduction of a new service offering  and a terminal value growth rate 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within the discounted cash flow model when determining fair value of the company s lmds licenses could result in different values for these licenses 
for example  the company used a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of in its assessment of fair value in if the discount rate were to increase  the fair value of the lmds licenses would decrease by  which would result in an impairment charge of approximately based on the carrying value of the lmds licenses as of december  in addition  the company s lmds licenses may be impaired in the near future if the estimates and assumptions used in the lmds license discounted cash flow model are not met 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  then the carrying value is written down to the fair value 
as a result of the company s annual test for  no impairment of either goodwill or pcs or lmds licenses was indicated 
during  the company was unaware of any events or changes in circumstance that would require a test of impairment that may potentially reduce the fair value below the carrying value 
as discussed more fully in note  total revenues from telephone services are affected by rates authorized by various regulatory agencies 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
based on these rules  the company is required to prospectively set its annual interstate rates based on the aforementioned cost separation studies 
these cost studies include estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data including operating expenses  taxes and investment in property  plant and equipment 
non financial data estimates are also utilized in the preparation of these cost studies  including projected demand usage and detailed network information 
the company must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction 
these estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies 
the company also participates in the neca pool for certain interstate revenues 
in addition to the estimates noted above  the company s earned rate of return from its participation in the neca pool can also be impacted by the earnings and data of other carriers who participate in the pool 
in accordance with the nrf  surewest telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements by the cpuc  and it was initially required to share earnings with customers based on its earned annual rate of return 
the company utilizes models  which rely on estimates regarding the jurisdictional separation of financial data and operational data into the interstate jurisdictions as discussed previously for the purposes of calculating its earned annual rate of return 
however  as discussed more fully in note  surewest telephone has entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the cpuc in november  to cease intrastate sharing requirements beginning january  through at least december  the settlement agreement also resolves existing sharing obligations and related earnings issues for the monitoring periods as a result of these estimates and assumptions  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of surewest telephone s shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material 
for example  the cpuc approved a settlement agreement on november  that resolved the company s intrastate shareable earnings for the years through in accordance with this settlement agreement  the company recorded  in local revenues due to a change in accounting estimate in the fourth quarter of this increase in revenue resulted in a decrease of the company s net loss by  per share 
see note for a more detailed discussion regarding the settlement agreement 
as discussed more fully in note  the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement between the company and the customer exists  ii delivery of the product to the customer has occurred or service has been provided to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
as discussed more fully in note  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of its customers to make required payments 
in evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable  the company assesses a number of factors including a specific customer s or carrier s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical and future expectations of conditions that may impact the company s ability to collect its accounts receivable 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the company s past collection experience is no longer relevant  the company s estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
if uncollectibility of the company s billed revenue changes by  the company would expect an increase in uncollectible expense of approximately  as of december   the company had three customers that accounted for of consolidated accounts receivable 
although management believes that these customers are creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material effect on their ability to pay timely and  therefore  on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  certain revenues are subject to refund if the customer terminates services or returns equipment within a stipulated time period  or if certain performance criteria are not met 
accordingly  the company maintains accounts receivable allowances and recognizes certain customer refund liabilities  through charges to revenues  based on the company s best estimates of the resolution of these contingencies  which are based on historical experience 
as discussed more fully in note  the company states its inventories held for sale at lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  the company is required to make estimates regarding future customer demand and technological advances of equipment 
as discussed more fully in note  property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
retirements and other reductions of regulated telephone plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized in accordance with the composite group remaining life methodology utilized for telephone plant assets 
when property applicable to non telephone operations is sold or retired  the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the associated gain or loss is recognized 
property  plant and equipment is depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives 
the economic lives are estimated at the time the assets are acquired and are based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or differently than anticipated  the economic lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than anticipated  the life of the asset group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
the company reviews the estimated useful lives of its property  plant and equipment once every three years  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s property  plant and equipment  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
as discussed in note  the company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional retirement obligations  which requires the company to recognize a retirement obligation when a legal obligation exists to remove an asset at some point in the future or if legislation exists that requires special disposal procedures of the asset 
the company believes it may have potential retirement obligations relating to its wireless cell sites and disposal obligations relating to certain building materials containing asbestos 
based on terms outlined in its tower leases  the company is obligated to return the land or facilities to their original condition at the end of the cell site lease term  should the lease be terminated 
based on the company s estimates it believes that the disposal requirement relating to certain building materials containing asbestos is the expected retirement date of the underlying assets 
the company has used a probability weighted cash flow approach in estimating its potential retirement obligations 
the company calculates the net present value of the retirement obligation assuming an inflation rate of  a discount rate of and a market risk premium of 
the company has also assumed the settlement date for its wireless towers to be years from the date the asset is placed into service 
the company has estimated that the expected retirement date of its buildings that contain asbestos is the company has also used a probability weighted assessment to address the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash flows to settle the potential liability 
the company believes that utilizing probabilities for its wireless towers of less than is appropriate because the company believes the likelihood of incurring material asset retirement expenditures is remote 
the company used a probability factor of its building materials containing asbestos 
the company monitors the estimates and assumptions used in determining its potential asset retirement obligations for its cell sites and buildings containing asbestos 
however  the company believes it is remote that any future adjustment to its asset retirement liability for obligations existing as of december  will be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as discussed more fully in notes and  the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company does not have a valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset as of december  or because it believes it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset will be realized 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination was made 
as discussed more fully in note  the company has pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
the company s pension and post retirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined based on estimates of discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and increases in future compensation levels 
changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact the company s pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects percentage point increase percentage point decrease effect on total post retirement service and interest cost effect on post retirement benefit obligation as of december  for  the discount rate used for the company s pension and post retirement benefit obligations was and  respectively 
the discount rates were determined based on current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
the rate used for the post retirement benefit obligation reflects heavier weighting for retired participants of shorter durations 
the expected return on assets eroa rate is determined based on the current and projected investment portfolio mix and estimated long term investment returns for each asset class 
in  the company used an eroa of 
the company evaluated the appropriateness of the eroa rate for by analyzing the long term returns for domestic and international equities  as well as domestic fixed income instruments 
based on the evaluation the company decreased the eroa for to to better reflect the current economic environment 
the decrease in the eroa rate will increase the company s pension expense approximately  or 
the future compensation levels are based on recent experience as well as future expectations 
as of december  and during  the company expects its future compensation level to remain consistent at  which is consistent with the prior year 
as discussed more fully in notes and  the company is a party to a variety of litigation  regulatory proceedings and other contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses for certain of these matters 
the determination of the liabilities required  if any  for loss contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate outcome of these matters will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
as discussed more fully in note  the company currently sponsors two equity incentive plans the plans for certain employees  outside directors and consultants of the company  which were approved by the company s shareholders 
the plans permit issuance by the company of awards in the form of restricted shares  stock units  performance shares  stock options and stock appreciation rights 
effective january   the company adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the prospective transition method selected by the company  as described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  compensation expense was recognized beginning in for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after january  this change in accounting for stock based compensation resulted in increased compensation expense of and and decreased net income by no effect on earnings per share and no effect on earnings per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   compensation expensed increased  which increased net loss by no effect on earnings per share 
the company voluntarily made the choice to change to the preferable method of accounting for employee stock options in accordance with sfas no 
the company concluded that stock options are a form of employee compensation expense and  therefore  it is appropriate that these expenses be recorded in the results of operations to more clearly reflect economic reality 
the black scholes merton option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect management s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
if management uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years

r at the beginning of their next fiscal year instead of their next reporting period beginning after june  the effective date of the new standard for the company s consolidated financial statements is january  beginning with the reporting period ending march  
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
under the prospective method of adoption selected by the company under the provisions of sfas no

compensation cost of previously granted awards that were not recognized under sfas no 
will be recognized under sfas no 
r 
had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
the company has chosen to use the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin no 
clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin no 
requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the company s adoption of fin no 
on december  did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that could affect future results as a result of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not necessarily be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
representative examples of these factors include without limitation the following we expect to continue to face significant competition in all parts of our business and the level of competition is expected to intensify 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
we face actual or potential competition from many existing and emerging companies  including other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies  long distance carriers and resellers  wireless telephone companies  internet service providers  satellite companies and cable television companies 
we may not be able to successfully anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including regulatory changes that may affect our competitors and us differently  new technologies and services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends and discount pricing strategies by competitors 
as the incumbent carrier in sacramento  sbc communications enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  favorable regulatory position  brand recognition and connection to virtually all of our customers and potential customers there 
as the largest cable operator in sacramento and placer county  comcast enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  ownership or superior access to programming and other content  brand recognition  and first in the field advantages with a customer base that generates positive cash flow for its operations 
we face intense competition in our markets for long distance  internet access and other ancillary services that are important to our business and to our growth strategy 
we must adapt to rapid technological change 
technological developments could increase our costs and cause a decline in demand for our services 
in addition  technology changes can reduce the costs of entry for others and give competitors significant new advantages 
if we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment that becomes obsolete  we will be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers  and we may be placed at a cost disadvantage in offering our services 
additionally  replacing or upgrading our infrastructure in the future could result in significant capital expenditures 
we are subject to a complex and uncertain regulatory environment 
some parts of our business are extensively regulated  and the nature of regulation continues to undergo fundamental change and reinterpretation 
many businesses that compete with the company are comparatively less regulated 
many significant regulatory decisions have had to be accommodated in recent years  and there are pending decisions on issues affecting the company that are of great importance 
our operations have undergone material changes  and our actual operating results can be expected to differ from the results indicated in our historical financial statements 
as a result of our acquisition of assets  which launched our residential broadband business  and the subsequent expansion of our cable television business  our mix of operating assets differs from those operations upon which our historical financial statements are based 
consequently  our historical financial statements may not be reliable as an indicator of future results 
our success depends upon our ability to manage our growth and expansion 
if our recent acquisitions and growth initiatives are not successful  we could suffer an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our growth strategy will continue to require us to invest significant capital in facilities and services that may not achieve the desired returns 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to manage our growth  including our ability to build network and related facilities to serve new customers  integrate our operations to take advantage of new capabilities and systems  attract and retain skilled personnel across the company  effectively manage the demands of day to day operations in new areas while attempting to execute our business strategy  and realize the projected growth and revenue targets developed by company management 
we receive support from various funds established under federal and state law and the continued receipt of that support is not assured 
while we do not receive any support from the rural or non rural federal universal service high cost loop fund  we do receive payments from various other federal or state programs 
these include interstate common line support  chcf and the lifeline  education and libraries programs 
these governmental programs are reviewed and amended from time to time  and are likely to change in the near future 
as described in the regulation section above  the company currently receives funding of  annually from the chcf  a program designed by the cpuc to establish a fair and equitable local rate structure and to reduce any disparity in the rates charged by certain telephone companies serving high cost areas 
the amount of this support from the chcf is the subject of pending regulatory proceedings  and its continuation is dependent upon many factors 
in addition  the state legislative authorization for the chcf is scheduled to expire january  the outcome and impact on the company s operations resulting from future changes to these governmental programs cannot be determined at this time 
we could be harmed by the recent developments affecting other communications companies 
there have been numerous bankruptcies and other financial difficulties experienced by other carriers and suppliers in the telecommunications and internet sectors 
similar situations with our suppliers  some of whom provide products and services for which there are few substitutes  could cause us to experience delays  service interruptions or additional expenses 
situations with carrier and other customers could affect our ability to collect services that have been provided 
we depend on third parties  over whom we have no control  to deliver our services 
because of the interconnected nature of the telecommunications industry  we depend heavily on other local telephone companies  long distance carriers  and numerous other third parties to deliver our services 
in addition  we are dependent on easements  franchises and licenses from various private parties such as established telephone companies and other utilities  railroads  long distance companies  and from state highway authorities  local governments and transit authorities for access to aerial pole space  underground conduits and other rights of way in order to construct and operate our networks 
the failure to maintain in effect the necessary third party arrangements on acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
we are subject to corporate governance and internal control reporting requirements  and our failure to comply with existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section and related securities and exchange commission rules  we have issued a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls at december  in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm audited and reported on management s assessment 
management concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective at december  if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls or if future deficiencies are not adequately addressed  we could experience accounting errors that could result in misstatements of our financial position and results of operations  potential restatements of our financial statements or otherwise adversely affect our business  reputation and results of operations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
regulatory and legal matters surewest telephone is subject to regulation by the fcc and cpuc 
in the past  there have been various proceedings before these agencies to which surewest telephone has been a party 
in  congress passed the telecommunications act of the act  which significantly changed the regulatory environment for telecommunications companies 
beginning in  the fcc conducted proceedings and adopted orders implementing the act s provisions to open local exchange service markets  such as the market of surewest telephone  to competition 
these proceedings and orders address interconnection  intercarrier compensation  access charges  universal service and internet protocol ip enabled service 
with respect to local competition  the fcc rules outline pricing methodologies for the states to follow when setting rates for incumbent carriers such as surewest telephone to charge competitors for resale  interconnection and unbundled network elements 
due to the ongoing actions taken by the fcc to promulgate rules and regulations on interconnection access charges and universal service reform  and the various on going legal challenges considering the validity of these fcc orders  it is not yet possible to determine fully the impact of the act and related fcc regulations on surewest telephone s operations 
the company s financial condition and results of operations have been and will be affected by recent and future proceedings before the cpuc and fcc 
pending before the fcc and cpuc are proceedings  which are considering additional rules governing the opening of markets to competition and the regulation of the competing telecommunications providers  the nature and extent of the compensation  if any  to be paid by carriers and other providers to one another for network use  and the sums to be recovered through end users and other sources  the goals and definition of universal telephone service in a changing environment  including examination of subsidy support mechanisms for subscribers of different carriers including incumbent carriers and in various geographic areas  rules that will provide non discriminatory access by competing service providers to the network capabilities of local exchange carriers  and the regulated rates and earnings of surewest telephone 
the company has been involved in a proceeding at the cpuc that has considered the continued need for certain sharing requirements in the intrastate jurisdiction  and in connection with that review  has also considered the issues of whether the company overearned in the intrastate jurisdiction in recent monitoring periods  and if so  the amount of such overearnings that should be shared with customers 
in july  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the other parties in the proceeding  the ora and turn  to resolve all issues in the proceeding 
in november  the cpuc approved the settlement agreement 
among other things  the settlement agreement resolves all earnings issues for the monitoring periods  put into place a surcredit mechanism for the amount of the settlement  and suspends the requirement for any intrastate sharing for later monitoring periods from january  through at least december  there are a number of pending and anticipated other regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on surewest telephone 
these regulatory proceedings include  but are not limited to  consideration of changes to the interstate universal service fund  intercarrier compensation  reform and the regulation of local exchange carriers and their competitors  and regulation of ip enabled services 
the outcomes and impact on surewest telephone s operations of these proceedings and related court matters cannot be determined at this time 
the eventual impact on the company of the effect of all the proceedings described above cannot presently be determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has limited exposure to the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company uses a combination of variable short term and fixed rate long term financial instruments 
in addition  the company has a contractual obligation related to its intrastate shareable earnings in the form of a surcredit to its customers over a period of four years beginning january   which is subject to variable interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio or for any other purposes 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to fund operations and planned capital expenditures 
the company currently has no cash flow exposure related to its long term debt obligations as all obligations are at fixed rates 
as of december   the company had fixed rate debt obligations of million with an average interest rate of 
based on borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities  the estimated fair value of long term debt as of december  was million 
the company currently has minimal cash flow exposure related to its short term debt obligation as the credit facility can be converted into a long term obligation at a fixed rate at anytime 
the company also believes there is limited exposure to market risk for change in interest rates related to contractual shareable earnings obligations 
the interest rate on the contractual shareable earnings obligations is variable based on a day commercial paper rate 
assuming a fluctuation of basis points in the interest rate of the contractual shareable earnings obligations  the fair value would increase thousand or decrease thousand 
as of december   the company had variable rate debt obligations of million with an average interest rate of
