we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
overview of the results of operations to aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful 
significant events business acquisitions we completed a total of six acquisitions in the three years ended december  the main purposes of these acquisitions were to expand our product portfolio and customer base 
the results of the following acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates 
the following is a summary of our acquisitions year ended december  funk software  inc funk acquired on december  developed and sold products designed to protect the integrity of the network by verifying users and devices that meet an organization s security policies before granting network access 
acorn packet solutions  inc acorn acquired on october  developed and sold products that enable migration from circuit based networks to more flexible and cost effective ip networks 
peribit networks  inc peribit acquired on july  developed and sold products that enhance wide area network wan optimization and application delivery 
redline networks  inc redline acquired on may  developed and sold application front end platforms for enterprise data centers and public web sites 
kagoor networks  inc kagoor acquired on may  developed and sold session border control products to enhance voice over internet protocol networking for communication carriers 

table of contents year ended december  netscreen technologies  inc netscreen acquired on april  developed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises  carriers  and government entities 
acquisition related liabilities in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded liabilities associated with severance  future lease  and other obligations 
the initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions and did not impact the statements of operations 
the following is a summary of these liabilities in  we recorded liabilities of million for the five acquisitions of that year  primarily related to future lease  severance  and other contractual obligations 
as of december   there was million remaining to be paid primarily related to future lease  severance  and other contractual obligations 
at the time of the netscreen acquisition in  we accrued million primarily related to professional services  severance and facility charges 
there is approximately million remaining to be paid  primarily for facility leases that extend through at the time of the acquisition of unisphere networks  inc unisphere in  we accrued million primarily related to professional services  severance and facility charges 
there is approximately million remaining to be paid  primarily for facility leases that extend through march segments as a result of these six acquisitions  we now offer two categories of products as well as services organized into the following three operating segments infrastructure products consist of the original juniper networks router portfolio and acorn products 
service layer technologies slt products include the funk  peribit  redline  kagoor  and netscreen products 
service delivers world wide services to customers of the infrastructure and slt segments 
acceleration of unvested and out of the money employee stock options on december   our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to or greater than  all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that were outstanding on december  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock or of our total outstanding unvested options on december  were accelerated 
the options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees  including all of our executive officers and our directors 
in addition  the acceleration of the unvested and out of the money options was accompanied by restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options 
those restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date  whether or not the optionee is actually an employee at that time 
the purpose of the acceleration was to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in our statements of operations pursuant to financial accounting standards board statement no 
r sfas r 
under sfas r  we will apply the expense recognition provisions relating to stock options beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in approving the acceleration  our board considered its impact on future financial results  stockholder value and employee retention 
we believe that the acceleration of the unvested and out of the money options was in the best interest of stockholders as it will reduce our reported compensation expense in future periods in light of these accounting regulations 
as a result of the acceleration  we expect to reduce the pre tax stock option expense we otherwise would have been required to record by approximately million subsequent to the adoption of sfas r beginning in the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our results of operations in 
table of contents the rules regarding option expensing are relatively recent 
it is possible that changes to existing rules  adoption of new rules or the promulgation of rulings or interpretations by the securities and exchange commission or other bodies  could cause the ultimate accounting treatment of our options to vary from our current expectations  and if applied to periods prior to such changes or rulings  could result in changes to historically reported financial information 
restructuring and other related charges restructuring reserves we initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities  focus on strategic product and customer bases  reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions 
the following is a summary of our restructuring plans charged to operating expenses in the statements of operations in  we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the acquisition of netscreen 
we initially recorded a charge of approximately million primarily related to workforce reduction costs  which has been completely paid out as of december  in  we implemented a restructuring plan  under which we announced that we would no longer develop our g series cmts products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs  non inventory asset impairment  costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs 
we initially recorded a charge of approximately million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs  non inventory asset impairment  vacating facilities costs  the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs 
as of december   approximately million remained unpaid primarily for a facility lease that extends through july in  we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the unisphere acquisition 
we initially recorded a charge of million  of which approximately million remained unpaid as of december   primarily for facility leases that extend through april during and  we adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the real estate markets changed 
see note in item for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remained to be paid 
impairment charges we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment charge to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows 
in december  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to certain kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with kagoor products 
debt retirement through december   we paid a total of million to retire all of our remaining convertible subordinated notes due march  subordinated notes 
these transactions affected our cash and cash equivalents  investments  interest income and interest expense 
tax repatriation we repatriated million under the american jobs creation act jobs act in we recorded a net tax benefit in of million related to this repatriation dividend 
the net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax 
table of contents provision  net of federal benefit  of million  offset by a tax benefit of million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings 
nature of expenses we have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales 
we have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during and most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers  accordingly  most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs 
the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs and standards that we establish 
controls around manufacturing  engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and westford  massachusetts 
our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in canada  china  malaysia  and the united states 
we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 
the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts  we may be  and have been in the past  liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  vacation  benefits and travel 
we added over and employees in and  respectively  across all functions as a result of acquisitions 
we had   and  employees as of december    and  respectively 
facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount 
these departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support our growth 
we expect these costs to stabilize in research and development expenses include the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products  outside services for such services as certifications of new products  and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment  the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we plan to increase our investment in research and development during compared to to further advance our competitive advantage 
sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services  demonstration equipment and advertisements 
these costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues  product launches and marketing initiatives 
we plan to further develop our distribution channel in in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets  serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking products 
general and administrative expenses include professional fees  bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses 
professional fees include legal  audit  tax  accounting and certain corporate strategic services 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical 
table of contents experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and  in certain instances  sales contracts or agreements 
shipping terms and related documents  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery or performance 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history to us 
on arrangements where products and services are bundled  we determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting 
we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method  as circumstances dictate 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 
for sales to direct end users and value added resellers  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller 
for our end users and value added resellers  there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors 
we recognize revenue from service contracts as services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as rebates and price protection  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
contract manufacturer liabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products  which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
we establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers  such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures  which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
warranty reserve 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product 
table of contents quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of november or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as the market approach to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductions related to stock options are not considered realizable prior to their utilization on tax returns  at which point a current tax savings results and equity is credited for such savings 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
litigation and settlement costs 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters  however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional expenses 

table of contents loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
results of operations the increases in revenues  cost of expenses  and operating expenses in compared to are attributable to  to a certain extent  the inclusion of the results of operations from funk  acorn  peribit  redline  and kagoor for part of  and netscreen for the full year in revenues  cost of revenues  and operating expenses were significantly greater during compared to due to the netscreen acquisition 
net revenues the following table shows net revenues and net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in millions  except percentages year ended december  product net revenues service net revenues total net revenues our total net revenues increased to  million in and represents a growth of from our total net revenues increased to  million in and represents a growth of from product net revenues the million or increase in our net product revenue from to was primarily a result of the adoption and expansion of ip networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network and as a result of the expansion of our product portfolio through acquisitions and internal development 
during  we recognized million of product revenue from product shipments made to end users and value added resellers that were deferred as of december  infrastructure products accounted for  million or of our total product net revenues during infrastructure product net revenue grew by from to  primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises 
slt products accounted for million or of our total product net revenues during our slt product revenue was primarily driven by the increased demand by the enterprise market 
our higher net revenues in as compared to primarily due to the revenue growth from security products 
additionally  the acquisitions made in enabled us to cross sell infrastructure  security  and application acceleration products to existing customer bases 
an analysis of the change in revenue by infrastructure and slt segments  and the change in units  can be found below in the section titled segment information 
net product revenue increased from to primarily as a result of the increase in infrastructure product shipments to meet the customers capital expenditures demands  and to a lesser extent  due to slt net revenue related to the netscreen acquisition 
service net revenues net service revenues increased million or from to primarily due to the growth in support services and  to a lesser degree  the growth in professional services 
the growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base 
we recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation 
a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for one year renewable periods 

table of contents net service revenues increased from to primarily as a result of the increase in installed base of customers and products 
total net revenues the following table shows net revenue by geographic region in millions  except percentages year ended december  americas united states other total americas europe  middle east  and africa emea asia pacific japan other total asia pacific total we continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters  and we expect this trend to continue 
net revenue in the united states as a percentage of total net revenue increased in compared to primarily due to the growth driven by increased demand within the service provider and enterprise markets 
net revenue in emea as a percentage of total net revenue increased in compared to primarily due to strength across the region  including finland  greece  italy  poland  and the united kingdom 
net revenue in japan as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in compared to primarily due to completion by customers of several network expansion projects and a pause in the build out of their next generation network  or ngn 
net revenue in other asia pacific countries as a percentage of total net revenue remained fairly consistent with prior years 
in  net revenue in the americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenue due to the improvement in customer spending in the united states 
siemens accounted for greater than of our net product and service revenues for the years ended december    and ericsson accounted for greater than of our net revenues for the year ended december  we expect that our largest customers  as well as key strategic partners  will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin gm percentages in millions  except percentages year ended december  gm gm gm cost of product revenues cost of service revenues total cost of revenues reclassifications have been made to product costs in and to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation 
the two percentage points decrease in product gross margins from to was primarily due to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product cycles 
as we have expanded our market share and entered more markets since  we have begun to experience increased price competition 
this price competition has been limited to date  as evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars compared to the year ago period as well as relatively comparable product gross margins from year to year 
we expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future 
nevertheless  higher product revenue volume contributed to the increased gross margin by million  or in when compared to 
table of contents the six percentage points increase in product gross margins from to was primarily due to cost cutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods 
in addition  the standard margins on the original netscreen products are more favorable than the standard margins on the infrastructure products and netscreen s acquisition in contributed to the increases compared to prior year 
the improvement in gross margins was also a result of a million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from to as our historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers decreased 
the increase in gross margins was partially offset by acquisition charges related to the netscreen acquisition  which increased cost of product revenues by million  for an inventory fair value adjustment and the amortization of the order backlog intangible asset 
service gross margins increased five percentage points from to and was primarily attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in headcount  outside services  and spares purchases  all of which were needed to support the growing installed base 
total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for decreased to compared to for nevertheless  in absolute dollars  total service related costs increased in compared to employee related expenses increased million  and outside service expenses increased by million as a result of increased headcount during in addition  expense associated with spares increased by million 
service gross margins increased two percentage points from to as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base  and thus a more leveraged service organization 
this increased leverage was evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue for and for  however  in absolute dollars  employee related expenses increased million from to the increases in absolute dollars were due to the netscreen acquisition 
in addition  in absolute dollars  outside services costs increased million from to  primarily due to the netscreen acquisition 
finally  the costs associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from to and remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars 
research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses amounts and as a percentage of total net revenues in millions  except percentages year ended december  research and development sales and marketing general and administrative reclassifications were made to the and amounts to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation 
research and development expenses increased million in compared to  but decreased as a percent of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of million  facility related expenses of million  engineering and testing expenses of million  equipment related expenses of million  and depreciation of million 
the increases in personnel related expenses in were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization  including those from the five acquisitions 
the increase is partially offset by the decrease in stock compensation expense of million compared to as a result of forfeitures of unvested options in we continue to invest in both stand alone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs 
in addition  we invested and expanded on our global research and development efforts  specifically in china and india 
research and development expenses increased million in compared to  but decreased as a percent of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing million year over year as a result of the netscreen acquisition 
the increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a million increase in prototype expense 
the increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from the netscreen acquisition 
prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public  and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing

marketing related expenses increased million due to the netscreen acquisition  the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution channel and channel sales 
outside services increased million due to professional services related to marketing activities 
in addition  demonstration equipment increased million due to the netscreen acquisition and the related purchase of security demonstration products for our direct sales force and resellers 
demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches 
stock compensation expense increased by million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the netscreen acquisition 
general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to and remained at of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of million and a million patent related expense 
the million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a third party to avoid future disputes

other operating expenses the following table shows other operating expenses in millions year ended december  amortization of purchased intangible assets in process research and development restructuring  impairments  and special charges  net integration costs amortization of purchased intangibles the amortization expense of intangible assets increased million in compared to primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in in addition  we recognized less than a full year of amortization expense for the intangible assets associated with the netscreen acquisition in the amortization expense of intangible assets increased million in compared to due to the intangible assets purchased in the netscreen acquisition 
see note in item for more information on our purchased intangible assets 

table of contents in process research and development in  a total of million was charged to ipr d expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year 
of the total funk purchase price  million was allocated to in process research and development ipr d 
of the total peribit purchase price  million was allocated to ipr d 
of the total kagoor purchase price  million was allocated to ipr d 
none of the acorn or redline purchase prices were allocated to ipr d 
in  million was allocated to ipr d from the netscreen acquisition and was expensed during the year 
projects that qualify as ipr d represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
at the time of acquisition  funk  peribit  kagoor  and netscreen had multiple ipr d efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
for funk  these efforts included development of new versions for the steel belted radius sbr  sbr high availability ha  and mobile ip module mim ii products all related to the radius product offering 
ipr d as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for endpoint assurance  proxy remote control  and odyssey product families 
at the time of the funk acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
for peribit  these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the sequence reducer sr family  sequence mirror sm family  the central management system cms products  as well as a hardware program for both the sr and sm families 
at the time of the peribit acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
for kagoor  these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems 
at the time of the kagoor acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
as of december   the estimated costs to complete the above research and development efforts were approximately million 
for netscreen  these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips  as well as other functions and features such as next generation internet protocol ip  wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over ip capability 
we utilized the discounted cash flow dcf method to value the ipr d  using rates ranging from to  depending on the estimated useful life of the technology 
in applying the dcf method  the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated  over the remaining economic life of the technology 
to distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues  adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets  working capital  and other assets that provide value to the product lines 
at the time of the netscreen acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
as of december   there was no remaining costs associated with these research and development efforts restructuring  impairments  and special charges we implemented several restructuring plans from to as a result of product discontinuation and the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen 
restructuring  impairments  and special charges in included adjustments of million primarily related to our restructuring accruals when we re occupied a portion of the former netscreen facility previously included in the acquisition related reserve 
the credit was partially offset by a million charge associated with the impairment of our purchased intangible assets related to kagoor 
integration costs we incurred immaterial integration expenses for the five acquisitions and approximately million for the netscreen acquisition in integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies 
the integration expenses consisted principally of facility related expenses  workforce related expenses and professional fees 
we estimate that the majority of the integration costs related to our and acquisitions have been incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for these acquisitions in the foreseeable future 

table of contents other income and expenses the following table shows other income and expenses in millions year ended december  interest and other income interest and other expense write down of equity investments loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes gain on sale of equity or available for sale investments interest and other income increased million from to as a result of higher cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments 
interest and other income decreased million from to the decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains 
interest and other expenses decreased million from to primarily due to the retirement of the subordinated notes during  resulting in savings of million  which was partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and bank fees 
interest expense decreased million from to  almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our subordinated notes 
we have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost  adjusted for any impairment  as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies 
we wrote down these investments by million and million in and  respectively  for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary 
in  we recorded a gain of million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio 
our cost basis of this equity investment was million 
during  we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as available for sale  which had a cost basis of million  and recognized gains of million 
we spent million  and million during and  respectively  to retire our subordinated notes 
we recognized net losses of million and million during and  respectively 
the losses were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement  including unamortized debt costs  and the amount paid to extinguish such notes 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the effective rate was and differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the benefit of tax credits and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation dividend under the american jobs creation act of we repatriated million in we recorded a net tax benefit in of million related to this repatriation dividend 
the net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision  net of federal benefit  of million  offset by a tax benefit of million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings 
provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the effective rate was and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses 
segment information a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we began to track financial information by our three operating segments during as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income 

table of contents we have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended december  for comparative purposes 
financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows in millions year ended december  net revenues infrastructure service layer technologies service total net revenues operating income management operating income infrastructure service layer technologies service total management operating income amortization of purchased intangible assets stock based compensation expense related to acquisitions ipr d restructuring  impairments  and special charges  net patent expense integration costs total operating income infrastructure operating segment infrastructure segment net revenues increased from to and from to due to the adoption and expansion of ip networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network 
the following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped years ended december  infrastructure chassis revenue units infrastructure ports shipped we track infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth 
our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port 
the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 
chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period 
management operating income increased from to and from to primarily due to increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units 
the increase was partially offset by higher personnel related costs primarily related to support product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels 
service layer technologies operating segment slt segment net revenues increased from to and from to primarily due to the netscreen acquisition in  and to a lesser extent  the funk  peribit  redline  and kagoor acquisitions and increases in the sales of firewall products in 
table of contents management operating income increased from to and from to primarily due to increases in net revenue  partially offset by increased expenses primarily related to product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels 
additionally  the purchase accounting adjustments related to the netscreen acquisition negatively impacted the revenue and management operating results in service operating segment net service revenues increased in compared to primarily due to the growth in support services and  to a lesser degree  the growth in professional services 
the growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base 
service management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the infrastructure segment and the slt segment  partially offset by increases in operating costs  primarily due to personnel related costs 
however  in absolute dollars  employee related expenses increased as a result of increased headcounts 
expenses associated with spares also increased as a result of revenue growth 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities 
the following table shows our capital resources in millions as of december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments restricted cash working capital working capital increased million from to due to cash provided by operations of million  partially offset by net cash used in investing activities 
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months 
in addition  there are no transactions  arrangements  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources

table of contents b our principal commitment as of december  was our outstanding zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  senior notes 
the senior notes were issued in june and are senior unsecured obligations  rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt  and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes 
the senior notes bear no interest  but are convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by juniper networks 
the conversion rate is shares per each  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the carrying value of the senior notes as of december  was million 
c we do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply  the contract manufacturers place non cancelable  non returnable ncnr orders  which were valued at million as of december   based on our build forecasts 
we do not take ownership of the components and the ncnr orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers 
the components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers 
we do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customer s order and the order ships 
however  if the components go unused  we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges 
as of december   we had accrued million based on our estimate of such charges

financing activities net cash provided in financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans 
we spent million  and million during and  respectively  to retire our subordinated notes 
we spent million during to retire million shares of our common stock 
during  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of the senior notes 
in january and february of  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share as part of our common stock repurchase program 
the repurchase did not have a material impact on our liquidity 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 

table of contents generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas r on january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods modified prospective method or modified retrospective method 
we plan to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we will recognize in our results of operations the compensation cost for stock based awards issued after december  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for stock based awards issued prior to january   we amortize the related compensation costs using the graded vesting method 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of the sfas r fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations because the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings 
the pre tax balance of unearned stock based compensation to be expensed in the period through related to share based awards unvested as of december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  was approximately million 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase  or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
we anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in the fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above  as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it depends on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current standard 
this requirement will likely reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future as they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election and accounting for tax effects 
the guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the additional paid in capital apic pool for the beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  beginning on january  in addition  this fsp addresses that when the alternative apic pool calculation is used  tax benefits related to certain employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within the statements of cash flows 
the fsp allows companies up to one year from the later of the adoption date of sfas r or november  to evaluate the available transition alternatives and make a one time election 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the new method provided by this guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures

the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts it is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december    and  in other income expense in our results of operations
