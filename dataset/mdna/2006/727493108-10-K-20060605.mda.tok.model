overview we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer  and marketer of lightweight communications headsets  telephone headset systems  and accessories for the business and consumer markets under the plantronics brand 
we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer of high quality computer and home entertainment sound systems  portable audio products  and a line of headsets  headphones  and microphones for personal digital media under our altec lansing brand 
in addition  we manufacture and market under our clarity brand specialty telephone products  such as telephones for the hearing impaired  and other related products for people with special communication needs 
we also provide audio enhancement software and products to consumers  audio professionals and businesses under our volume logic brand 
we ship a broad range of communications products to countries through a worldwide network of distributors  original equipment manufacturers oem s  wireless carriers  retailers  and telephony service providers 
we have well developed distribution channels in north america  europe  australia and new zealand  where use of our products is widespread 
our distribution channels in other regions of the world are less mature  and while we primarily serve the headset contact center markets in those regions  we are expanding into the office  mobile and entertainment  digital audio  and specialty telephone markets in the additional international locations 
on april   we acquired of the outstanding shares of octiv  inc  which was renamed volume logic  inc volume logic for approximately million  and on august   we acquired of the outstanding shares of altec lansing technologies  inc altec lansing for approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition of altec lansing  we now have two reportable segments 
we include our original plantronics business as well as the volume logic business in the audio communications group 
our altec lansing business and certain research  development  and engineering initiatives  which commenced at the beginning of the first quarter of  are included in the audio entertainment group 
ar 
table of contents our consolidated financial results for fiscal includes approximately eight months of results for the altec lansing business  which represents the most significant impact to our consolidated statement of operations on a year over year basis 
consolidated net revenues increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this growth was primarily attributable to revenues of million from our recently acquired audio entertainment group as well as new wireless products within the office and mobile product categories 
our gross margin as a percent of revenues and our operating income decreased from fiscal  due to an unfavorable product mix  continuing price pressures  especially in our consumer business  non cash charges resulting from purchase accounting  and higher expenses across all functions  including manufacturing and operating expenses 
these factors have been partially offset by the increase in revenues from the audio entertainment group 
in addition  during fiscal  we generated million in operating cash flows 
the increase in our net revenues in the audio communications group segment for fiscal was primarily driven by sales of our wireless office products and bluetooth mobile products 
in each of these markets  the trend towards wireless products contributed significantly to demand but was offset by flat sales of our corded headsets and lower net revenues from our gaming products 
we have experienced substantial growth in our wireless and bluetooth enabled products compared to a year ago  despite launching our new suite of bluetooth products towards the end of the second quarter of fiscal wireless products continue to represent an opportunity for high growth  both for the office market and for mobile applications 
the gross margin percentage for wireless products tends to be lower than for corded products 
in the office market  the lower gross margins are due to higher costs for the components required to enable wireless communication 
in the mobile market  particularly for consumer applications  margins are lower due to the higher cost of the solutions relative to corded products  the level of competition and pricing pressures  and the concentrated industry structure into which we sell 
our strategy for improving the profitability of mobile consumer products is to differentiate our products from our competitors and to provide compelling solutions under our brand with regard to features  design  ease of use  and performance 
the results of the audio entertainment group segment were accretive to consolidated earnings for fiscal due to strong sales of our portable speakers under our inmotion tm brand 
our inmotion tm products include portable audio systems for mp  cd  and other portable audio players  and the strong sales for these products result from the strong growth in the mp player market  led by apple s ipod success 
we believe this market offers a significant growth opportunity for us during fiscal  however  this market is becoming increasingly competitive  with new brands entering the portable speaker category 
our fiscal results reflect our commitment to long term growth  and the significant progress on our key initiatives we launched in fiscal to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the office  contact center  mobile and entertainment markets  and to meet the challenges associated with competitive pricing  market share  and consumer acceptance 
some of our key initiatives and results are as follows bringing advanced technologies to market 
there is an emerging trend in which the communications and entertainment spaces are converging in the wireless market 
we expect this trend to result in a demand for technologies that are simple and intuitive  utilize voice technology  control noise  and rely on miniaturization and power management 
we intend to expand our own core technology group and partner with other innovative companies to develop new technologies 
our newly acquired volume logic business provides us with broader technology expertise  expanding beyond voice communications dsp into audio dsp 
our altec lansing business manufactures and markets high quality computer and home entertainment sound systems and a line of headsets  headphones and microphones for personal digital media 
we believe that bringing our product concepts to market will be more effective if we have an audio plantronics 
table of contents part ii brand to stand alongside our voice communications brand  and that as a supplier to key channel partners  we will become a more important supplier if we can satisfy a broader set of audio needs 
we expect that the costs related to the expansion of our own core technology group  including volume logic  will increase our research  development and engineering expenses for the next fiscal year 
integration of altec lansing 
the altec lansing business is complex  with significant overseas operations 
we have evaluated various options in our integration plan to preserve the strengths of the altec lansing business model and its success in the retail markets while incorporating efficiencies and synergies into our combined company  and we are in the process of implementing these plans 
the integration effort represents a significant cost to the combined company both in terms of time commitment for the selling  general and administrative associates and anticipated future costs for the audio entertainment group for systems integration  infrastructure alignment  as well as costs associated with being part of a publicly traded company 
development and launch of new products 
during fiscal  the audio communications group launched and shipped several new models in our new suite of bluetooth products 
these products have had strong market acceptance  and we expect to see further growth from these new products in the next fiscal year 
going forward  we plan to continue to develop and enhance functionality on these platforms 
we expect that the costs related to the development of new bluetooth products and models will continue to increase our research  development and engineering expenses for the next fiscal year 
in addition to our new suite of bluetooth products  we introduced new products for the office and entertainment markets in late fiscal  which include products from the newly acquired audio entertainment group  such as the im portable ipod speakers and the xm speakers for xm satellite based radio receivers 
greater focus on branding and marketing 
we believe that consumer marketing is highly relevant for both our segments and leads to the adoption of our headsets and consumer awareness of our products 
therefore  we have been increasing our marketing capability 
by expanding our marketing headcount in the audio communications group  including hiring key personnel and highlighting key products in an advertising program  we believe we have strengthened our brand position for the consumer markets and helped category adoption 
on july   we launched a us focused integrated marketing campaign highlighting plantronics historic role in the moon landing 
we spent approximately million a significant increase from prior years on our marketing campaign  which included television and print ads  new packaging  a new tagline of sound innovation tm  a new corporate logo  and a promotion in which consumers have an opportunity to win a trip to space 
we received positive responses from our survey measuring brand awareness and brand preference before and after the campaign within our target market of mobile professionals and  as a result  we have decided increase our marketing campaign in the next year 
in europe  we launched a smaller scale wireless office campaign during fiscal  which we believe contributed significantly to the growth of our european net revenues  particularly in our bluetooth mobile and wireless office products 
building consumer product manufacture infrastructure 
the consumer products market is characterized by cost competitiveness resulting in a predominantly china based manufacturing infrastructure 
our audio entertainment group products are either manufactured by our plant in dongguan  china or purchased from predominantly china based vendors 
in order to gain more flexibility in our supply chain  to better manage inventories and reduce long term costs for our audio communications group products  we completed the construction of a manufacturing facility and design center in suzhou  china in february of and began commercial operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we spent a total of million ar 
table of contents on the construction of the facility in suzhou  china and had a project to date spending of approximately million  of which million was for the total construction costs of the building 
development of a leading industrial design team and facilities 
we recently expanded our design team and are now adding a new design center at our corporate headquarters in santa cruz 
our strengthened industrial design team is focused on enhancing the look of our audio communications group products  which we believe is a key factor in the customer s decision to buy 
we expect that the costs of the larger design team will increase our research  development and engineering expenses in the next fiscal year 
throughout fiscal  we have remained focused on our overall long term strategy for the audio communications group  which is to increase headset adoption in the enterprise markets through the creation of new products that are appealing in functionality and design and combining these products with marketing programs to increase awareness and interest 
through the acquisition of altec lansing and the establishment of the audio entertainment group  we moved closer to obtaining our long term goal of positioning ourselves to produce products that will meet the consumer needs in an increasing convergence trend of communications and entertainment 
the potential for future growth will depend on our efforts to expand customer awareness and our ability to successfully launch new products 
looking forward into fiscal  we are focused on the following key corporate goals to maximize corporate profits increase the adoption of our products in the office markets 
growing the office markets  through the introduction of compelling  easy to use  wireless products and demand generation campaigns will continue to be our top priority 
reduce manufacturing costs  particularly for our bluetooth products 
we have opportunities to decrease manufacturing costs by improving supply chain flexibility  taking advantage of the low manufacturing costs in china  improving the efficiency of transforming raw materials into finished goods  decreasing our logistics costs  improving our design process for product manufacturability  and enhancing tools that support and enable decisions and execution in these areas 
achieving competitive advantage by reducing our cost structure  particularly in the bluetooth market  is a critical objective for fiscal and beyond 
improve efficiency in marketing and new product development 
we plan to continue our brand awareness and demand generation programs  targeting the wireless office market in order to maximize revenues and to build on the awareness raised from our fiscal marketing campaigns 
the costs for the office wireless demand generation program  which are expected to be approximately million  will be reflected in the selling  general and administrative line of our statement of operations 
we believe that our fiscal sales for the wireless office  our bluetooth products for bluetooth enabled devices such as mobile phones and other pda s  gaming and voip computer headsets  and our entertainment products  especially the portable category  will continue to experience strong growth rates 
these growth opportunities  however  will be partially offset by an expected decline in our corded mobile business and flat year over year results in our corded office and contact center products 
we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements 
plantronics

we make products for use with office and contact center phones  for use with mobile and cordless phones  and for use with computers and gaming consoles 
historically  the office and contact center products have represented our largest source of revenues while the mobile products have represented our largest unit volumes 
revenues may vary due to the timing of the introduction of new products  seasonality  discounts and other incentives and channel mix 
there is a growing trend toward wireless products and a corresponding shift away from our corded products 
we have a book and ship business model  whereby we ship most orders to our customers within hours of receipt of those orders 
thus  we cannot rely on the level of backlog to provide visibility into potential future revenues 
plantronics 
table of contents part ii for the year as a whole  our acg segment net revenues grew to million on the strength of our wireless headset offerings both for the office and for bluetooth mobile applications 
office and contact center in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal office and contact center net revenues growth was primarily due to increased sales of our office wireless headsets  particularly our cs  a wireless headset for mhz based office phones  the cs  a wireless headset for dect based office phones  our plantronics voyager s  a wireless headset using bluetooth technology for use with office phones  and other voice enabled bluetooth devices 
net revenues for the office wireless headsets increased in fiscal compared to the prior year  again reflecting the trend toward wireless products 
we have focused a significant part of our marketing efforts and our national advertising campaign on promoting office wireless products  and we believe that the office market represents a significant opportunity 
revenue growth in this category will be closely linked to an increase in adoption of wireless office products in this category 
we anticipate that there will be more competition within the office cordless market  and that pricing may adversely impact revenues 
sales of professional grade corded headsets for office and contact center applications were relatively flat  year over year 
the office and call center corded market is a mature market 
sales of corded products for the office have declined  but this decrease was offset by increased sales in the contact center market 
while we have been anticipating the trend toward wireless products  the rate at which customers are adopting wireless headsets has accelerated in the latter part of fiscal we anticipate that near term growth in this market will primarily be derived from the contact center market as well as from growth in the asia pacific and latin america office markets 
mobile in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal mobile net revenues decreased primarily due to a decline of approximately in sales of corded products  again reflecting the trend toward wireless products 
net revenues from our bluetooth products grew as a result of increased availability  increased adoption of bluetooth products in the market  and the introduction of our new suite of bluetooth headsets explorer  discovery  plantronics voyager s  plantronics voyager  and the pulsar headset family  which were introduced at the end of our second quarter of fiscal the increase in our bluetooth headset revenues was insufficient to cover the decrease in corded net revenues 
the primary reasons for the lower mobile net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal are as follows throughout fiscal  we had significantly lower shipments to some of our key wireless oem carrier partners  particularly for the corded mobile products  in fiscal  a major customer purchased our corded mobile headsets to include in promotional bundles with sales of cell phones in the first quarter of while we continued to participate in such bundles with this customer in fiscal  the number of such bundles was lower than it was a year ago  and the growing trend toward wireless headsets has shifted revenues from corded headsets 
we experienced delays in introducing our new suite of bluetooth products in the second quarter  and as a result  we missed growth opportunities 
the bluetooth market is characterized by significant growth and represents our best opportunity for unit volume increases  however  this market is characterized by intense price competition 
therefore  net revenues for bluetooth products are not expected to grow at the same rate as unit volumes 
ar 
table of contents gaming and computer audio in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal gaming and computer audio net revenues decreased predominantly due to a decline in revenues of our halo edition of the gamecom headset for the xbox  as consumer interest in the halo headset peaked during the holiday and post holiday sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal this decline in gaming headsets was offset by growth in pc headsets  driven by the increasing use of voip by consumers 
we launched a number of new products  including a new 
audio family  toward the end of fiscal other specialty products in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal specialty product net revenues  which consist primarily of our clarity products marketed for hearing impaired individuals  decreased slightly 
we anticipate that net revenues for this category will slightly increase in fiscal domestic and international in comparison to fiscal  we experienced growth in fiscal for all of our major international regions  both in the asia pacific latin america region apla which increased  and in our europe  middle east  and africa emea region  which increased 
this growth  particularly in the wireless office and bluetooth mobile headsets  was broad based across all of our major product groups  except for our mobile products in the emea regions 
audio entertainment group fiscal year ended march  march  increase in thousands decrease audio entertainment group net revenues from customers total segment net revenues the audio entertainment group is engaged in the design  manufacture  sales  marketing and support of audio solutions and related technologies 
it offers computer and digital audio systems  digital radio frequency audio systems  and portable audio products as well as headphones and microphones for personal digital media 
major product categories include portable audio  which is defined as all speakers whether ac or battery powered that work with portable digital players  such as ipod or mp players  powered audio  which is defined as self powered speaker systems used for computers and other multi media application systems  and personal audio headphones and interactive audio headsets 
currently  all the revenues in the audio entertainment group are derived from altec lansing products 
in fiscal  net revenues represent results since the acquisition of altec lansing on august   and thus reflect only a seven and a half month period of revenues rather than a year of revenues 
portable audio and powered audio accounted for approximately and of audio entertainment group net revenues 
personal audio  and interactive audio make up the remainder 
because the altec lansing products are primarily consumer goods sold in the retail channel  the holiday sales in the december quarter account for a seasonal spike in net revenues  which is not continued into the next quarters when sales return to a more normalized and lower level 
this seasonality has a major impact on quarterly results 
the strength of the mp market contributed heavily to sales of altec lansing speaker products in the portable products category  which attach to mp players 
the strong growth of the mp market plantronics 
table of contents part ii represents a significant opportunity for unit volume increases  however  this market is highly competitive and fast changing 
in fiscal  we introduced an entry level portable speaker for use with the ipod  the im  and a powered usb 
two piece speaker system  the xt domestic and international domestic revenues for fiscal were approximately of total net revenues 
the international revenues of the audio entertainment group are primarily derived from the european markets 
revenues may vary due to seasonality  timing of the introduction of new products  discounts and other incentives  and channel mix 
other trends which will also impact our audio entertainment group revenues include growth of the mp player market  and our ability to successfully attach to new generations of mp players and to develop products which keep up with the rapidly developing portable and personal audio markets 
consolidated fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands march  march  increase march  march  increase decrease decrease consolidated by geographic region united states europe  middle east and africa asia pacific and latin america canada and other international total international total consolidated net revenues in comparison to fiscal  the increase in the consolidated net revenues in fiscal is primarily attributable to the additional net revenues of million resulting from the acquisition of altec lansing and growth in the office and contact center products  especially in our wireless products 
this increase has been partially offset by a decrease in our mobile headset net revenues  driven primarily by lower corded revenues and lower net revenues from our gaming products 
the wireless market  coupled with a trend toward the convergence of communications and entertainment  continues to grow  with net revenues up compared to a year ago 
in addition  our total net revenues from wireless products for fiscal account for approximately of our total audio communications group net revenues compared to in fiscal consolidated net revenues from domestic sales for fiscal  as a percentage of total net revenues  decreased from approximately to  compared to a year ago 
net revenues from international sales for fiscal  as a percentage of total net revenue  increased from to  respectively  compared to a year ago 
in comparison to fiscal  the increase in net sales for fiscal was geographically broad based and across all major product lines and sales channels 
the increase was driven primarily by continued sales of ar 
table of contents our new product lines 
both domestic and international revenues were up  resulting  in part  from increased demand for headsets for mobile phones and wireless headsets for the office  as well as from the favorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international revenues 
the increase in our office and contact center net revenues was linked to the continued success of our cs  cs and the supraplus headsets 
the increase in net revenues of our gaming and computer products was primarily attributable to shipments of our halo headset for the xbox and revenues from headsets for voip applications 
mobile product net revenues saw strong growth with the mx and bluetooth related products 
the increases were primarily attributable to two factors one  in the us wireless carrier market  we participated in promotional bundles which were offered by wireless carriers  and two  increased demand for bluetooth enabled headsets  particularly in europe where this technology has greater market acceptance than in the us market 
net revenues from our specialty products  which are principally our clarity products marketed for hearing impaired individuals  grew primarily from sales of new product models  wireless products and increased distribution through our retail channels 
international revenues for fiscal were favorably affected by the continued strengthening of the european exchange rates against the us dollar  sales of our cs product  and sales related to voip applications and bluetooth

in comparison to fiscal  gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased percentage points in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs due to the following an increase in capacity in our production facilities in suzhou  china and tijuana  mexico in preparation for anticipated future demand 
during fiscal  we constructed a new manufacturing and design center in suzhou 
full utilization of our new facility in china is expected to be achieved late in fiscal while net revenues are up year over year  production volume in the facility in mexico is down  as a result of the changing mix of products from lower cost corded products to higher cost wireless products  on new products  the yield has been below and unit costs have been above our targeted levels  and we incurred higher scrap costs due to new product launches  further contributing to the decline in gross profit  requirements for excess and obsolete inventory increased due to unanticipated shifts in demand  and the cost of our warranty obligations was higher due in part to higher revenues and in part  to an increase in consumer products which have a higher rate of return under warranty  a product mix shift toward consumer products coupled with continued pricing pressure  especially on consumer bluetooth headsets  which resulted in less favorable margins  and plantronics 
table of contents part ii higher freight and duty costs resulting from a higher proportion of more expensive air shipments than cheaper ocean shipments 
we expect gross profit pressures from the factors mentioned above as well as from competitive pricing to continue for the near future 
we are focused on actions to improve our gross profit through supply chain management  improvements in product launches  increasing the utilization of manufacturing capacity  particularly in our new facility in china  and improving the effectiveness of our marketing programs 
product mix has a significant impact on gross profit  as there can be significant variances between our higher and our lower margin products 
therefore  small variations in product mix  which can be difficult to predict  can have a significant impact on gross profit

in fiscal  gross profit represents results since the acquisition of altec lansing on august  gross profit for the period has been negatively impacted by the following key factors a percentage point impact due to purchase accounting 
we recorded million relating to the manufacturing profit capitalized to inventories  all of which was fully amortized by the end of the third quarter of fiscal we also had million in amortization expense relating to technology assets acquired in the altec lansing acquisition 
the amortization expense associated with the technology assets is expected to continue to reduce gross profit for the next six to eight years  a provision for excess and obsolete materials due to an unanticipated shift in demand  and royalties payable to third parties 
certain products require royalties to be paid to third parties  and the mix of products for which royalties are required to be paid can negatively impact gross profit 
gross profit may vary depending on the product mix  competitive pricing pressures  amount of excess and obsolete inventory charges  return rates  the amount of product sold in which royalties are required to be paid and the rate at which royalties are calculated  and other factors 
a further shift towards the newer  but lower margin  portable products may cause downward pressure on our gross profit

in comparison to fiscal  the increase in the consolidated gross profit in fiscal is primarily attributable to incremental gross margin of million from our acquisition of altec lansing and overall higher revenues 
despite the incremental gross profit from the audio entertainment group  our gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased by approximately eight percentage points which is attributable to two main factors 
one  manufacturing costs in the audio communications group increased 
two  altec lansing s gross profit as a percentage of revenues  including the impact of purchase accounting  is lower than the plantronics core business gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
therefore  by combining the lower gross profit of the audio entertainment business with the higher gross profit of the audio communications business  the gross profit of the consolidated company is reduced 
our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china began production in the fourth quarter fiscal as a result  depreciation expense associated with the facility commenced in the fourth quarter  which has caused and will continue to cause  higher costs in the short run and will negatively affect our gross profits 
once our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china is running at full utilization  we expect that this facility  assuming other factors remain constant  will reduce manufacturing costs and thus improve gross profit 
in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal gross profit margins decreased slightly  which was primarily due to a product mix shift towards lower margin products  particularly our bluetooth products within our mobile products  and a greater contribution of wireless products within our office and contact center products 
these were offset in part by continued component cost reductions  manufacturing efficiencies and favorable exchange rates net of hedging losses 
gross profit margin may vary depending on the product mix  customer mix  channel mix  amount of excess and obsolete inventory charges  changes in our warranty repair costs or return rates  royalty payments  competitive pricing and discounts or customer incentives  and other factors 
research  development and engineering research  development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs  outside services  including legal fees associated with protecting our intellectual property  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities  human resources  and it costs

research  development and engineering expense of the audio communications group reflects our commitment to developing new products for the markets we serve 
research  development and engineering expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following incremental spending in our ongoing design and development of wireless products  including a new suite of bluetooth products  featuring a new chip set and a re vamped style and design geared for the more fashion conscious market 
these new  third generation bluetooth products include the plantronics discovery  plantronics explorer  pulsar a and plantronics voyager s  which were launched late in the second quarter of fiscal we launched additional new products during the year  including the supraplus wireless  a dect wireless headset for the office market  released in the fourth quarter of fiscal  growth in our design centers in mexico and china where we spent million and million  respectively  in fiscal the costs at these design centers are primarily associated with payroll and payroll related costs due to higher headcount 
our strategy is to have project execution  build  and verification processes co located with the teams that are responsible for the manufacturing in order to improve execution  efficiency  and cost effectiveness  high expenses for project materials  relating to verification builds of these newly launched products  additional expenses to develop new technology  including technology acquired through volume logic  and increased legal fees to protect our intellectual property

the fair value was calculated based on the present value of the future estimated cash flows applying a discount rate  and adjusted for the estimated cost to complete and the risk of not achieving technological feasibility 
because the in process technology  which had been valued at million  was not yet complete  there was risk that the developments would not be completed  therefore  this amount was immediately expensed at acquisition to research  development and engineering expense

in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily for the following reasons an increase in global sales and marketing programs designed to generate demand for our wireless office  gaming  voip products  and other new products  new marketing programs to leverage hands free regulatory laws  especially in the japanese market  launch new products  and start a national brand awareness program  costs related to work performed for our sarbanes oxley section compliance and attestation fees  and an adverse impact from higher foreign exchange rates  particularly with the great british pound and the euro against the dollar 
these expenses were partially offset by a one time benefit of approximately million from a favorable court ruling  which ended a lawsuit filed by one of our competitors during the quarter ended september  we anticipate our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the next fiscal year 
we also plan to continue our office demand generation campaign in fiscal and expect to spend approximately million on this campaign over the next fiscal year

in comparison to fiscal  our fiscal operating income decreased primarily due to lower gross profit percentages and higher operating costs of our audio communication business despite higher net revenues and the incremental operating income of million associated with the acquisition of altec lansing 
as a result  operating income decreased from to as a percentage of revenue 
in comparison to fiscal  operating income for fiscal increased primarily from higher revenues and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues due to economies of scale  but was partially offset by lower margin products as a result of the change in our product mix 
as a result  operating margin increased from to 
we believe that our operating margins will be impacted by the recent trends in our business and industry  including a flat to down trend on revenues derived from professional grade corded headsets  the rapid growth of the bluetooth consumer market with continued intense price competition and other factors such as generally shorter product life cycles 
our operating margin will also be significantly affected by the option expensing pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas r  which will be adopted in the first quarter of fiscal we expect the compensation charges under sfas r will reduce net income by approximately to million in fiscal however  management s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award

in comparison to fiscal  income tax expense in fiscal was negatively impacted by the acquisition of altec lansing  which has a higher tax rate than our core plantronics business 
this effective rate increase was offset in part by special incentives that plantronics received under the maquiladora program in mexico and additional tax credits that we received for expansion of our research and development in mexico 
during fiscal and  the successful completion of routine tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations resulted in favorable tax adjustments of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting the million favorable tax adjustments in was a write off of million relating to a tax asset that was recorded in connection with the leveraged buy out that occurred in september of this tax asset arose in connection with the book versus tax basis difference on certain fixed assets 
management and the audit committee evaluated this write off and determined that it was immaterial to prior years reported results and to the fiscal results  so the adjustment was included in income tax expense in fiscal in fiscal  our deferred tax assets were not subject to any valuation allowances 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized 
as of march   we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit of all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable 
pre tax earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively

table of contents we are currently estimating an effective tax rate of approximately in fiscal this estimated rate includes the impact of the adoption of sfas r which could result in a more volatile rate quarter over quarter 
the tax rate could also be impacted by whether or not the federal research and development tax credit is reinstated and if reinstated  the date of reinstatement 
the federal research and development tax credit expired december  and has not since been reinstated 
we also have significant operations in various tax jurisdictions 
currently  some of these operations are taxed at rates substantially lower than us tax rates 
if our income in these lower tax jurisdictions no longer qualified for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed  our tax rate would be materially affected 
on october   the president of the united states of america signed the american jobs creation act of the ajca 
the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
we evaluated opportunities to remit cash under the ajca  however  we determined that we had alternative uses for the foreign cash overseas 
accordingly  we did not remit any cash back to the united states under this provision 
permanently reinvested foreign earnings were approximately million at march  the determination of the tax liability that would be incurred if these amounts were remitted back to the united states is not practicable

operating cash flows in fiscal  compared to fiscal  decreased by million  which is primarily attributable to lower net income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this lower income is predominantly due to lower gross profit of the audio communication group due to higher cost of sales and higher operating expenses  particularly our national ad campaign in which we spent approximately million 
depreciation and amortization expense was also substantially higher in fiscal increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to additional property  plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired in the purchase of altec lansing 
the remaining difference relates to adjustments to net income primarily due to changes in deferred taxes

table of contents part ii operating cash flow in fiscal was impacted by increases in inventory balances primarily related to raw material purchases for manufacturing our of newly introduced bluetooth and wireless office products due to higher demand 
average annual inventory turns decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal accounts receivable increased significantly as a result of a higher level of sales and linearity of sales higher at the end of the fourth quarter than historical results  offset by strong cash collections  and the addition of the audio entertainment group receivables 
our average annual days sales outstanding dso slightly increased from days in fiscal to days in fiscal in international locations  trade terms that are standard in a particular locale may extend longer than is standard in the us this may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative impact on our cash flow provided by operating activities 
the cash outflows in operating activities for increased receivables and inventory are offset  in part  by an increase in the accounts payable balance due to the timing of payments for increased purchases of raw materials 
operating cash flows in fiscal  compared to fiscal  increased by million  which is primarily attributable to higher net income earned on higher sales volume and offset  in part  by higher inventory and accounts receivable balances 
our inventory balances increased proportionally with increased revenues  decisions to increase our inventory safety stock  and other factors 
the accounts receivable increase was primarily driven by the strong growth in sales coupled with the impact of the strengthening of the great british pound and the euro against the us dollar 
new accounting rules effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal require that a portion of the cash benefits resulting from the tax deductibility of increases in the value of equity instruments issued under share based arrangements be included as part of cash flows from financing activities rather than from operating activities 
this change in classification will likely have a significant negative effect on our cash provided by operating activities in periods after adoption of these new rules 
see recent accounting pronouncements included in note of the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results  collection of accounts receivable  changes to inventory levels and timing of payments 
we also intend to increase our marketing expenditures to promote our wireless office products in fiscal to a total of approximately million 
cash flows from investing activities in fiscal  we used million in cash for investing activities compared to million used in fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to cash payments related to the acquisitions of altec lansing and octiv of million and million  respectively 
other uses of cash were million in capital expenditures  including million for our suzhou  china manufacturing and design facility  which commenced operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and therefore  began to depreciate in the fourth quarter of fiscal other capital purchases include leasehold improvements at our corporate headquarters  machinery and equipment  tooling  computers  and software 
the cash outflows from investing activities were offset in part by net proceeds of million total purchases of million and proceeds of million from the sale of short term investments 
most of these proceeds were used for the funding of the altec lansing acquisition 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily comprised of capital expenditures of million  including million for our china manufacturing and design facility 
the remainder of the capital purchases was incurred principally in tooling for new products  furniture and fixtures  and ar 
table of contents building improvements for facilities expansion  principally in our santa cruz headquarters 
additionally  we purchased approximately million of marketable securities  which were offset by sales and maturities of a portion of our marketable securities of approximately million 
we anticipate making further investments in short term investments as interest rates continue to rise in order to obtain more favorable yields 
as our business grows  we may need additional facilities and capital expenditures to support this growth 
we plan to finish the building improvements in our santa cruz headquarters in fiscal we will continue to evaluate new business opportunities and new markets 
if we pursue new opportunities or markets in areas in which we do not have existing facilities  we may need additional expenditures to support future expansion 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal  cash flows used for financing activities were approximately million compared to million in fiscal the significant increase in fiscal is primarily due to the following key cash outflows the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million  at an average price of per share 
the board of directors authorized us to repurchase an additional  shares of common stock under our th and th share repurchase programs 
as of march    shares remained authorized for repurchase  and cash dividends totaling million 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million of financing under our credit facility  net of million of aggregate principal payments  used for the acquisition of altec lansing  proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling million and the re issuance of  shares of our treasury stock through employee benefit plans totaling million 
in fiscal  cash flows used for financing activities were approximately million 
this was primarily due to repurchases of  shares of our common stock totaling million at an average price of per share and payment of cash dividends totaling million 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized plantronics to repurchase an additional  shares of common stock 
as of march   we were authorized to repurchase  shares under all repurchase plans 
these cash outflows were offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling million and re issuance of  shares of our treasury stock through employee benefit plans totaling million 
on may   we announced that our board of directors had declared a cash dividend of per share of our common stock  payable on june  to stockholders of record on may  the plan approved by the board anticipates a total annualized dividend of per common share 
the actual declaration of future dividends  and the establishment of record and payment dates  is subject to final determination by the audit committee of the board of directors of plantronics each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources our primary discretionary cash requirements historically have been for capital expenditures  including tooling for new products and leasehold improvements for facilities expansion  however  in fiscal  we spent million on the construction of our new manufacturing and design facility in suzhou  china  million on the expansion of the santa cruz headquarters building for the construction of the new industrial design wing  as well as improvements at our plamex manufacturing site in tijuana  mexico

table of contents part ii at march   we had working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared with working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at march  during fiscal  we entered into a second amendment to our credit agreement  which extended the revolving termination date from august  to august   increased the revolving credit from million to million  and reduced the interest rate spread over libor from to 
we drew down an initial million under the credit facility to finance the acquisition of altec lansing on august  subsequent to the initial draw  we made aggregate principal payments of million against the amount outstanding 
we expect that this line of credit will be fully repaid through monthly payments by the third quarter of fiscal our borrowings at march  were million under the credit facility 
our commitments under a letter of credit sub facility were million 
the amounts outstanding under the letter of credit sub facility are principally associated with purchases of inventory 
the terms of the credit facility contain covenants that materially limit our ability to incur additional debt and pay dividends  among other matters 
it also requires us to maintain  in addition to a minimum annual net income  a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum quick ratio 
these covenants may adversely affect us to the extent we cannot comply with them 
on august   we entered into a third amendment to our credit agreement  which provided a minor change to a financial covenant 
this change has no effect on our financial statements  our ability to incur additional debt or pay dividends 
on november   we entered into a fourth amendment to the credit agreement  which increases the amount allowed for aggregate dividends declared or paid and common stock repurchased or redeemed 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants under our amended credit agreement 
as of april   we had million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million committed under the letter of credit sub facility 
throughout fiscal and  we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  throughout fiscal and  we continued our hedging program to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues denominated in the euro and great british pound with put and call option contracts used as collars 
at each reporting period  we record the net fair value of our unrealized option contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate element of stockholders equity 
gains and losses associated with realized option contracts are recorded within revenue 
prior to the acquisition  altec lansing hedged a fixed amount of its euro denominated receivable balance 
altec lansing entered into forward contracts where it would deliver euros at fixed rates until the end of the current quarter 
open contracts at month end were marked to market and the gain or loss was immediately included in earnings 
altec lansing does not purchase options for trading purposes 
as of march   altec lansing does not have any forward contracts outstanding 
during fiscal  we ended a hedging program to hedge a portion of the china yuan payments related to forecasted construction costs for our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
we were hedging the currency exposure with forward exchange contracts 
as of march   there were no open forward contracts outstanding related to the manufacturing facility in china 
in july  the people s bank of china announced that the china yuan will be de pegged from the dollar in favor of a managed float against a basket of currencies 
as the functional currency of our chinese entity is the us dollar  the ar 
table of contents impact of any future revaluations would be determined by the amount of the change in the currency rate  which could have a negative impact on future production costs 
our liquidity  capital resources  and results of operations in any period could be affected by the exercise of outstanding stock options  sale of restricted stock to employees  and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares could affect our per share results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the sale or exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all 
in fiscal  we expect to spend roughly million in capital expenditures  which includes the expansion and improvement of our facilities at our santa cruz headquarters and industrial design center  and our warehouse in milford  pennsylvania 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operations  and our line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty 
see certain forward looking information and risk factors in this annual report for factors that could affect our estimates for future financial needs and sources of working capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing and liquidity support or market risk or credit risk support to the company 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the contractual obligations that we were reasonably likely to incur as of march  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands total thereafter operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon plantronics consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we base estimates and judgments on plantronics 
table of contents part ii historical experience and on various other factors that plantronics management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts excess and obsolete inventory warranty goodwill and intangibles income taxes revenue recognition revenue from sales of products to customers is recognized when the following criteria have been met title and risk of ownership are transferred to customers  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue net of estimated product returns and expected payments to resellers for customer programs including cooperative advertising  marketing development funds  volume rebates  and special pricing programs 
estimated product returns are deducted from revenues upon shipment  based on historical return rates  the product stage relative to its expected life cycle  and assumptions regarding the rate of sell through to end users from our various channels based on historical sell through rates 
should product lives vary significantly from management estimates  or should a particular selling channel experience a higher than estimated return rate  or a slower sell through rate causing inventory build up  then our estimated returns  which are recorded as a reduction to revenue  may need to be revised and therefore could have an adverse impact on revenues 
co op advertising and marketing development funds are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  we accrue for these funds as marketing expense if we receive a separately identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  the amount is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
reductions to revenue for expected and actual payments to resellers for volume rebates and pricing protection are based on actual expenses incurred during the period  estimates for what is due to resellers for estimated credits earned during the period and any adjustments for credits based on actual activity 
if the actual payments exceed management s estimates  this could result in an adverse impact on our revenues 
since management has historically been able to reliably estimate the amount of allowances required for future price adjustments and product returns  we recognize revenue  net of projected allowances  upon shipment to our customers 
in situations where management is unable to reliably estimate the amount of future price adjustments and product returns  we defer recognition of the revenue ar 
table of contents until the right to future price adjustments and product returns lapses  and we are no longer under any obligation to reduce the price or accept the return of the product 
if market conditions warrant  we may take action to stimulate demand  which could include increasing promotional programs  decreasing prices  or increasing discounts 
such actions could result in incremental reductions to revenue and margins at the time such incentives are offered 
to the extent that we reduce pricing  we may incur reductions to revenue for price protection based on management s estimate of inventory in the channel that is subject to such pricing actions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if necessary based on management s assessments of customer s ability to pay 
if the financial condition of customers should deteriorate or if actual defaults are higher than historical experience would indicate  additional allowances may be required  which could have an adverse impact on operating expenses 
inventory and excessive and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we account for abnormal amounts such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs as current period charges 
additionally  we allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
all shipping and handling costs incurred in connection with the sale of products are included in the cost of revenues 
management writes down inventory for excess and obsolete inventories 
write downs are determined by reviewing our demand forecast and by determining what inventory  if any  is not saleable 
our demand forecast projects future shipments using historical rates and takes into account market conditions  inventory on hand  purchase commitments  product development plans and product life expectancy  inventory on consignment  and other competitive factors 
if our demand forecast is greater than actual demand  and management fails to reduce manufacturing accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative impact on our gross profit 
at the point of inventory write down  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
product warranty obligations management provides for product warranties in accordance with the underlying contractual terms given to the customer or end user of the product 
the contractual terms may vary depending upon the geographic region in which the customer is located  the brand and type of product sold  and other conditions  which affect or limit the customers rights to return product under warranty 
where specific warranty return rights are given to customers  management accrues for the estimated cost of those warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
generally  warranties start at the delivery date and continue for one or two years  depending on the type and brand  and the location in which the product was purchased 
where specific warranty return rights are not given to the customer but where the customers are granted limited rights of return or discounts in lieu of warranty  management records these rights of return or discounts as adjustments to revenue 
in certain circumstances  we may sell product without warranty  and accordingly  no charge is taken for warranty 
factors that affect the warranty obligation plantronics 
table of contents part ii include sales terms  which obligate us to provide warranty  product failure rates  estimated return rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
management assesses the adequacy of the recorded warranty obligation quarterly and makes adjustments to the obligation based on actual experience and changes in estimated future return rates 
goodwill and intangibles as a result of past acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet 
goodwill has been measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the amount assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
management performs a review at least annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist to determine if the carrying value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is impaired 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting units 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates  estimated costs  and other factors  which utilize historical data  internal estimates  and  in some cases  external consultants and outside data 
if management s estimates require adjustment or if the underlying business requirements change  goodwill may become impaired  and we may be required to take an impairment charge  which would negatively impact our operating results 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from three to ten years 
purchased intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes both in the united states as well as in several foreign jurisdictions 
management must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for the financial statements 
these estimates occur in the calculation of tax benefits and deductions  tax credits  and tax assets and liabilities which are generated from differences in the timing of when items are recognized for book purposes and when they are recognized for tax purposes 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of foreign operations  tax credits  state taxes  purchase accounting  and other factors 
our future effective tax rates could be impacted by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income  tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions  changes in tax laws in the united states or internationally  a change in management s estimates of future taxable income which results in a valuation allowance being required  or a federal  state or foreign jurisdiction s view of tax returns which differs materially from what management originally provided 
management assesses the probability of adverse outcomes from tax examinations regularly to determine the adequacy of the reserve for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities to be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized 
as of march   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable  ar 
table of contents however  if there was a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would be required to take a charge in the period in which we determined that recovery was not more likely than not 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors affecting future operating results 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million at march  compared to million at march  we had marketable securities of million and million at march  and  respectively 
cash equivalents have a maturity when purchased of three months or less  short term investments have a maturity of greater than three months  and are classified as available for sale 
included in short term investments are auction rate securities whose reset dates may be less than three months  however  the maturities of the underlying securities are greater than one year 
all our investments in marketable securities are held in our name at a limited number of major financial institutions and consist of auction rate securities 
the taxable equivalent interest rates realized on these investments averaged for fiscal our investment policy generally requires that we only invest in auction rate securities  deposit accounts  certificates of deposit or commercial paper with minimum ratings of a p and money market mutual funds with minimum ratings of aaa 
we applied the same modeling technique as we used at march  to measure the hypothetical changes in fair values in our marketable securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  held at march  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
based upon our analysis  the fair values did not change materially as our investments are of short duration and the amount held at march  was not significant enough to result in a material change in fair value 
as of april   we had borrowed million under the revolving credit facility and million committed under the letter of credit sub facility 
if we choose to borrow additional amounts under this facility in the future and market interest rates rise  then our interest payments would increase accordingly 
our line of credit has a fixed borrowing rate of the then libor plus  which resulted in a weighted average rate of approximately 
this rate is fixed through to the end of the second quarter of fiscal by which date we expect to repay the entire outstanding amount 
as a result  the underlying exposure of our line of credit is not sensitive to changes in market rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are engaged in a hedging strategy to diminish  and make more predictable  the effect of currency fluctuations 
we hedge our economic exposure by hedging euro and great british pound accounts receivable and accounts payable and a portion of anticipated euro and great british pound denominated sales 
however  we have no assurance our strategy will be successfully implemented and that exchange rate fluctuations will not materially adversely affect our business in the future 
fair value hedges we hedge both our euro and great british pound accounts receivable and accounts payable by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments and underlying transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and non functional currency denominated receivables and plantronics

as of march   we also had foreign currency put option contracts of approximately million and million denominated in euros and great british pounds  respectively

we had hedged these forecasted transactions with forward currency contracts that mature in less than one year 
these transactions were designated as cash flow hedges
