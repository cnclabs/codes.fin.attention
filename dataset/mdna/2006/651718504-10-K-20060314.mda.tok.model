item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
operating environment and recent developments our operating results depend in large measure on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as on the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
most of these activities are exposed to weather conditions in each region 
the activity levels  in turn  depend on oil and gas commodities pricing  inventory levels and product demand 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average rig count data for the last five years ending december is listed in the following table us rig count canadian rig count source baker hughes incorporated our markets include the historical gulf coast market  the us central region including the us rocky mountain region  oklahoma and west texas  canada  areas surrounding the mediterranean sea and eastern europe  and mexico 
key developments our historical gulf coast oilfield market includes south louisiana land  texas railroad commission districts and  louisiana and texas inland waters  and offshore gulf of mexico 
this market accounted for approximately of revenues and of revenues 
prior to  the gulf coast oilfield market accounted for of total revenues 
the overall decline in the percentage of gulf coast revenues over the last several years is the result of our strategy to diversify our revenue base and relatively flat gulf coast market activity 
the recent increase in intense hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico had a significant impact on gulf coast revenues in the third and fourth quarters of and  to a lesser extent  in the third quarter of in the third quarter of  all of our gulf coast operations were impacted by severe weather and several of our drilling fluids and e p waste facilities sustained significant damage as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
these facilities were primarily located in venice and cameron  louisiana 
our venice facilities are expected to remain idled until early in all other facilities were operating as of december  we anticipate that we will see more activity in the offshore market in the first quarter of as customers return to more normal operating patterns 
as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  in we recorded losses totaling million  including losses related to property  plant and equipment damages totaling million  inventory losses totaling million and additional costs as a direct result of the storms totaling million 
we recorded these losses as additions to cost of revenues 
as of december   based on agreements with our insurers as to our insurance coverage  we recorded insurance recoveries totaling million  including million for property  plant and equipment  million related to additional costs as a direct result of the storms and million for business interruption  net of a  insurance deductible per occurrence 
we also recorded these insurance recoveries as 
table of contents reductions to cost of revenues 
the net effect of these losses and related recoveries is operating income of million 
we have received these insurance proceeds and have used a portion to cover expenses incurred due to the hurricanes and to replace some damaged property  plant and equipment 
we have used the remaining amount to pay down debt 
absent the recent effects of hurricanes katrina and rita  we had experienced an increase in gulf coast oilfield market activity since the beginning of however  we continue to believe that the majority of our growth will come from other markets and new product offerings in the markets we serve 
recent product and other developments over the last several years we have developed several new products and product enhancements in each of our business segments 
we have invested a significant amount of financial and human resources in developing these new products 
a large portion of these investments in product developments and enhancements have been made during an extended period of market stagnation or decline  primarily in the gulf coast market 
we believe that these investments will be a key driver in our anticipated growth in fluids sales and engineering 
we continue to develop a position in the drilling fluids market by expanding our customer base  drawing upon increasing acceptance of our proprietary deepdrill and flexdrill technologies 
we have also deployed our newphase tm product  a component of our water based product line  which is used to create high performance fluid systems tailored to the drilling problems created by the reactive shale strata encountered in the mid continent region 
we believe that certain of these new products improve the economics of the drilling process and will make it easier for our customers to comply with increasingly strict environmental regulations affecting their drilling operations 
based on customer acceptance of our technology and service capability  we anticipate introducing these products and services in several additional foreign markets 
we recently announced the execution of a memorandum of understanding to form a new company that will provide drilling fluids products and services in brazil  in partnership with a well established brazilian company 
during  our product costs increased across most of the us markets that we serve 
specifically  in the second half of  the ocean freight cost to ship barite from our foreign suppliers increased significantly 
in  raw materials costs and fuel costs have risen significantly 
these cost increases have been partially offset by price increases to our customers during we are continuing to increase prices to our customers as contracts are negotiated or renewed 
mat and integrated services 
during  pricing for mat installation and re rentals in the us oilfield market improved slightly 
we believe that prices should continue to improve and expect some increase in volume of mats installed beginning in as funds are allocated to new drilling projects 
we continue to develop the worldwide market for our dura base composite mat system 
our marketing efforts for this product remain focused in eight principal markets  including canada  alaska and the arctic  russia  the middle east  south america  mexico  indonesia  and the us utilities markets 
we have completed sales in all of these markets 
over the past several years of marketing this product and evaluating customer acceptance  we have gained valuable information and have modified our marketing and product development strategies accordingly 
these strategies include the development of several markets outside our traditional oilfield market 
these new markets include infrastructure construction applications  particularly for maintenance and upgrades of electric utility transmission lines in response to increasing demand for electricity in many parts of the country  and for other infrastructure 
table of contents construction applications and temporary roads for movement of oversized or unusually heavy loads 
we recently completed the acquisition of the third party ownership in our dura base mat manufacturing facility and restarted production at that facility in august we are now implementing several improvements to that product family based on our experience with rental and sales of this product 
we believe our new lightweight bravo mat system will substantially broaden the opportunities for mat sales 
this new mat system has been designed specifically for personnel applications  including temporary event surfaces  walkways  tent flooring and other applications 
we believe that the bravo system is rapidly gaining market acceptance 
e p waste disposal 
absent the impact of the major hurricanes in the third quarter of  we had experienced an increase in gulf coast market activity  principally associated with the inland barge market 
we believe that the damage from the recent hurricanes to the service infrastructure  docks and rig fleet in the gulf coast market will negatively impact e p waste disposal revenues until all available rigs and related service infrastructure are back in service in in early  we announced the formation of newpark environmental water solutions  llc news  through which we have started to commercialize in the united states and canada the armel activator technology  a proprietary and patented water treatment technology owned by a mexican company controlled by one family the mexican group 
this new technology employs principles of sonochemistry to remove dissolved solids from wastewater 
where necessary  the technology can be introduced into conventional treatment processes  rendering those processes much more effective and economical 
since  we have operated under a memorandum of understanding with the mexican group  which contemplates that we will enter into an exclusive license for the technology and purchase proprietary equipment and services from a company controlled by the mexican group and pay to the mexican group  or a company it controls  a royalty based on net income from use of the technology 
to date  although we are working and negotiating with the mexican group  this arrangement has not been finalized 
through december   we had invested million in property  plant and equipment and other assets related to this business 
during the first quarter of  news took delivery of its first water treatment system  which has been installed at our boulder  wyoming  facility  originally opened in while still in the start up and testing phase of our operating plan  we are producing treated water that meets the discharge requirements of our permit 
this facility will service customers in the jonah and pinedale fields 
as a result of favorable tests of this facility  we have accelerated plans to increase the plant s throughput capacity  and have initiated several additions to the original plant design aimed at raising output to as much as  barrels per day 
these developments should be fully in place by early news was also awarded its first contract for processing produced water from coal bed methane production near gillette  wyoming 
we recently completed a  barrel per day capacity facility at that location and testing of that facility is currently ongoing 
first revenues are expected from the facility in march in addition  two testing and demonstration plants have been transported to the canadian market and are expected to begin testing in march in the fort mcmurray oil sands market 
other market trends current long term industry analyses forecast difficulty in meeting anticipated growing demand for natural gas 
in addition  current gas reserves are being depleted at a rate faster than replacement through current drilling activities 
many shallow fields in the gulf coast market have 
table of contents been heavily exploited 
improved economics and technology have increased the interest of producers to drill at greater depths to reach the larger gas reserves 
this trend is limited by the availability of rigs of adequate capacity to reach these deeper objectives 
in other areas  including the mid continent and the rockies  deep shales and other hard rock formations of limited permeability are being exploited with advanced fracture stimulation technology that facilitates production of natural gas from these formations 
newpark provides drilling fluids systems that accelerate penetration of these formations  thus reducing total well cost 
we expect that increases in natural gas drilling activity will be increasingly associated with deeper  more costly wells 
we view this trend as favorable to demand for product offerings in all of our segments 
current short term industry forecasts suggest that we could see a slight increase in the number of rigs active in our primary gulf coast market  but this increase is expected to develop slowly as customers react to the changing risk profile of the market 
the number of rigs active in the offshore and inland water gulf coast markets is expected to increase slowly due to a lack of rigs of adequate capability 
in addition  a number of rigs were lost in the third quarter hurricanes 
we anticipate continued revenue growth in the markets we serve  driven by market share gains in critical  deep water and geologically deeper wells which generate higher levels of revenue per well 
this market penetration is the result of our performance and continued success of new products  including our deepdrill and flexdrill families of products

operating income operating income for this segment increased million in on a million increase in revenues  compared to the operating margin for this segment in was  
table of contents compared to in the increase in operating margin was principally attributable to recent price increases and the operating leverage of this segment 
the increase in operating margin was partially offset by increased barite costs that have not been fully recovered through price increases to our customers during more favorable transportation arrangements have helped to stabilize barite costs 
recent price increases should help recover the remainder of these cost increases 
mat and integrated services revenues total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs

this compares to million square feet at an average price of per square foot in our oilfield mat rental pricing should continue to increase as market conditions improve 
any further improvement in revenue will be contingent upon increased utilization of our mat inventory  related in part to reductions in available mat inventory  and to improvements in market activity 
re rental revenues increased by million in  compared to  reflecting an increase in the number of larger installations in revenues from non oilfield mat rentals  a premium margin market composed principally of seasonal utility and infrastructure construction markets  increased  or 
most of this increase occurred in the first quarter of third quarter market conditions were hampered by four hurricanes affecting the southeastern region of the united states 
however  we continue to believe that this market has growth opportunities due to increasing demand for electricity and the aging of our nation s electrical power delivery infrastructure 
canadian revenues for and were related to sales of wooden mats 
the increase in wooden mat sales is principally due to the unusually early break up in western canada and continued acceptance of matting systems in this market as a means to improve the operating efficiency for our customers 
the increase in sales primarily occurred in the first half of total composite mat sales increased for  as compared to the same period in recent increases in the number of bravo sales have helped to offset declines in the more expensive durabase mat sales 
during  we recognized approximately million in composite mat sales 
integrated services and other revenues  our lowest margin business unit for this segment  includes a comprehensive range of environmental services necessary for our customers oil and gas e p activities 
these revenues also include the operations of our sawmill in batson  texas

with the process changes in place  we are back to full capacity  except for our venice facility  which was severely impacted by hurricane katrina 
we expect to see an increase in waste volumes received in this market  once activity returns to pre storm levels 
the increase in gulf coast revenues was more than offset by lower revenues from the wyoming and western canadian market as resources and management focus were reallocated to development of the new water treatment business 
beginning in mid  we added additional management resources in the western canadian market and in the fourth quarter revenues and operating income began to improve

revenue recognition for the fluids sales and engineering segment  revenues  less allowances for product returns  are recognized for sales of drilling fluid materials upon shipment of the materials 
engineering and related services are provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates  and revenues are recognized when the services are performed 
for the e p waste disposal segment  revenues are recognized when we take title to the waste  which is upon receipt of the waste at our facility 
all costs related to the transporting and disposing of the waste received are accrued when that revenue is recognized 

table of contents for the mat and integrated services segment  revenues for sales of wooden or composite mats are recognized when title passes to the customer  which is upon shipment or delivery  depending upon the terms of the underlying sales contract 
revenues in the mat and integrated services segment are generated from both fixed price and unit priced contracts  which are short term in duration 
the activities under these contracts include site preparation  pit design  construction and drilling waste management  and installation and use of our composite or wooden mat systems during an initial period 
this initial period includes revenues and costs for site preparation  installation and use of mat systems 
revenues from these contracts are recorded using the percentage of completion method based on project milestones as specified in the contracts 
at the end of the initial period  the customer  at its option  may extend the use of the mat systems 
revenues related to the extension period are quoted either on a day rate basis or at a fixed price and are recognized ratably over the agreed extension period 
revenues for services provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates are recognized when the services are performed 
the services typically provided to our customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates include site assessment and regulatory compliance 
all reimbursements by customers of shipping and handling costs are included in revenues 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenues in the income statement 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and notes receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
for notes receivable  our judgments with respect to collectibility includes evaluating any underlying collateral 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
since amounts due from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to the allowance can be material 
inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on fair value of the inventory using factors such as our historical usage of inventory on hand  future expectations related to our customers needs  market conditions and the development of new products 
we have recently developed several new products  including our deepdrill family of products and our dura base tm and bravo tm composite plastic mat systems 
our inability to obtain market acceptance of these products  changes in oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
impairments our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goowill and other intangible assets  net of amortization  totalling approximately million 
this amount has principally been recorded as a result of business combinations 
in addition  our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  of approximately million 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  
table of contents intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
we perform goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on at least an annual basis in accordance with the guidance in financial accounting standard fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests 
these tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets 
with respect to goodwill  as required by fas  we compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts  including goodwill 
under fas  fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
our methods for estimating reporting unit fair values include discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings 
we typically identify our reporting units based on geographic markets within each of our business segments 
we perform property  plant and equipment and other long lived asset impairment tests in accordance with fas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a future cash flow concept 
we assess the impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the market value of assets  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based on one or more of the above indicators  any impairment is calculated in accordance with fas and fas and recorded as an impairment loss 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets of million at december  we provide for deferred taxes in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
under fas  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had recorded a valuation allowance for all state nols and for nols generated during start up operations of our mexican joint venture 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period this determination was made 

table of contents new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas revised  share based payment  fas r which is a revision of fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
fas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas however  fas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted fas r effective january  fas r permits adoption of its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirement of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fas for all awards granted prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method previously described  but also permits restatement of prior periods based on the amounts previously reported in pro forma disclosures under fas we currently plan to adopt fas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by fas  through december   we have accounted for stock based compensation using accounting principles board apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r will likely have a material impact on our results of operations 
however  the ultimate impact of adoption of fas r cannot be predicted because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note a to our consolidated financial statements under the heading stock based compensation 
in november  the fasb issued fas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
it requires that these items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet a criterion of so abnormal 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we adopted fas effective january  we do not expect adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
we do not believe that we have a material exposure to market risk 
historically  we have not regularly entered into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk or for speculative purposes 
however  during the quarter ended march   we did enter into a foreign currency forward contract arrangement 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk our policy has historically been to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had total debt outstanding of million  of which million  or  is our senior subordinated notes the notes  which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
the remaining million of debt outstanding at december  bears interest at a floating rate 
at december   the weighted average interest rate under our floating rate debt was approximately 
a basis point increase in market interest rates during would cause our annual interest expense to increase 
table of contents approximately million  net of taxes  resulting in a per diluted share reduction in annual earnings 
the notes mature on december  there are no scheduled principal payments under the notes prior to the maturity date 
however  all or some of the notes may be redeemed at a premium after december  we have no current plans to repay the notes ahead of their scheduled maturity 
foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in canada and in areas surrounding the mediterranean sea 
we have foreign currency exchange risks associated with these operations  which are principally conducted in the functional currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we have entered into transactions denominated in a currency other than our local currencies  because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments 
however  during the quarter ended march   our canadian subsidiary committed to purchase approximately million of barite from one of our us subsidiaries and entered into a foreign currency forward contract arrangement to reduce its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to this commitment 
the forward contract requires that the canadian subsidiary purchase approximately million us dollars at a contracted exchange rate of over a two year period 
at december   the fair value of this forward contract represents a loss of approximately during the years ended december   and  we reported foreign currency gains of   and  respectively 
these transactional gains were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  including intercompany advances which were deemed to be short term in nature 
we estimate that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates would affect annual earnings by approximately  due to the revaluing of these monetary assets and intercompany balances 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet 
our comprehensive income includes translation gains losses of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   net assets of foreign subsidiaries included in our consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
we estimate that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates would affect other comprehensive income by approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of cash and cash equivalents  net accounts receivable  accounts payable and variable rate debt approximated book value at december  the fair value of the notes totaled million at december  the fair value of the notes has been estimated based on quotes from the lead broker
