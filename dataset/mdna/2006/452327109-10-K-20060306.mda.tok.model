overview we were incorporated in april we develop and market next generation tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine  a key goal of genomics 
using our technologies  we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the performance  throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics 
this information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states  enhancing drug discovery  allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically  and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients 

table of contents in  we began commercial sale of short pieces of dna called oligonucleotides  which we refer to as oligos  manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology 
we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies  and this advantage enabled us to market our oligos under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins 
in  we commercialized the first implementation of our beadarray technology  the sentrix array matrix 
this is a disposable matrix with fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard well microtiter plate 
each fiber optic bundle performs more than  unique assays  which enables researchers to perform focused genotyping experiments in a high throughput format 
this format was also used to initiate our single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping services product line 
as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput  low cost beadarray technology  we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many leading genotyping centers  and were awarded million from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the first phase of the international hapmap project 
our production scale beadlab is a turnkey platform that includes all hardware and software necessary to enable researchers to perform genetic analysis research on what we believe is an unprecedented scale 
this system is being marketed to a small number of high throughput genotyping users 
as of january   we have installed and recorded revenue for beadlabs 
in  we announced the launch of several new products  including a new array format  the sentrix beadchip  which significantly expands market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provides increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers  a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that allows researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to samples on a single array  and a benchtop snp genotyping and gene expression system  the beadstation  for performing moderate scale genotyping and gene expression using our technology 
the beadstation includes our beadarray reader  analysis software and assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs 
sales of these products began in the first quarter of and  as of january   we have shipped beadstations 
in late  we announced a strategic collaboration with invitrogen corporation invitrogen to synthesize and distribute oligos 
in the third quarter of  we began shipping oligo products in connection with this agreement 
as part of the agreement  we have developed the next generation of our oligator dna synthesis technology  which we have designed to support both plate and tube based capabilities 
invitrogen is responsible for sales  marketing and technical support 
profits from sales of collaboration products are divided equally between the two companies 
in  we began shipments of sentrix beadchips for whole genome gene expression and whole genome genotyping 
the whole genome gene expression beadchips are designed to enable high performance  cost effective  whole genome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip  resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of whole genome expression analysis 
our whole genome expression product line includes multi sample products for both the human and mouse genomes 
the whole genome genotyping beadchip is designed to scale to high levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and to provide scientists the ability to query hundreds of thousands of snps in parallel 
in the second quarter of  we commenced shipment of our first whole genome genotyping beadchip  the humanhap  which interrogates more than  snps in parallel 

table of contents in april  we completed the acquisition of cyvera corporation  a privately held connecticut based company  pursuant to which cyvera became a wholly owned subsidiary of illumina 
we believe that cyvera s digital microbead platform will be highly complementary to our portfolio of products and services 
the acquisition is expected to provide us with a comprehensive approach to bead based assays for biomarker research and development and in vitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities  including those that require low complexity as well as high complexity testing 
we expect the first products based on cyvera s technology to be available in the second half of the purchase price associated with the transaction was approximately million 
we allocated million of this purchase price to acquired in process research and development and charged such amount against earnings in the second quarter of in january  we began shipment of the new sentrix humanhap genotyping beadchip to customers around the world 
using the infinium assay  which enables us to select virtually any snp in the genome  the humanhap beadchip offers genomic coverage for more than  snps 
we selected the snp assays in collaboration with a consortium of scientists that are leaders in the genotyping field 
we believe this product has quality and performance features that support our expectation that it will become an important discovery tool for researchers seeking to understand the genetic basis of common  yet complex diseases 
our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high value products and service projects  the impact of seasonal spending patterns  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform  changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry  the timing and amount of government grant funding programs and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns 
any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products  unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines  or impacts from the other factors mentioned above  could adversely affect our revenue growth in or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss  we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
as of january   our accumulated deficit was million  and total stockholders equity was million 
these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research  development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services  an acquired in process research and development charge of million related to our acquisition of cyvera and a charge of million related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research  development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years 
we will also need to significantly increase our selling  general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems  other products and services 
as a result of the expected increase in expenses  we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve sustained profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates  assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical if they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue consists of sales of arrays  reagents  instrumentation  and oligos 
service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services  extended warranty sales and revenue earned from milestone payments 
as described below  significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under sab no 
 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer  provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned  which is generally upon shipment 
however  in the case of beadlabs  revenue is recognized upon the completion of installation  training and the receipt of customer acceptance 
revenue for genotyping services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer or as specific milestones are achieved 
in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable  we ensure there are no refund rights 
if payment terms are based on future performance  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
changes in judgments and estimates made in determining whether the criteria of sab no 
have been met might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 
sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one year warranty 
we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts  which are generally for one or two years  upon the expiration of the initial warranty 
revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period 
reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates  our gross margins could be adversely affected 

table of contents while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
some of our agreements contain multiple elements that include milestone payments 
revenue from a milestone achievement is recognized when earned  as evidenced by acknowledgement from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  iii the milestone payment is non refundable and iv the performance obligations for both us and our collaborators after the milestone achievement will continue at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
if all of these criteria are not met  the milestone achievement is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
we defer non refundable upfront fees received under our collaborations and recognize them over the period the related services are provided or over the estimated collaboration term using various factors specific to the collaboration 
advance payments we receive in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
a third source of revenue  research revenue  consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues  historical experience and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 

table of contents contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
currently  we have no such liabilities recorded 
this may change in the future depending upon new developments in each matter 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different acceptable generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily use the discounted cash flow method 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
during  we adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
as of january   we had million of goodwill 
this goodwill is reported as a separate line item in the balance sheet for fiscal 
table of contents recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supercedes accounting principles bulletin apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements for sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but companies may restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
we currently utilize the black scholes model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees under the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
while sfas no 
r permits companies to continue to use such model  it also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have deterimined we will use the black scholes model to measure the fair value of employee stock options under sfas no 
r 
the new standard is effective for companies that are not small business issuers  like us  beginning with the first reporting period during the first fiscal year beginning on or after june   and we adopted sfas no 
r at the beginning of our new reporting period on january  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method is expected to result in significant non cash charges which will increase our reported operating expenses 
however  it will have no impact on our cash flows 
the precise impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  we believe the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 on a prospective basis  as of january  sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
requires that those items if abnormal be recognized as expenses in the period incurred 
in addition  sfas no 
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversions based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended january   january   and december  stated as a percentage of total revenue

revenue year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue research revenue total revenue total revenue for the years ended january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
this represents an increase of million for  or  as compared to 
table of contents product revenue increased to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in was primarily due to higher beadstation  consumable and  to a lesser extent  oligo sales 
growth in consumable sales was due to the launch of several new products  as well as the growth in our installed base of beadstations 
as of january   we have shipped a total of beadstations and beadlabs 
service and other revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to higher demand for third party snp genotyping service contracts during the period 
in addition  due to the achievement of a milestone associated with our collaboration agreement with invitrogen  we recognized revenue of million in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by decreased revenue related to the international hapmap project 
we completed all revenue generating genotyping services for the international hapmap project early in the first quarter of we expect sales from third party snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis  depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed 
the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us 
government grants and other research funding decreased to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january   due primarily to a decrease in internal research spending for our grants from the national institutes of health 
we expect revenue from government grants to decline in the future as we continue to expand our focus on commercial operations 
cost of product and service and other revenue year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service and other revenue total cost of product and service and other revenue cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  installation  warranty  packaging and delivery costs  as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers 
costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of product and service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  due primarily to the significant increase in product revenue 
gross margin on product and service and other revenue was for  as compared to for 
table of contents cost of product revenue increased to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january   due to the significant increase in product revenue 
gross margin on product revenue decreased to for the year ended january   as compared to for the year ended january  the decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of product mix 
a higher percentage of our revenue in was generated from the sale of instrumentation  which generally has a lower gross margin than other products 
other factors contributing to the decrease include decreased gross margins related to our consumable and oligo sales 
lower consumable margins can be primarily attributed to lower average selling prices on consumable sales in  as compared to  which were partially offset by decreased manufacturing costs 
in addition  the gross margin associated with oligo products sold as a part of the invitrogen collaboration was lower when compared to the prior year 
the change in oligo gross margin is due to the fact that  under the invitrogen collaboration  we no longer sell oligos directly 
as a result  the gross margin related to this product line decreased  however  the net margin has increased due to the fact that most of the sales and marketing expenses surrounding the oligo business have shifted to our collaboration partner  invitrogen 
cost of service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to for the year ended january  from in the year ended january  the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects and decreased average selling prices 
we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins 
however  we expect our market to become increasingly price competitive and our margins may fluctuate 
research and development expenses year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the development expenses incurred to develop our newly acquired microbead technology purchased in conjunction with our acquisition of cyvera in april research and development expenses related to the microbead technology totaled approximately million in additional factors contributing to the increased research and development expenses during relate to increased costs of million associated with the cost of beadarray research activities and million related to research costs to support our oligator technology platform 
we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we expand our product base 
stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was approximately million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing  finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  our sales and marketing expenses increased million  of which million was attributable to personnel related expenses for the build out of our sales force and customer support staff  and million is attributable to other non personnel related costs  including sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million in  as compared to  due primarily to a million decrease in litigation expenses  partially offset by a million increase in personnel related expenses 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to accelerate as we expand our staff  add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur increased litigation costs and additional costs to support the commercialization and support of an increasing number of products 
stock based compensation for selling  general and administrative employees  directors and consultants was million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  during  we recorded non cash compensation expense for accelerated vesting of options for certain employees totaling approximately million 
this compensation was provided as incentive to continue to work as key members of the sales team associated with the invitrogen collaboration 
acquired in process research and development year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands acquired in process research and development  n a during the year ended january   we recorded million of acquired ipr d resulting from the cyvera acquisition 
these amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
at the acquisition date  cyvera s ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily the development of its microbead technology platform and optical instrumentation reader concepts 
the ipr d charge related to the cyvera acquisition was made up of two projects that were approximately and complete at the date of acquisition 
the discount rate applied to calculate the ipr d charge was 
acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future may result in substantial charges for acquired ipr d that may cause fluctuations in our interim or annual operating results 
there were no charges resulting from any acquisitions during the same period in 
table of contents amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges since our inception  in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees  founders and directors through july   we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling approximately million  representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated by our management for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or restricted common stock was sold 
deferred compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the options and restricted stock 
in  we recorded million as deferred compensation related to unvested options associated with our acquisition of cyvera 
in addition  in  we granted a restricted stock award to an employee and recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million 
during the years ended january  and january   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately million and million  respectively 
we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees  founders and directors  using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
for consultants  deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with sfas no 
and is periodically re measured and expensed in accordance with eitf no 
in  we recorded approximately  as deferred compensation expense related to our acquisition of cyvera 
we also recorded non cash compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of options for certain employees totaling approximately million 
this compensation was provided to these employees as incentive to continue to work as key members of the sales team associated with the invitrogen collaboration 
in addition  in we granted a restricted stock award to an employee and recorded a non cash compensation charge of  we expect expenses related to stock based compensation to increase significantly beginning in as we implement the requirements of sfas no 
r 
although the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method is expected to result in a significant increase in our reported operating expenses  it will have no impact on our cash flows 
sfas no 
r is discussed further in recently issued accounting standards in item and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
litigation judgment settlement  net year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands litigation judgment settlement  net 
table of contents we recorded a million charge in june to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a jury verdict in a termination of employment lawsuit 
we appealed the decision  and in december  the fourth appellate district court of appeal  in san diego  california  reduced the amount of the award 
during the appeal process  the court required us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case was resolved 
during the years ended january  and december   we recorded million and million  respectively  of such interest charges as litigation expense 
as a result of the revised judgment  we reduced the million liability on our balance sheet to million and recorded a gain of million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter of in addition  in august  we recorded a million gain as a result of a settlement with applera 
interest income year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher effective interest rates compared to the prior year 
interest and other expense year ended year ended january  january  percentage change in thousands interest and other expense interest and other expense consists of interest expense  expenses related to foreign exchange transaction costs  foreign income taxes and gains and losses on disposals of assets 
interest and other expense decreased to million for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  interest expense was  for the year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january  interest expense in the period relates primarily to a million fixed rate loan that was paid off in august in connection with the sale of our san diego facilities 
in the year ended january   we recorded approximately million in losses due to foreign currency transactions compared to million in foreign currency transaction losses for the year ended january  estimated foreign income taxes were approximately million and million for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
in addition in  we recorded million related to losses on disposal of assets 
there were no gains or losses on disposals in provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended january  and january  and  accordingly  we did not pay any us federal or state income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
as of january   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 

table of contents as of january   we also had us federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in and the california carryforwards have no expiration 
our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  and similar state provisions  as a result of changes in our ownership structure 
cyvera corporation had an ownership change upon our acquisition during and  accordingly  its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitation 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
we are in the final stages of completing our formal section and analysis and it is anticipated that approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited

revenue year ended year ended january  december  percentage change in thousands product revenue service revenue research revenue total revenue revenue for the years ended january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
product revenue increased to million in from million in the increase resulted almost entirely from sales of consumables used on our beadlabs and beadstations and sales of our benchtop beadstations  offset by fewer sales of our production scale beadlabs

the accounts receivable and inventory increases over the prior year are primarily due to our significant year over year sales growth of  which resulted from increased customer demand and our introduction of new products and services into the market 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liability balances was driven primarily by increases in general business activity associated with such sales growth  as well as expenses associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure to accommodate this growth

under the terms of the bond  we were required to maintain a letter of credit for of the bond amount to secure the bond 
further  we were required to deposit approximately million of marketable securities as collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly  these funds were restricted from use for corporate purposes 
a judgment was rendered in december and a million payment was made in early  at which time the restricted funds were released 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  revenue from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs  barring unforeseen developments 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping and gene expression systems and extensions to those products and to expand our oligos and snp genotyping services product lines  scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with affymetrix  the success of our collaboration with invitrogen and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 
therefore  we may require additional funding in the future 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations  such as an acquisition  even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights and any debt financing may carry covenants that could restrict our operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars  some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies 
accordingly  the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in operations 
in july  we began hedging significant foreign currency firm sales commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our forward exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly  to the extent effective  any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge transaction 
the notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at january  and january  were million and million  respectively 
as of january   we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding 
this contract had a fair value of  representing an unrealized gain  and was included in other current assets at january  this contract is set to expire in march and is with a reputable bank institution 
as of january   the outstanding contracts had a fair value of million  representing an unrealized loss  and were included in other current liabilities at january  we settled foreign exchange contracts of million and million for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
our hedging program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we believe we have hedged all significant firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies  and as a result  any increase or decrease in the exchange rates of these commitments would have no material net effect to our balance sheet or our results of operations 
the company did not hold any derivative financial instruments prior to fiscal
