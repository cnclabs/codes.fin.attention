item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the reader s attention is directed to those paragraphs and item a 
risk factors for discussion of various risks and uncertainties that may affect our future 
market risk sensitive instruments and risk management our financial instruments  commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices as described below 
commodity price risk is present in our electric operations  gas and oil production and procurement operations  and energy marketing and trading operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for natural gas  oil  electricity and other commodities 
we use derivative commodity contracts to manage price risk exposures for these operations 
interest rate risk is generally related to our outstanding debt 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks related to our purchase of fuel services denominated in a foreign currency 
in addition  we are exposed to equity price risk through various portfolios of equity securities 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we performed an evaluation of our clearinghouse trading and marketing operations  which resulted in a decision to exit certain trading activities and instead focus on the optimization of company assets 
in connection with the reorganization  certain commodity derivative contracts previously designated as held for trading purposes are now held for non trading purposes 
the following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time period due to a unfavorable change in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity price risk as part of our strategy to market energy and to manage related risks  we hold commodity based financial derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we also manage price risk associated with purchases and sales of natural gas  oil  electricity and certain other commodities using commodity based financial derivative instruments held for non trading purposes 
the derivatives used to manage risk are executed within established policies and procedures and include instruments such as futures  forwards  swaps and options that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices 
for sensitivity analysis purposes  the fair value of commodity based financial derivative instruments is determined based on models that consider the market prices of commodities in future periods  the volatility of the market prices in each period  as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments 
prices and volatility are principally determined based on actively quoted market prices 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million and million in the fair value of our commodity based financial derivative instruments held for trading purposes as of december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in market prices of our non trading commodity based financial derivative instruments would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our non trading commodity based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when such contracts are ultimately settled 
net losses from derivative commodity instruments used for hedging purposes  to the extent realized  will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction  such as revenue from sales 
interest rate risk we manage our interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt 
we also enter into interest rate sensitive derivatives  including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements 
for financial instruments outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would decrease annual earnings by approximately million 
a hypothetical increase in market interest rates  as determined at december   would have resulted in a decrease in annual earnings of approximately million 
in addition  we retain ownership of mortgage investments  including subordinated bonds and interest only residual assets retained from securitizations of mortgage loans originated and purchased in prior years 
note to our consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of changes in value of these investments 
foreign currency exchange risk our canadian natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are relatively self contained within canada 
as a result  our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk for these activities is limited primarily to the effects of translation adjustments that arise from including that operation in our consolidated financial state

we monitor this exposure and believe it is not material 
in addition  we manage our foreign exchange risk exposure associated with anticipated future purchases of nuclear fuel processing services denominated in foreign currencies by utilizing currency forward contracts 
as a result of holding these contracts as hedges  our exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in relevant foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million and million in the fair value of currency forward contracts held at december  and  respectively 
investment price risk we are subject to investment price risk due to marketable securities held as investments in decommissioning trust funds 
these marketable securities are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
we recognized net realized gains net of investment income on nuclear decommissioning trust investments of million in and million in we recorded  in aoci  net unrealized gains on decommissioning trust investments of million and million in and  respectively 
we also sponsor employee pension and other postretirement benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund benefit payments 
to the extent that the values of investments held in these trusts decline  the effect will be reflected in our recognition of the periodic cost of such employee benefit plans and the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans 
our pension plans experienced net realized and unrealized gains of million and million in and  respectively 
risk management policies we have operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to help ensure that proper internal controls are maintained 
in addition  we have established an independent function at the corporate level to monitor compliance with the risk management policies of all subsidiaries 
we maintain credit policies that include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty s financial condition  collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
in addition  we also monitor the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
based on our credit policies and the december  provision for credit losses  management believes that it is unlikely that a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would occur as a result of counterparty nonperformance
