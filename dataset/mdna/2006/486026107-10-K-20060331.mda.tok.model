item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview for purposes of this discussion and analysis section  reference is made to the table below and the company s consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item we have two principal operating groups maintenance products and electrical products 
the group labeled as other consists of sahlman and sesco 
one business unit formerly included in the electrical products group  gc waldom and one business formerly included in the maintenance products group  duckback  have been classified as discontinued operations for the periods prior to their sale 
duckback was sold on september  and gc waldom was sold on april  since the recapitalization  the company s management has been focused on the following restructuring and cost reduction initiatives consolidation of facilities manufacturing  distribution and office facilities closed or consolidated including to be closed during  manufacture and distribution of each business unit centralized  electrical products manufacturing outsourced to asia 
divestitures of non core operations non core business units have been sold or otherwise exited and proceeds have been applied to reduce debt 
selling general and administrative sg a cost rationalization restructured duplicative corporate and support functions  overhead reduced  implemented shared sales  administrative and support services model 
organizational changes across the board review of management talent and key hires made at both the corporate and operational levels 
with these initiatives nearly complete  the company s focus has shifted to sustaining revenue growth and containing raw material costs 
our future cost reductions are expected to continue to come from process improvements such as lean manufacturing and six sigma  value engineering products  improved sourcing purchasing and lean administration 
end user demand for our maintenance and electrical products is relatively stable and recurring 
demand for products in our markets is strong and supported by the necessity of the products to users  creating a steady and predictable market 
in the core janitorial sanitary and foodservice segments  sanitary and health standards create a steady flow of ongoing demand 
the consumable or short life nature of most of the products used for cleaning applications primarily floor pads  hand pads  and mops  brooms and brushes means that they are replaced frequently  creating further demand stability 
however  we continue to see a trend of just in time inventory being maintained by our distributors 
this has resulted in smaller  more frequent orders coming from our distribution base 
the unstable resin market has created a need to increase prices to commercial customers  and to date  they have been accepted 
but  commercial customers now believe resin prices are coming down and future increases may be difficult to implement 
in addition  many of our electrical products can be characterized as value items that are frequently lost or discarded  with subsequent replacement ensuring continuing and stable demand 
this is particularly the case with electrical cords  which consistently experience strong sales ahead of the holiday season 
certain of the markets in which we compete are expected to experience steady growth over the next several years 
our core commercial cleaning product markets are expected to grow at rates approximating gross domestic product gdp  driven by increasing sanitary standards as a result of heightened health concerns 
in addition  the improvement in general economic conditions will increase demand for katy s cleaning products  due to higher commercial occupancy rate  increased demand for travel and hospitality industries and a renewed concern with environmentally friendly products to be used in the cleaning process or the collection of contaminants 
the consumer plastics market as a whole is relatively mature  with its growth characteristics linked to household expenditures 
demand is driven by the increasing acquisition of material possessions by north american households and the desire of consumers to store those possessions in an attractive and orderly manner 
demand for consumer plastic storage products is closely linked to value items and the ability to pass resin increases has been a significant challenge 
the market for automotive storage units  is driven by sales of trucks  sports utility vehicles suv s and cross utility vehicles cuv s which is declining due to the high cost of gasoline 
end users are sensitive to the price value relationship more than brand name and are seeking alternative solutions when the price value relationship does not meet their expectations 
we estimate that the north american market for cords and work lights will grow at above gdp growth rates  driven by the growing number of suburban homes particularly those with outdoor spaces and the growth in the use of outdoor appliances 
the market for surge protectors and multiple outlet products is also expected to grow at above gdp growth rates driven by the continued use in consumer purchasers of appliances  computers  home entertainment equipment  and other electronic equipment  as well as the growing public awareness of the need to protect these products from power surges 

table of contents key elements in achieving profitability in the maintenance products group include maintaining a low cost structure  from a production  distribution and administrative standpoint  providing outstanding customer service and containing raw material costs especially plastic resins or raising prices to shift these higher costs to our customers for our plastic products 
in addition to continually striving to reduce our cost structure  we are seeking to offset pricing challenges by developing new products  as new products or beneficial modifications of existing products increase demand from our customers  provide novelty to the consumer  and offer an opportunity for favorable pricing from customers 
retention of customers  or more specifically  product lines with those customers  is also very important in the mass merchant retail area  given the vast size of these national accounts 
since the fourth quarter of  we centralized our customer service and administrative functions for ccp divisions continental  glit  wilen  and disco in one location  allowing customers to order products from any ccp commercial unit on one purchase order 
we believe that operating these business units as a cohesive unit will improve customer service in that our customers purchasing processes will be simplified  as will follow up on order status  billing  collection and other related functions 
we believe that this may increase customer loyalty  help in attracting new customers and lead to increased top line sales in future years 
key elements in achieving profitability in the electrical products group are in many ways similar to those mentioned for our maintenance products group 
the achievement and maintenance of a low cost structure is critical given the significant level of foreign competition  primarily from asia and latin america 
for this reason  woods us and woods canada  respectively  executes a fully outsourced strategy for their consumer electrical products 
customer service  specifically the ability to fill orders at a rate designated by our customers  is very important to customer retention  given seasonal sales pressures in the consumer electrical area 
woods us and woods canada are both subject to seasonal sales trends in connection with the holiday shopping season  with stronger sales and profits realized in the third and early fourth quarters 
retention of customers is critical in the electrical products group  given the size of national accounts 
see outlook for in this section for discussion of recent developments related to the maintenance products group and the electrical products group

other upon review of sahlman s results for and the first half of  and after initial study of the status of the shrimp industry and markets in the united states  we evaluated the business further to determine if there had been a loss in the value of the investment that was other than temporary 
we estimated the fair value of the sahlman business through a liquidation value analysis whereby all of sahlman s assets would be sold and all of its obligations would be settled with the assistance of a third party appraisal 
also based on the aforementioned appraisal  we evaluated the business by using various discounted cash flow analyses  estimating future free cash flows of the business with different assumptions regarding growth  and reducing the value of the business arrived at through this analysis by its outstanding debt 
all values were then multiplied by  katy s investment percentage 
the answers derived by each of the three assumption models were then probability weighted 
as a result  katy concluded that million was a reasonable estimate of the value of its investment in sahlman  and therefore a charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of to reduce the carrying value of the investment 
in  the company did not recognize any equity income given no income was present at sahlman 
interest expense decreased by million in versus  primarily due to the write off of unamortized debt costs of million in resulting from a february refinancing and other reductions in overall availability 
the remaining decrease in interest expense of million was due mainly to slightly lower average borrowings during  principally as a result of applying the proceeds from the sale of non core businesses in to repay debt

during the year ended december   a tax benefit of million was recorded on pre tax loss to the extent a provision was provided for the gain on sale of discontinued businesses and income from operations of discontinued businesses 
a further benefit was not recorded due to the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
also in  million and million of income tax expense were attributable to income from discontinued businesses and the gain on the sale of discontinued businesses  respectively 
discontinued operations the gc waldom and duckback business units are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended december  there was no discontinued operations activity for gc waldom reported income of million net of tax in the first half of we sold gc waldom on april  and recognized a loss net of tax of million in the second quarter of as a result of the sale 
duckback generated income of million net of tax in the first nine months of we sold duckback on september  and recognized a gain net of tax of million in the third quarter of as a result of the sale 
liquidity and capital resources we require funding for working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and the use of available borrowings under the bank of america credit agreement as defined below provide sufficient liquidity for our operations going forward 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million versus cash and cash equivalents of million at december  also as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million 
of total capitalization  under the bank of america credit agreement with unused borrowing availability on the revolving credit facility of million 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million 
of total capitalization 
we provided cash flow from operations of million during the year ended december  versus the million used in operations during the year ended december  the company improved its cash flow from operations as a result of reducing accounts receivable and inventory along with the management of accounts payable levels 
we expect these liquidity trends to continue in as capital expenditures are expected to be comparable in  and working capital is expected to be stable 
we have a number of obligations and commitments  which are listed on the schedule later in this section entitled contractual and commercial obligations 
we have considered all of these obligations and commitments in structuring our capital resources to ensure that they can be met 
see the notes accompanying the table in that section for further discussions of those items 
we believe that given our strong working capital base  additional liquidity could be obtained through additional debt financing  if necessary 
however  there is no guarantee that such financing could be obtained 
in addition  we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to the sale of excess assets and divestitures of certain of our business units 
asset sales and business divestitures present opportunities to provide additional liquidity by de leveraging our financial position 
bank of america credit agreement on april   we completed a refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness the refinancing and entered into a new agreement with bank of america business capital formerly fleet capital corporation the bank of america credit agreement 
like the previous credit agreement with fleet capital corporation  the bank of america credit agreement is a million facility with a million term loan term loan and a million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility with essentially the same terms as the previous credit agreement 
the bank of america credit agreement is an asset based lending agreement and involves a syndicate of four banks  all of which participated in the syndicate from the previous credit agreement 
since the inception of the previous credit agreement  we had repaid million of the previous term loan 
the ability to repay that loan on a faster than anticipated timetable was primarily due to funds generated by the sale of gc waldom in april  the sale of duckback in september and various sales of excess real estate 
the bank of america credit agreement  and the additional borrowing ability under the revolving credit facility obtained by incurring new term debt  results in three important benefits related to our long term strategy additional borrowing capacity to invest in capital expenditures and or acquisitions key to our strategic direction  increased working capital flexibility to build inventory 
table of contents when necessary to accommodate lower cost outsourced finished goods inventory and the ability to borrow locally in canada and the united kingdom and provide a natural hedge against currency fluctuations 
below is a summary of the sources and uses associated with the funding of the bank of america credit agreement in thousands sources term loan incremental borrowings uses repayment of revolving credit facility borrowings certain costs associated with the bank of america credit agreement the revolving credit facility has an expiration date of april  and its borrowing base is determined by eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the term loan also has a final maturity date of april  with quarterly payments of million 
a final payment of million is scheduled to be paid in april the term loan is collateralized by our property  plant and equipment 
our borrowing base under the bank of america credit agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of standby and commercial letters of credit 
vendors  financial institutions and other parties with whom we conduct business may require letters of credit in the future that either do not exist today or would be at higher amounts than those that exist today 
currently  our largest letters of credit relate to our casualty insurance programs 
at december   total outstanding letters of credit were million 
all extensions of credit under the bank of america credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in and lien upon the capital stock of each material domestic subsidiary of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries  and all of our present and future assets and properties 
customary financial covenants and restrictions apply under the bank of america credit agreement 
until september   interest accrued on the revolving credit facility borrowings at basis points over applicable libor rate and at basis points over libor for borrowings under the term loan 
in accordance with the bank of america credit agreement  our margins ie the interest rate spread above libor increased by basis points in the fourth quarter of based upon certain leverage measurements 
margins increased an additional basis points in the first quarter of based on our leverage ratio as defined in the bank of america credit agreement as of december  and will increase another basis points upon the effective date of the third amendment see below 
also in accordance with the bank of america credit agreement  margins on the term borrowings will drop basis points if the balance of the term loan is reduced below million 
interest accrues at higher margins on prime rates for swing loans  the amounts of which were nominal at december  at december   we determined that due to declining profitability in the fourth quarter of  potentially lower profitability in the first half of and the timing of certain restructuring payments  we would not meet our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the bank of america credit agreement and could potentially exceed our maximum consolidated leverage ratio also as defined in the bank of america credit agreement as of the end of the first  second and third quarters of in anticipation of not achieving the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or exceeding the maximum consolidated leverage ratio  we obtained an amendment to the bank of america credit agreement the second amendment 
the second amendment applied only to the first three quarters of and the covenants would have returned to their original levels for the fourth quarter of specifically  the second amendment eliminated the fixed charge coverage ratio  increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio  established a minimum consolidated ebitda on a latest twelve months basis for each of the periods and also established a minimum availability the eligible collateral base less outstanding borrowings and letters of credit on each day within the nine month period 
subsequent to the second amendment s effective date  we determined that we would likely not meet these amended financial covenants 
on april   we obtained a further amendment to the bank of america credit agreement the third amendment 
the third amendment eliminated the maximum consolidated leverage ratio and the minimum consolidated ebitda as established by the second amendment and adjusted the minimum availability such that our eligible collateral must exceed the sum of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility by at least million from the effective date of the third amendment through september  and by at least million from september  until the date we deliver our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
subsequent to the delivery of the financial statements for the first quarter of  the third amendment reestablished the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as originally set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
the third amendment also reduced the maximum allowable capital expenditures for from million to million  and increased the interest rate margins on all of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit to the largest margins set forth in the bank of america credit 
table of contents agreement 
interest rate margins would have returned to levels set forth in the bank of america credit agreement subsequent to the delivery of our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
during  the company obtained two additional amendments to the bank of america credit agreement 
the fourth amendment allowed the company to finance its insurance premium to a certain level whereas the fifth amendment allowed the acquisition of assets and assumption of certain liabilities of washington international non wovens  llc 
we were in compliance with the above financial covenants in the bank of america credit agreement  as amended above  at december  due to the performance levels within our maintenance group  we would not meet our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the amended bank of america credit agreement during in anticipation of not achieving the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  we obtained an amendment to the bank of america credit agreement the sixth amendment on march  as a result of the sixth amendment  the company s current debt covenants under the bank of america credit agreement are as follows minimum availability eligible collateral must exceed the sum of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility by at least million from the effective date of the sixth amendment through september  and by at least million from september  until the date we deliver our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
fixed charge coverage ratio the company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the bank of america credit agreement of pursuant to the sixth amendment  this covenant was suspended and will be reinstated following the first quarter of capital expenditures for the year ended december   the company is not to exceed million in capital expenditures 
subsequent to  the company is not to exceed million during a single fiscal year 
leverage ratio the third amendment to the bank of america credit agreement eliminated the leverage ratio as defined in the bank of america credit agreement as a financial covenant 
following the first quarter of  the leverage ratio will be utilized to determine the interest rate margin over the applicable libor rate 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of the amended covenants  we could seek to obtain further amendments and pursue increased liquidity through additional debt financing and or the sale of assets see discussion above 
however  the company believes that we will be able to comply with all covenants  as amended  throughout we incurred additional debt issuance costs in associated with the bank of america credit agreement 
additionally  at the time of the inception of the bank of america credit agreement  we had approximately million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the previous credit agreement 
the remainder of the previously capitalized costs  along with the capitalized costs from the bank of america credit agreement  will be amortized over the life of the bank of america credit agreement through april based on the pro rata reduction in borrowing capacity from a previous refinancing of the company s credit facility and in the connection with the sale of assets primarily the gc waldom and duckback businesses to repay the term loan under the previous agreement  we charged to expense million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs during also  during the first quarter of  we incurred fees and expenses of million associated with a financing which we chose not to pursue 
in  the company had the amortization of debt issuance costs of million 
in addition  the company incurred million associated with amending the bank of america credit agreement  as discussed above 
the revolving credit facility under the bank of america credit agreement requires lockbox agreements which provide for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding 
these agreements  combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the bank of america credit agreement  caused the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability  per guidance in the emerging issues task force issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
we do not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the mae clause  which is a fairly typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lenders to require the loan to become due if they determine there has been a material adverse effect on our operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition  or prospects 
the classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the lockbox agreements and mae clause 
the bank of america credit agreement does not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather has a final expiration date of april  the lender had not notified us of any indication of a mae at december   and we were not in default of any provision of the bank of america credit agreement at december

severance  restructuring and related charges over the past three years  the company has initiated several cost reduction and facility consolidation initiatives  resulting in severance  restructuring and related charges 
key initiatives were the consolidation of the st 
louis manufacturing distribution facilities  shutdown of both woods us and woods canada manufacturing as well as the consolidation of the glit facilities 
these initiatives resulted from the on going strategic reassessment of our various businesses as well as the markets in which they operate

katy expects to substantially complete its restructuring program in the remaining severance  restructuring and related costs for these initiatives are expected to be approximately million 
since  the company has been focused on a number of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives  resulting in severance  restructuring and related charges 
with these changes  we anticipated cost savings from reduced headcount  higher utilized facilities and divested non core operations 
however  anticipated cost savings have been impacted from such factors as material price increases  competitive markets and inefficiencies incurred from consolidation of facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further discussion of severance  restructuring and related charges 
outlook for we experienced strong sales performance during from the woods us retail electrical corded products business  offset by lower volumes in our contico and glit business units 
price increases were passed along to our woods us customers during as a result of the rise in copper prices in the last two years and we are implementing additional price increases in we anticipate a reduction in net sales from woods us due to customers moving more of their purchases directly to asian manufacturers 
we continue to implement price increases for the continental  container and contico business units in response to higher raw material costs 
however  in the contico business unit  we face the continuing challenge of passing through price increases to offset these higher costs  and sales volumes have been and are likely to continue to be negatively impacted as a result of raising prices 
we expect that the quality  shipping and production issues present at our glit facilities in will improve over we believe the glit business unit will improve its quality level and cost control in its current operations and as they consolidate the pineville  north carolina operation into the wrens  georgia facility 
we currently believe this consolidation will occur in and will result in improved profitability of our glit business 
in addition  we believe the disruption to our glit operations over the last two years resulted in the loss of certain customers 
while we expect to recover some of these lost sales  we may experience additional lost sales in cost of goods sold is subject to variability in the prices for certain raw materials  most significantly thermoplastic resins used in the manufacture of plastic products for the continental and contico businesses 
prices of plastic resins  such as polyethylene and polypropylene have increased steadily from the latter half of through management has observed that the prices of plastic resins are driven to an extent by prices for crude oil and natural gas  in addition to other factors specific to the supply and demand of the resins themselves 
we are equally exposed to price changes for copper at our woods us and 
table of contents woods canada business units 
prices for copper increased in late and continued through prices for aluminum and steel raw materials used in our metal truck box business  corrugated packaging material and other raw materials have also accelerated over the past year 
we have not employed an active hedging program related to our commodity price risk  but are employing other strategies for managing this risk  including contracting for a certain percentage of resin needs through supply agreements and opportunistic spot purchases 
we have experienced cost increases in the prices of primary raw materials used in our products and inflation on other costs such as packaging materials  utilities and freight 
in a climate of rising raw material costs and especially in  we experience difficulty in raising prices to shift these higher costs to our consumer customers for our plastic products 
our future earnings may be negatively impacted to the extent further increases in costs for raw materials cannot be recovered or offset through higher selling prices 
we cannot predict the direction our raw material prices will take during and beyond 
since the recapitalization  our management has been focused on a number of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives  including the consolidation of facilities  divestiture of non core operations  selling general and administrative sg a cost rationalization and organizational changes 
in the future  we expect to benefit from various profit enhancing strategies such as process improvements including lean manufacturing and six sigma  value engineering products  improved sourcing purchasing and lean administration 
sg a expenses were comparable as a percentage of sales in versus and should remain stable as a percentage of sales in we have completed the process of transferring back office functions of our wilen  glit and disco business units from georgia to bridgeton  missouri  the headquarters of ccp 
we will continue to evaluate the possibility of further consolidation of administrative processes 
interest rates rose in and we expect rates to increase slightly in ultimately  we cannot predict the future levels of interest rates 
with the execution of the sixth amendment under the bank of america credit agreement  the company will have the interest rate margins on all of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit set at the largest margins set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
interest rate margins will return to levels set forth in the bank of america credit agreement subsequent to the delivery of our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
given our history of operating losses  along with guidance provided by the accounting literature covering accounting for income taxes  we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits of domestic deferred tax assets carried on our books 
therefore  except for our profitable foreign subsidiaries  a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset position was recorded at december  and  and we do not expect to record the benefit of any deferred tax assets that may be generated in we will continue to record current expense associated with federal  foreign and state income taxes 
in  our financial performance benefited from favorable currency translation as the canadian dollar strengthened throughout the year against the us dollar 
while we cannot predict the ultimate direction of exchange rates  we do not expect to see the same favorable impact on our financial performance in we expect our working capital levels to remain constant as a percentage of sales 
however  inventory carrying values may be impacted by higher material costs 
cash flow will be used in for capital expenditures and payments due under our term loan as well as the settlement of previously established restructuring accruals 
the majority of these accruals relate to non cancelable lease obligations for abandoned facilities 
these accruals do not create incremental cash obligations in that we are obligated to make the associated payments whether we occupy the facilities or not 
the amount we will ultimately pay out under these accruals is dependent on our ability to successfully sublet all or a portion of the abandoned facilities 
on march   in anticipation of not achieving the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each quarter of  we obtained the sixth amendment to the bank of america credit agreement 
the sixth amendment adjusts the minimum availability such that our eligible collateral must exceed the sum of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility by at least million from the effective date of the sixth amendment through september  and by at least million from september  until the date we deliver our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
subsequent to the delivery of the financial statements for the first quarter of  the sixth amendment reestablishes the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as originally set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
the sixth amendment also reduces the maximum allowable capital expenditures for from million to million  and increases the interest rate margins on all of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit to the largest margins set forth in the bank of america credit agreement 
interest rate margins will return to levels set forth in the bank of america credit agreement subsequent to the delivery of our financial statements for the first quarter of to our lenders 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of the amended covenants  we could seek to obtain further amendments and pursue increased liquidity through additional debt financing and or the sale of assets 
we believe that given our strong working capital base  additional liquidity could be obtained through additional debt financing  if necessary 
however  there is no 
table of contents guarantee that such financing could be obtained 
the company believes that we will be able to comply with all covenants  as amended  throughout in addition  we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to the sale of excess assets and divestitures of certain of our business units 
asset sales and business divestitures present opportunities to provide additional liquidity by de leveraging our financial position

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of katy included in part ii  item certain of our accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in our financial statements 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for all sales  including sales to distributors  at the time the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptances  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is deemed probable 
the company s standard shipping terms are fob shipping point 
the company records sales discounts  returns and allowances in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
sales discounts  returns and allowances  and cooperative advertising are included in net sales  and the provision for doubtful accounts is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these provisions are estimated at the time of sale 
stock based compensation the company follows the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  regarding accounting for stock options and other stock awards 
apb opinion no 
dictates a measurement date concept in the determination of compensation expense related to stock awards including stock options  restricted stock  and stock appreciation rights 
katy s outstanding stock options all have established measurement dates and therefore  fixed plan accounting is applied  generally resulting in no compensation expense for stock option awards 
however  the company has issued stock appreciation rights  stock awards and restricted stock awards which are accounted for as variable stock compensation awards and compensation expense has been recorded for these awards 
compensation expense for stock awards and stock appreciation rights is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  requires companies to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and disallows the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock compensation 
this statement was to be effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after june   however  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a rule that amends the effective date for sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period that begins after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which will require the recording of stock option expense beginning on january   the first day of first quarter of the company expects that stock option expense will approximate million in accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payment from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provision established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of large sized customers  especially our consumer retail customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
our accounting policies state that operating divisions are to identify  at a minimum  those inventory items that are in excess of either one year s historical or one year s forecasted usage  and to use business judgment in determining which is the more appropriate metric 
those inventory items must then be evaluated on a lower of cost or market basis for realization 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any 
table of contents significant unanticipated changes in demand or product developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million  respectively  as of december  and goodwill and impairments of long lived assets in connection with certain acquisitions  we recorded goodwill representing the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  the fair value of each reporting unit that carries goodwill is determined annually  and the fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then no adjustment is necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  appraisals are performed of long lived assets and other adjustments are made to arrive at a revised fair value balance sheet 
this revised fair value balance sheet without goodwill is compared to the fair value of the business previously determined  and a revised goodwill amount is reached 
if the indicated goodwill amount meets or exceeds the current carrying value of goodwill  then no adjustment is required 
however  if the result indicates a reduced level of goodwill  an impairment is recorded to state the goodwill at the revised level 
any future impairments of goodwill determined in accordance with sfas no 
would be recorded as a component of income from continuing operations 
we review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever triggering events indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we monitor our operations to look for triggering events that may cause us to perform an impairment analysis 
these events include  among others  loss of product lines  poor operating performance and abandonment of facilities 
we determine the lowest level at which cash flows are separately identifiable to perform the future cash flows tests  and apply the results to the assets related to those separately identifiable cash flows 
in some cases  this may be at the individual asset level  but in other cases  it is more appropriate to perform this testing at a business unit level especially when poor operating performance was the triggering event 
for assets that are to be held and used  we compare undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and determine if the carrying value of the asset asset group will be recovered by those cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or of the primary asset of an asset group 
if the future undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of the asset asset group will not be recovered  then the asset is marked to fair value 
for assets that are to be disposed of by sale or by a means other than by sale  the identified asset or disposal group if a group of assets or entire business unit is marked to fair value less costs to sell 
in the case of the planned sale of a business unit  sfas no 
indicates that disposal groups should be reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements if cash flows of the disposal group are separately identifiable 
sfas no 
has had an impact on the application of accounting for discontinued operations  making it in general much easier to classify a business unit disposal group held for sale as a discontinued operation 
the rules covering discontinued operations prior to sfas no 
generally required that an entire segment of a business be planned for disposal in order to classify it as a discontinued operation 
we recorded impairments of long lived assets during   and in accordance with sfas no 
 which are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item we also recorded amounts as discontinued operations in and for all periods presented  which are detailed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets also include federal  state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards  primarily due to the significant operating losses incurred during recent years  as well as various tax credits 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration historical net income losses  projected future income losses and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million 
during the year ended december   we increased the valuation allowance by million primarily to provide a full reserve against our net deferred tax asset position 
except for certain of our foreign subsidiaries  given the negative evidence provided by our history of operating losses  and considering guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we were unable to conclude that it is more likely that not that our deferred tax assets would be recoverable through the generation of future taxable income 
we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance requirements based on future operating results and business acquisitions and dispositions  and we may adjust our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
such changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be reflected in current operations through our income tax provision 
workers compensation and product liabilities we make payments for workers compensation and product liability claims generally through the use of a third party claims administrator 
we have purchased insurance coverage for large claims over our self insured retention levels 
our workers compensation and health benefit liabilities are developed using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  and other relevant factors 
in order to consider a range of possible outcomes  we have based our estimates of liabilities in this area on several different sources of loss development factors  including those from the insurance industry  the manufacturing industry  and factors developed in house 
our general approach is to identify a reasonable  logical conclusion  typically in the middle range of the possible outcomes 
while we believe that our liabilities for workers compensation and product liability claims as of december  are adequate and that 
table of contents the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
environmental and other contingencies we and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions are involved in remedial activities at certain present and former locations and have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
under the federal superfund statute  parties could be held jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
based on our estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  we have recorded and accrued for environmental liabilities in amounts that we deem reasonable 
the ultimate costs will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents our best current estimate of the total costs to be incurred 
we expect this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years
