item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading builder of high quality homes in the central ohio primarily the columbus metropolitan statistical area and louisville and lexington  kentucky markets 
our customer driven focus targets entry level and move up home buyers 
we offer a variety of homes that are differentiated by price  size  standard features and available options 
our homes range in price from approximately  to more than  and in size from approximately  to  square feet 
during  we delivered  homes with revenues of million  compared to  homes with revenues of million during we sold  homes during  representing a sales value of million  compared to  homes sold during  representing a sales value of million 
our year end backlog  which consists of homes sold but not yet delivered  declined approximately to sales contracts  with an aggregate sales value of million at december  from sales contracts with an aggregate sales value of million in the average sales value of homes in backlog at year end was  compared to  for the prior year 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the twelve months ended december  the decline in net income from to reflects lower unit sales and a decline in our gross profit margin from in to in during the three year period from through our markets grew and our sales and closings increased at an average annual rate of approximately 
as a result of that growth rate  we initiated plans during to increase the number of communities in both central ohio and louisville  kentucky and to expand our operations into the lexington  kentucky market 
the first quarter of was the most successful sales quarter in our history with total sales of homes 
based on the record and first quarter sales levels  we increased our number of active communities to at december  from at december  because it typically takes a number of years to develop a new community and we did not know whether the sales slowdown would continue  we continued to fund land development during and early in order to insure that our inventory included an adequate number of lots to support communities that were in various stages of development during the commencement and continuation of the sales slowdown 
the development of a community typically occurs over a number of years 
in the initial stage of new development  we gain control of potential sites through the use of option and purchase contracts that are subject to various entitlement contingencies such as zoning  extension of utilities and the mitigation of environmental and wetlands conditions 
during the entitlement or approval period  we complete preliminary engineering and design activities 
upon completion of the entitlement process  we acquire the land and commence construction of streets  utilities  common areas and other improvements 
these activities transform the site from unimproved land to finished lots suitable for the construction of homes 
lot development in a community is 
table of contents typically completed in phases over a three to five year period to allow us to manage the inventory of finished lots and to minimize the amount of capital invested in the community 
because of these time requirements and the uncertainties inherent in the development process  we attempt to maintain our land and lot inventories at a level that approximates four to six years of estimated sales 
in the second quarter of we began to experience a drop off in home sales in each of our markets  which resulted in lower revenue and reduced absorption of lots from our land inventory 
the sales decline and lower inventory absorption continued throughout we believe that this drop off  in part  is reflective of a general downturn in new home sales in the midwest markets and more specifically the columbus market  which experienced an overall decline in new home sales from to in addition  our market share of homes delivered in central ohio declined to approximately in from approximately in these figures were obtained from an annual housing report for prepared by a columbus  ohio real estate service that is unaffiliated with the company 
in response to this decline in demand for our new homes  we implemented several initiatives targeted at improving sales  better managing our overhead expense and reducing our land inventories 
during the second half of  we developed additional incentives for real estate brokers and launched specific and targeted direct marketing campaigns designed to more effectively reach our potential customer base 
we also redesigned our company website to more effectively market our homes and communities to internet users 
during  we targeted two new customer segments with our metropolitan series and grand reserve series and we launched our new millennium series of homes 
we reduced the number of full time employees from a high of in may of to at december  and to at december   and undertook additional cost saving initiatives 
these efforts resulted in a million  or reduction  in our selling  general and administrative expenses compared to the previous year 
the company s land position  which had grown to support the sales levels that were achieved during and  became disproportionate to the lower demand for our homes that we experienced during and in response to the sales downturn  we have slowed the acquisition of land not required for immediate use and delayed the commencement of construction activities for some land that was not already in the development process 
in addition  we sold million of land and recognized gains of million in and sold million of land in cost of real estate sold includes reserves and write offs of costs and deposits for land the company decided not to purchase of approximately million in and million in our land inventory  including estimated lots to be developed on unimproved land  was reduced by to  lots at december  from  lots at december  based on the  closings that took place in  our land inventory represented an year supply versus our target of maintaining a four to six year supply 
we expect to continue to reduce our total investment in land inventories during at december   land held for sale was million 
as the slowdown in sales continued during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was unlikely that we could execute our land and debt reduction plans during and continue to comply with the terms of our bank credit facility the facility 
in particular  we determined that  unless we could successfully amend the facility  it was unlikely that we would satisfy certain financial covenants as of march  and thereafter  including the minimum interest coverage ratio trailing twelve months ebitda divided by interest incurred covenant 
accordingly  during the first quarter of  we proposed to the participating banks an amendment of the facility 
on march   we entered into an amendment of the facility with the participating banks that  among other things  reduced the revolving credit limit  changed the borrowing base limitations  revised various financial covenants including the interest coverage ratio  imposed on us additional business restrictions and secured our borrowings under the facility by liens on substantially all of our assets  including our real estate 
additional information regarding the amended facility is provided below under contractual obligations note payable  banks and liquidity and capital resources 
see also note  note payable  banks in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

table of contents our current mortgage financing services subsidiary  dhfs  is structured as a mortgage broker that accepts loan applications  processes loans and places mortgages with third party lenders 
by acting solely as a middleman between customers and lenders  we have avoided taking interest rate or market risk 
but that also means the breadth of products we offer and the competitiveness of our interest rates is limited by our ability to identify and manage wholesale lender arrangements 
in part because we desire to provide our customers with a wider breadth of products  we and dhfs entered into a non binding letter of intent on february  with wells fargo bank  na  and its wholly owned subsidiary wells fargo ventures  llc collectively  wells fargo  regarding the formation of a joint venture that is intended to operate as a full service mortgage bank to our customers and the general public 
the joint venture  of which wells fargo is expected to own and we are expected to own the remaining  will utilize wells fargo s underwriting expertise  quality control practices  software systems  operating policies and training programs 
it is intended to give our customers access to a full range of competitively priced products from a nationally recognized and aaa rated mortgage lender and loan servicer 
we anticipate that the joint venture will operate as a mortgage bank with its own warehouse credit line to allow more control over the funding and closing process 
we expect to finalize the transaction and complete the implementation of joint venture operations during the second quarter of we expect dhfs to remain in operation at a reduced level for four to six months in order to fully satisfy all commitments to borrowers for loans that have been approved but not funded 
the transaction includes the sale or assignment of business assets and the transfer of most of our mortgage brokerage employees and we expect to report a gain from that sale at the time the transaction is complete 
we anticipate our share of stabilized joint venture income will be comparable to the contribution that is currently being provided by dhfs 
we anticipate that the strategic actions we have implemented will position the company for future growth and profitability 
however  due to the low number of sales contracts in backlog at december   and the reduced margins that we expect to result from the discounting of our homes  we do not expect to achieve a profit in the first quarter of seasonality and variability in quarterly results we experience significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in our homebuilding activity 
prior to  closings and related revenues usually have increased in the second half of the year 
we believe this seasonality reflects the tendency of home buyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter 
weather conditions can also accelerate or delay the scheduling of closings

our average revolving line of credit borrowings outstanding increased to million for compared to million for due to increased investment in land and land development 
although the weighted average borrowing rate for  excluding amortization of bank fees  decreased to from for  the primary reason that interest expense for did not increase proportionately with interest paid was additional interest capitalized into our land development inventories due to the growth in those inventories 
provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense for decreased to million from million for the company s annual effective tax rate decreased to for  from for liquidity and capital resources historically  our capital needs have depended on sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory levels 
our traditional sources of capital have been internally generated cash  bank borrowings and seller financing 
at times  we also have sold our common shares in the public market 
we have incurred indebtedness in the past and expect to incur indebtedness in the future to fund our operations and our investment in land 
we expect the cash flow from our sales in backlog  proceeds from the sale of land and developed lots and funds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility to allow us to meet our short term cash obligations 
the primary reason that we could require additional capital are operating deficits  expansion in our existing markets  expansion into new markets  or purchase of a homebuilding company 
see part i  item ia risk factors our business is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in national and local economic  business and other conditions  most of which are beyond our control 
on march   the company and the participant banks in our facility amended the facility to  among other things  decrease the amount of the facility  change the borrowing base limitations  revise various financial covenants  impose additional business restrictions and secure borrowings under the facility by liens on substantially all of the company s assets  including real estate 
the amount of the facility was reduced from million to million at the closing of the amendment and will subsequently be reduced to million as of september  and to million as of december  and thereafter 
our outstanding borrowings under the facility were approximately million at december  as discussed in the overview section  we have slowed the acquisition of additional land and delayed the commencement of construction activities for land not already in the development process 
we have also identified various land parcels and developed lots that are being offered for sale and these are classified as land held for sale at december  we will continue to evaluate our land holdings and expect that we will identify additional excess 
table of contents inventory that will be offered for sale 
we believe that by limiting our land acquisition and development activities  selling raw land and developed lots and reducing our developed lot inventories through the sale of new homes  we will be able to significantly reduce our total investment in land inventories during and apply a significant portion of the proceeds toward reducing outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the terms of the facility require us to pay an unused commitment fee on the difference between the total amount of the facility and the outstanding obligations under the facility 
in order to minimize the amount of the unused commitment fee  we elected to reduce the total amount of the facility during in accordance with our planned reduction in outstanding borrowings 
the facility amendment includes the revision of certain financial covenants 
the tangible net worth requirement has been increased to million as of march  the maximum allowable leverage ratio has been reduced from to at june  and to at december  the ratio of uncommitted land to consolidated tangible net worth has been reduced from a maximum of at december  to at march   at september  and at december  the minimum interest coverage ratio has been decreased from at december  to at march   at june   at september  and december  and at march  additional fee tiers have been included that will be applicable when interest coverage is less than 
the amendment includes a limitation on the total value of developed unsold lots and lots under development of million at march   million at june   million at september  and million at december  and thereafter 
the definition of the borrowing base calculation has been revised in the amendment and we have agreed to grant a lien on substantially all of our assets  including our real estate  as collateral for the facility 
we believe that the amendment will allow us to execute our plan to reduce land inventories and reduce outstanding debt 
the facility is currently scheduled to expire in may we expect to resume negotiations with our lender group in the latter half of and anticipate that  prior to december   we will execute either an extension of the facility or put in place a new credit facility 
sources and uses of cash for the three year period ended december  during  we generated approximately million of cash flow from operations before net cash flows associated with real estate inventories 
net cash spent on real estate inventories was million  driven by net spending of million associated with increases in land and land development and other costs as we added additional communities  offset by net cash received of million associated with the decrease in homes under construction

net cash spent on real estate inventories was million  driven by a million increase in homes under construction and million associated with increases in land and land development costs 
we invested significantly in land and land development in order to replace communities that had sold out earlier than anticipated  to expand our presence in louisville  kentucky and to enter the lexington  kentucky market 
we used cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
real estate inventories our real estate inventories at december  increased million to million compared to million at december  real estate inventories include land and land development costs  homes under construction  land held for sale and other building materials 
as of december   land and land development costs increased to million from million as of december   homes under construction decreased to million from million on december  and other building material inventories increased to million from million as of december  at december   land held for sale was million  compared to at december  our land and land development costs increased principally due to the increased number of sales communities  including several large communities initiated in that incurred significant development costs during we generally do not purchase land for resale 
however  there are times when we own land that no longer fits into our development plans that we offer for sale  primarily to other homebuilders and commercial developers 
we attempt to maintain a land inventory that is sufficient to meet our anticipated lot needs for the next four to six years 
based on the  homes delivered in  our land inventories represented an year supply at december  at december   we owned lots or land that we estimate could be developed into  lots  including  lots in kentucky 
included in the  lots are lots that we have determined no longer fit into our sales plans and that we are offering for sale to other home builders or commercial developers 
at december   we controlled  through option agreements or contingent contracts  land that we estimate could be developed into  additional lots  including lots in kentucky 
we hold additional contingent agreements for land that may allow us to develop additional lots that are not included in these totals 
however  based on our land review process  we have concluded that it is unlikely that all of the contingencies contained in these other agreements will be satisfied in the near future 
consequently  we did not consider these contingent agreements when estimating the total amount of land or number of lots that we control 
the option agreements that we determined were more than likely to have the contingencies satisfied expire at various dates through we decide whether to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land based upon our assessment of a number of factors  including our existing land inventory at the time  the status of purchase contingencies and our evaluation of the future demand for our homes 

table of contents on december   we had inventory homes  including in kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million  compared to inventory homes  including in louisville  kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million on december  we do not include inventory homes in our number of sales or reported backlog

table of contents the amended facility provides for a variable rate of interest on our borrowings 
the variable rate is the three month libor rate plus a margin based on our interest coverage ratio that ranges from to and is determined quarterly 
the margin was during the first three quarters of and for the fourth quarter of in order to reduce the risks caused by interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts that fix the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under the facility 
the weighted average interest rates for borrowings under the facility for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
these rates include the cost of our interest rate swaps and exclude amortization of bank fees 
interest rates for increased compared to due to a higher average borrowing rate resulting from a higher interest rate environment 
additional information regarding the interest rate swap contracts we have entered into is set forth under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
for a more detailed description of the amended facility  including restrictions on our business activities  see note  note payable  banks in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
seller financing 
from time to time  we purchase land with seller financing 
as of december   we held land for development that was partially financed with seller provided term debt that had an outstanding balance of approximately million 
capital and operating leases 
we believe the best use of our facility is to finance real estate inventories and other investments in our homebuilding operations 
other assets that support our homebuilding operations are also financed through operating lease obligations 
these assets include office facilities  model homes  vehicles and equipment 
we analyze each lease and determine whether the lease is a capital lease  in which case the asset and related obligation is included on our consolidated balance sheet  or an operating lease  in which case the asset and obligation is not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not retain a residual financial interest in leased assets 
we did not have any capital lease obligations outstanding at december  we believe our operating leases are properly classified as off balance sheet transactions 
our minimum rental commitment under such non cancelable operating leases was approximately million at december  for further information on our leases  see note  operating lease commitments  and note  related party transactions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein

off balance sheet arrangements performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit 
we are liable for performance bonds of million and irrevocable letters of credit of million at december  these instruments were issued to municipalities and other individuals to ensure performance and completion of certain land development activities and as collateral for contingent land purchase commitments 
we do not anticipate incurring any liability with respect to these instruments 
variable interest entities 
from time to time  we selectively enter into joint ventures with other homebuilders to own and develop communities 
through the creation of joint venture partnerships and limited liability companies  these joint ventures engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing developed lots to the partners in the joint ventures 
the partners in the joint ventures acquire substantially all of the lots developed by the joint ventures and fund the development costs in proportion to their equity interests 
we receive our percentage interest in the lots developed in the form of capital distributions 
at december   we had ownership interests in seven active joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from to 
these joint ventures generally do not hold debt securities  except for seller requested financing arrangements upon purchasing the land for the joint ventures 
we have determined that our land development joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities that would require consolidation in our financial statements 
see note  land development joint ventures  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in managing our land inventories  we enter into land option and contingent purchase contracts with third parties to acquire unimproved land and developed lots  which may qualify as variable interest entities 
these contracts may be with individual land owners or entities that hold land for sale and generally require us to pay or issue one or a combination of the following refundable deposits  non refundable deposits and letters of credit 
we have determined that certain of these contracts are with variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary  as defined in fin r  of approximately million of land option contracts or contingent purchase contracts 
these contracts were consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet at december  even though we do not have legal title to the land subject to these contracts 
our exposure to loss on these contracts is limited to non refundable option deposits  letters of credit and due diligence expenses  which were approximately million at december  
table of contents cancelable contractual obligations consist of options under which we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase land and contingent purchase contracts under which our obligation to purchase land is subject to the satisfaction of zoning  utility  environmental  title or other contingencies 
we continually evaluate our cancelable contractual obligations to purchase unimproved land and developed lots 
at december   we had approximately million of cancelable contractual obligations for which we had determined it is reasonably likely that we will complete the land or lot purchase 
our good faith deposits and related due diligence costs on these contracts were approximately million at december  in addition  approximately million of performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit were outstanding as collateral for these contingent land purchase commitments at december  assuming that the contingencies are satisfied and that no other significant obstacles to development arise  we expect to purchase most of the residential lots and unimproved land that are subject to these cancelable contractual obligations within the next several years 
we expect to fund our land acquisition and development obligations from internally generated cash and from the borrowing capacity under the facility 
we are in the process of evaluating approximately million of additional cancelable contractual obligations for which we have not yet determined whether it is reasonably likely that we will complete the land or lot purchase 
at december   good faith deposits and related due diligence costs on these contracts were approximately million 
good faith deposits and related due diligence costs are normally charged to earnings when we determine the purchase of the land or lots will not be completed 
however  as of december  we had reserved for million of the million based on management s assessment of the likelihood of completing the land or lot purchase 
we own a interest in a consolidated title insurance agency  alliance title agency  ltd  that provides closing services for our central ohio homes 
at december   our investment in the title insurance agency was approximately  we determined that the title insurance agency is a variable interest entity and consolidated it with our other homebuilding operations effective january  the following is a summary of our commercial commitments under off balance sheet arrangements at december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years commercial commitments letters of credit performance bonds cancelable land contracts total commercial commitments 
table of contents inflation and other cost increases we are not always able to reflect all of our cost increases in the sales price of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount our sales prices 
while we attempt to maintain material  labor and subcontractor costs from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  we may incur additional costs to obtain subcontractors when certain trades are not readily available  which can result in lower gross profits 
periods of rapid price increases can result in lower gross profits

this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting policies the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to real estate inventories  warranty obligations  and construction costs for homes closed 
we base these estimates on historical trends and experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements reserves to reduce our real estate inventories to net realizable value are recorded using several factors  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
these projected cash flows reflect assumptions related to expected future demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of our reserves could be materially affected by changes in market conditions 
estimates for remaining construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home  amounts spent to date and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs change  significant variances may be encountered 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and are based on historical experience and trends in actual warranty costs 
if actual warranty experience changes  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each community and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 

table of contents estimates for capitalized overhead and interest costs are recorded in real estate inventories for interim financial reporting purposes and then adjusted to actual results at year end 
annualized capitalization rates for indirect overhead and interest are determined by estimating the total current year projected development costs  indirect construction costs  interest  closings and ending inventory 
if actual costs  closings or inventory levels change  significant variances to the estimated quarterly capitalization rates results may be encountered 
to minimize this risk  management closely monitors the estimated to actual results on a quarterly basis 
self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with workers compensation and medical benefits 
these accruals include estimates that are based on assumptions about historical loss development factors and actual benefit costs 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated amounts 
we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
if circumstances change  our estimated annual effective tax rate could change  creating variances in quarterly results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we were a party to interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million  as reflected in the table below 
we enter into swap contracts to minimize earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility associated with our variable rate debt 
the swap contracts allow us to have variable rate borrowings and to select the level of fixed rate debt for the company as a whole 
under the swap contracts  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount 
our current intention is to maintain a range of approximately to of our debt at a fixed interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps 
however  market conditions and timing affect the company s ability to maintain this balance between fixed and variable interest rates 
therefore at any time  this percentage may be more or less depending on specific circumstances 
at december   our level of fixed rate debt under the facility  after considering the effect of the interest rate swaps  was approximately 
we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
the swap contracts are more fully described below

 million april  june  million does not reflect a variable rate margin that ranges from to and was at december  the following table presents descriptions of the financial instruments and derivative instruments that we held at december  for the liabilities  the table presents principal calendar year cash flows that exist by maturity date and the related average interest rate 
for the interest rate derivatives  the table presents the notional amounts and expected interest rates that exist by contractual dates 
interest on our variable rate liabilities is libor plus a variable margin ranging from to 
cash flows for interest on million of the variable rate liabilities that are subject to interest rate derivatives is the contractual average fixed pay rate plus the variable margin at december  
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the notional amount of the variable rate liabilities eligible to be fixed with interest rate swaps was approximately million and approximately million at december  and  respectively 
the remaining variable rate liabilities at december  and of and approximately million  respectively  are based upon prime rate  rather than libor 
the fair value of the derivatives at december  and was an asset of approximately million and  respectively 
we do not expect a gain to be realized from the million asset because we expect to retain the swap contracts to maturity
