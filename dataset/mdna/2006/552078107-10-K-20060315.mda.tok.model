item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales ethylene produced by the segment generally is consumed internally as a raw material in the production of derivatives  or is shipped by pipeline to related and unrelated parties 
for the year ended december   
table of contents approximately of lyondell s ethylene  based on sales dollars  was used by the segment s derivatives facilities or sold to related parties at market related prices 
the sales to related parties during include significant ethylene sales  pursuant to a long term ethylene supply agreement  to occidental chemical corporation a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corporation together with its subsidiaries and affiliates  collectively  occidental  which owns approximately of lyondell s outstanding common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the segment consumes propylene in the production of polypropylene and also sells propylene to the po and related products segment at market related prices for use as a raw material in po and other products 
the segment s propylene production that is not consumed internally generally is sold under multi year contracts 
in addition  pursuant to a year propylene supply arrangement entered into in with a subsidiary of sunoco  inc sunoco  the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment supplies million pounds of propylene annually to sunoco 
under the arrangement  a majority of the propylene is supplied under a cost based formula and the balance is supplied on a market related basis 
lyondell generally sells its butadiene under multi year contracts 
the segment sells benzene to the po and related products segment and toluene to lcr at market related prices 
most of the segment s benzene and toluene production that is not consumed internally is sold under multi year contracts 
the segment also sells benzene produced by lcr  which it purchases from lcr at market related prices 
the segment serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr and receives a marketing fee for such services 
the segment produces alkylate for and returns alkylate to lcr for a processing fee  and also sells alkylate under annual and multi year contracts 
lyondell at times purchases ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these products above production levels 
volumes of ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes generally do not have a significant impact on profitability 
the co products that are not consumed internally generally are sold to customers with whom lyondell has had long standing relationships 
these sales generally are made under written agreements that typically provide for monthly negotiation of price and customer purchases of a specified minimum quantity 
mtbe produced at one of the two channelview units is sold to the po and related products segment and lcr at market related prices 
mtbe is produced for lcr at the second channelview unit for a processing fee 
in addition  mtbe produced at the chocolate bayou plant is sold at market related prices to the po and related products segment 
most of the ethylene and propylene production of the channelview  chocolate bayou  corpus christi  la porte and lake charles facilities is shipped via a pipeline system which has connections to numerous gulf coast ethylene and propylene consumers 
this pipeline system  some of which is owned and some of which is leased by the company  extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur  texas as well as around the lake charles  louisiana area 
in addition  exchange agreements with other ethylene and co products producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to this pipeline system 
some ethylene is shipped by railcar from clinton  iowa to morris  illinois and also to customers 
a pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to transport ethylene from morris  illinois to tuscola  illinois 
some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel 
butadiene  benzene  toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline  railcar  truck  barge or ocean going vessel 
polyethylene products primarily are sold to an extensive base of established customers 
approximately two thirds of lyondell s domestic polyethylene product volumes are sold to customers under annual or multi year contracts 
the remainder of the polyethylene volume generally is sold under customary terms and conditions without formal contracts 
in either case  in most of the continuous supply relationships  prices are subject to change upon mutual agreement 

table of contents eo and eg typically are sold under multi year contracts  with market based pricing 
glycol ethers  ethanolamines and brake fluids are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market prices 
ethanol and ethers primarily are sold under contracts at market prices 
eo is shipped by railcar  and its derivatives are shipped by railcar  truck  isotank or ocean going vessel 
with the exception of a small amount of vam consumed internally  vam generally is sold into domestic and export markets under multi year contracts  and also on a spot basis 
acetic acid that is not consumed internally for the production of vam generally is sold into domestic and export markets under multi year contracts  and also on a spot basis 
contract pricing for sales of vam and acetic acid generally is determined by market based negotiation  market index or cost based formulas 
through an agreement with dupont  a portion of the acetic acid produced at the la porte  texas plant also is converted into vam through dupont s nearby vam plant and the segment acquires all of the vam production at dupont s plant that is not utilized internally by dupont 
the contract expires on december  vam and acetic acid are shipped by barge  ocean going vessel  pipeline  tank car and tank truck 
the segment has bulk storage arrangements in europe and asia to better serve its customers requirements in those regions 
sales are made through a direct sales force  agents and distributors 
the la porte  texas methanol facility is owned by la porte methanol company  lyondell s owned joint venture 
each party to the joint venture receives its respective share of the methanol production 
lyondell s acetyls business uses the methanol as a raw material for acetic acid and also sells the methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large domestic customers 
the product is shipped by barge and pipeline 
other derivatives products are primarily distributed by railcar 
the vast majority of the derivatives products are sold in north america and europe  primarily through lyondell s sales organization 
sales agents are generally engaged to market the derivatives products in the rest of the world 
no single ethylene  co products and derivatives customer accounted for or more of lyondell s revenues in for geographic data  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition and industry conditions the bases for competition in the ethylene  co products and derivatives businesses are price  product quality  product delivery  reliability of supply  product performance and customer service 
industry consolidation has brought north american production capacity under the control of fewer  although larger  competitors 
profitability of the segment is affected not only by supply and demand for ethylene  co products and derivatives  but also by raw material costs and price competition among producers  which may intensify due to  among other things  the addition of new capacity 
in general  demand is a function of economic growth in the united states and elsewhere in the world  which fluctuates 
it is not possible to accurately predict the changes in raw material costs  market conditions  capacity utilization and other factors that will affect industry profitability in the future 
in  ethylene markets began a cyclical recovery from the downturn brought about by the prior three years of weak demand 
the shutdown of two of a competitor s us gulf coast ethylene and co products plants in and improving demand  driven by worldwide economic recovery  resulted in greatly improved industry operating rates in and however  in  temporary hurricane related shutdowns greatly impacted supply and demand during the last four months of over the next five years  forecasts for the worldwide average annual ethylene capacity additions are projected at more than  with more than half of these additions in the middle east and northeast asia 
the average worldwide demand growth is expected to lag this rate only by approximately 
in the us  minor capacity increases combined with sustained demand levels are projected to result in continued high average operating rates in the next few years 
capacity share figures for lyondell s facilities in this segment and those of its competitors  discussed below  are based on completed production facilities and  where appropriate  include the full capacity of joint venture facilities and certain long term supply arrangements

there are many other north american producers of polyethylene  the most significant of which are chevronphillips  dow and exxonmobil 
lyondell also is the second largest producer of vam and acetic acid in north america  and the third largest producer worldwide  based on published rated production capacity 
po and related products segment overview the core product of lyondell s po and related products segment is po  which lyondell produces through two distinct technologies based on indirect oxidation processes that yield co products 
one process yields tba as the co product  the other yields sm as the co product 
the two technologies are mutually exclusive  necessitating that a manufacturing facility be dedicated either to po tba or to po sm 
mtbe and etbe are the principal derivatives of tba 
the po and related products segment also includes tdi and derivatives of po  including pg  pge and bdo 
in north america  lyondell produces po  tba  pg and pge at its bayport pasadena  texas plants and po  sm  mtbe and bdo at its channelview  texas plants 
lyondell also has the ability to produce etbe at its channelview  texas plant as an alternative to mtbe production 
the bayport po tba plants and the channelview po sm i plant are owned by the us po manufacturing joint venture the us po joint venture between lyondell and bayer 
the channelview po sm ii plant is owned by lyondell together with unrelated equity investors 
in europe  lyondell produces po  tba  pg  pge  bdo and mtbe at plants at botlek near rotterdam  the netherlands and  with minor modifications  lyondell could produce etbe at botlek as an alternative to mtbe production 
additionally  lyondell produces po and sm at a plant located at maasvlakte near rotterdam  the netherlands  which is operated by lyondell and is owned by a joint venture with bayer in which lyondell has a interest 
lyondell produces po  tba  pg  mtbe and etbe at a plant in fos sur mer  france 
in the asia pacific region  lyondell has a interest in nihon oxirane co  ltd 
nihon oxirane  a joint venture that operates a po sm plant and a pg plant in chiba  japan 
in europe  rhodia interm diaires rhodia operates a tdi facility located in pont de claix  france on behalf of lyondell 
see joint ventures and other agreements 
in  lyondell ceased production of tdi at its lake charles  louisiana plant 
lyondell estimates  based in part on published data  that worldwide demand for po was approximately billion pounds in approximately of that volume was consumed in the manufacture of three families of po derivative products polyols  glycols and glycol ethers 
the remainder was consumed in the manufacture of performance products  including bdo and its derivatives 
polyols are used primarily in the production of 
table of contents polyurethanes 
po sold in the merchant market accounted for less than of lyondell s total revenues in  the first full year that equistar and millennium were consolidated subsidiaries of lyondell 
po sold in the merchant market accounted for approximately of lyondell s total revenues in and in pg principally is used to produce unsaturated polyester resins and also is used in certain food  cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications and in automotive coolants and aircraft deicers 
pge are used as solvents for paints  coatings and cleaners 
bdo and its derivatives are utilized in the production of fibers  engineering plastics  pharmaceuticals  personal care products and high performance coatings 
sm is produced and sold worldwide for commodity and specialty polymer applications  such as polystyrene and unsaturated polyester resins  as well as various uses in the rubber industry 
based on published data  worldwide demand for sm in was approximately billion pounds 
sm accounted for less than of lyondell s total revenues in  and in and lyondell converts most of its tba to isobutylene  which is reacted with methanol to produce mtbe or is reacted with ethanol to produce etbe 
mtbe and etbe are oxygenated gasoline blending components that increase octane and reduce automotive emissions 
etbe produced in europe also addresses europe s growing demand for biofuels 
mtbe and etbe together accounted for approximately of lyondell s total revenues in  in and in worldwide demand for mtbe in is estimated to have been approximately  barrels per day  based on published data 
in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  used in gasoline sold as reformulated fuel in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft led to public concern about the use of mtbe and resulted in us federal and state governmental initiatives to reduce or ban the use of mtbe 
at this time  lyondell cannot predict the full impact that the us federal legislation  state governmental initiatives and bans  and commercial actions will have on mtbe margins or volumes longer term 
lyondell intends to continue marketing mtbe in the us  as well as outside of the us however  should it become necessary or desirable to significantly reduce mtbe production as a result of state bans or commercial decisions by refiners  blenders and pipelines to discontinue use or transportation of mtbe  lyondell has or will have  with minimal additional capital investment  the flexibility to produce alternative gasoline blending components  such as iso octane  iso octene also known as di isobutylene or etbe 
see item a 
risk factors risks relating to the businesses legislative and other actions may reduce lyondell s mtbe sales and cause lyondell to produce less profitable alternative gasoline blending components instead  and may cause lcr s revenues to decline due to reduced sales of finished gasoline products  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding these us federal and state initiatives and their potential impact on lyondell 
tdi is used primarily in the production of polyurethanes for flexible foam applications ranging from furniture  bedding and carpet underlay to transportation and packaging 
additionally  tdi is used in the manufacture of coatings  sealants  adhesives and elastomers 
the following table outlines the primary products of lyondell s po and related products segment  annual processing capacities as of december   and the primary uses for such products 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacities were calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than capacities set forth below

raw materials the primary raw materials used by the po and related products segment are propylene  butane  ethylene  benzene and methanol 
the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil and its principal refinery derivatives  natural gas liquids  and natural gas  as well as market conditions 
table of contents for these materials 
these materials are received in bulk quantities via pipeline or marine vessels 
generally  the segment s raw materials requirements are purchased at market based prices from numerous suppliers in the united states and europe with which lyondell has established contractual relationships  as well as in the spot market 
in the us  the po and related products segment obtains a large portion of its propylene  benzene and ethylene raw materials from the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment and expects this to be the case in raw materials for the non us businesses primarily are obtained from unrelated parties 
the segment consumes a portion of its internally produced po in the production of derivatives 
the po and related products segment is a large volume consumer of isobutane for chemical production 
lyondell has invested in facilities  or entered into processing agreements with unrelated parties  to convert the widely available commodity  normal butane  to isobutane 
the segment also is a large consumer of oxygen for its po tba plants at bayport  texas  botlek rotterdam  the netherlands  and fos sur mer  france 
pursuant to an agreement being phased in over time from through  methanex is the exclusive supplier of the worldwide methanol raw material requirements for lyondell other than for its acetyls businesses  which lyondell acquired in november 
the agreement provides supplies of methanol at cost based prices  and methanex has an option to extend the agreement for an additional three year period 
lyondell purchases its ethanol requirements for the production of etbe from regional producers and importers in europe at market related prices 
the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for the po and related products business 
the segment s raw materials are  in general  commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 
historically  raw material availability has not been an issue 
however  in order to enhance reliability and competitiveness of prices and rates for supplies of raw materials  industrial gas and other utilities  lyondell is party to long term agreements and other arrangements with suppliers  including the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment  for a substantial portion of its production requirements

risk factors risks relating to the businesses costs of raw materials and energy  as well as reliability of supply  may result in increased operating expenses and reduced results of operations and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales in  most of the segment s revenues were derived from sales to  or processing agreements with  unrelated parties 
in  no single po and related products customer accounted for or more of lyondell s total revenues 
the po and related products segment produces and delivers products through sales agreements  processing agreements and spot sales as well as product exchanges 
production levels at lyondell s po sm and po tba co product production facilities primarily are determined by the demand for po and po derivatives 
the resulting production levels of co products sm and mtbe thus depend primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for sm and mtbe  as well as the operational flexibility of lyondell s multiple production facilities in meeting this demand 
lyondell purchases sm and mtbe for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these co products above co product production levels 
volumes of sm and mtbe purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability

table of contents inorganic chemicals segment overview lyondell s inorganic chemicals businesses are conducted through millennium  which has been a wholly owned subsidiary since lyondell s november  acquisition of millennium 
tio is the primary product of the inorganic chemicals segment  which accounted for less than of lyondell s total revenues in  the first full year that millennium was a consolidated subsidiary of lyondell 
tio accounted for approximately and of millennium s total revenues in and  respectively 
tio is a white pigment used for imparting whiteness  brightness  opacity and durability in a wide range of products  including paint and coatings  plastics  paper and elastomers 
as of december   the annual tio production capacity of lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment  using the chloride process and the sulfate process discussed below  was approximately  metric tons 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacities were calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than capacities set forth below 
tio production process annual capacity percentage of capacity chloride process  metric tons sulfate process  metric tons total  metric tons tio is produced in two crystalline forms rutile and anatase 
rutile tio is primarily used in paint and coatings  ink and plastics 
anatase tio is primarily used in paper  ceramics  rubber and man made fibers 
tio is manufactured using two different technologies 
the newer chloride process is a high temperature process in which chlorine is used to produce an intermediate tio rutile crystal pigment  with greater purity and higher control over the size distribution of the pigment particles than the alternative sulfate process permits 
in general  the chloride process is also less intensive than the sulfate process in terms of labor and energy 
because much of the chlorine can be recycled  the chloride process produces less waste than does the sulfate process 
the sulfate process is a wet chemical process that uses concentrated sulfuric acid to produce either an intermediate tio anatase or rutile crystal pigment 
the sulfate process generates higher volumes of waste  including iron sulfate and spent sulfuric acid 
lyondell s tio plants are located in the four major world markets for tio north america  south america  western europe and the asia pacific region 
the north american plants  consisting of one in baltimore  maryland and two in ashtabula  ohio  use the chloride process 
the plant in salvador  bahia  brazil uses the sulfate process 
lyondell also owns a mineral sands mine located at mataraca  paraiba  brazil  which supplies the brazilian plant with most of its titanium ores 
as of december   the mine had approximately million metric tons of recoverable ilmenite reserves  approximately  metric tons of zircon reserves and approximately  metric tons of natural rutile reserves 
the mine produced approximately  metric tons of ilmenite  a titanium bearing ore  in approximately  metric tons of ilmenite produced at the mine were processed by the salvador tio 

plant in  while approximately metric tons were sold to unrelated parties 
the mine also produced approximately  metric tons of zircon and approximately  metric tons of natural rutile titanium ore  all of which were sold to unrelated parties 
the stallingborough  united kingdom plant uses the chloride process 
the plants in france at le havre  normandy and thann  alsace use the sulfate process 
the kemerton plant in western australia uses the chloride process 

table of contents lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment also produces a number of specialty and performance tio related products  some of which are manufactured at dedicated facilities and others of which are manufactured at facilities that also produce other tio products 
these products include titanium tetrachloride ticl  titanyl sulfate ticl  ultra fine ticl and silica gel 
raw materials naturally occurring titanium bearing ores such as ilmenite and natural rutile occur as sand or hard rock deposits in various parts of the world and are used as raw materials in the tio extraction process 
mining companies are increasingly treating ilmenite to extract iron and other minerals to produce slag or synthetic rutile with higher tio concentrations  resulting in lower amounts of wastes and by products during processing by tio pigment plants 
generally  titanium bearing ores are shipped by using bulk carriers from terminals in the country of origin to tio production plants  usually located near port facilities 
the segment obtains ores from a number of suppliers in south africa  australia  canada  brazil and norway  generally pursuant to multi year supply contracts 
rio tinto iron titanium inc through its affiliates richards bay iron titanium proprietary limited and qit fer et titane inc and iluka resources limited are the world s largest producers of titanium ores and accounted for approximately of the titanium ores purchased for lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment in other major raw materials used in the production of tio are chlorine  caustic soda  coke  aluminum  sodium silicate  sodium aluminate  sulfuric acid  oxygen  nitrogen and natural gas 
the number of sources for and availability of these materials is specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located 
there are certain risks related to the acquisition of raw materials from less developed or developing countries 
see item a 
risk factors risks relating to the businesses lyondell s international operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  exchange controls  political risks and other risks relating to non us operations 
a number of the raw materials used by lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment in the production of tio and the segment s other products are provided by only a few vendors and  accordingly  if one significant supplier or a number of significant suppliers were unable to meet their obligations under present supply arrangements  the inorganic chemicals segment could suffer reduced supplies and or be forced to incur increased costs for these raw materials 
for example  for the australian plant  chlorine and caustic soda are obtained exclusively from one supplier under a long term supply agreement 
see item a 
risk factors risks relating to the businesses costs of raw materials and energy  as well as reliability of supply  may result in increased operating expenses and reduced results of operations 
however  at the present time  chloride and sulfate process raw materials are available in sufficient quantities 
marketing and sales of the tio sold by lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment in  approximately was sold to customers in the paint and coatings industry  approximately to customers in the plastics industry  approximately to customers in the paper industry  and approximately to other customers 
the inorganic chemicals segment experiences some seasonality in its tio 

sales because  in general  its customers production of paint and coatings are greatest in the spring and summer months 
tio generally is sold by the segment at prices determined by market based negotiation under annual and multi year contracts 
tio is sold either directly to customers or  to a lesser extent  through agents or distributors  and is distributed by rail  truck and ocean carrier in either dry or slurry form 
no single inorganic chemicals customer accounted for or more of lyondell s total revenues in for geographic data  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition and industry conditions the bases for competition in the inorganic chemicals businesses are price  product quality  product performance  product delivery  customer service and reliability of supply 
the major competitors for sales of 
table of contents tio are dupont  huntsman tioxide huntsman tioxide  a business unit of huntsman corporation  kronos worldwide  inc kronos and tronox incorporated tronox  formerly a business unit of kerr mcgee corporation 
lyondell estimates that collectively  as of december   dupont  lyondell  huntsman tioxide  kronos and tronox accounted for approximately of the world s tio production capacity 
lyondell is the second largest producer of tio in the world  based on published rated capacity 
in certain applications  tio competes with other whitening agents that are generally less effective but less expensive 
these alternate products include kaolin clays  calcium carbonate pigments and synthetic polymers materials 
generally  new plant capacity additions in the tio industry are slow to develop because of the substantial capital expenditure required and the significant lead time three to five years typically for a new plant needed for planning  obtaining environmental approvals and permits  construction of manufacturing facilities and arranging for raw material supplies 
dupont has announced plans to construct a  ton per year tio plant in dongying  china with a planned completion date of debottlenecking and other capacity expansions at existing plants require substantially less time and capital and can also increase overall industry capacity 
other chemicals lyondell also produces fragrance and flavors chemicals 
the brunswick  georgia and jacksonville  florida facilities manufacture terpene based fragrance ingredients and flavor ingredients  primarily for the oral care markets 
these products are also used in a number of other applications  including chemical reaction agents  or initiators  for the rubber industry and solvents and cleaners  such as pine oil  for the hard surface cleaner markets 
refining segment overview lyondell participates in petroleum refining through an equity interest in lcr  a limited partnership organized under the laws of the state of delaware 
lyondell holds a interest in lcr and citgo holds a interest in lcr 
lyondell owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
similarly  citgo  which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of pdvsa  the national oil company of venezuela  owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
lcr owns and operates a refinery the refinery  which is located on the houston ship channel in houston  texas 
lcr was formed in to upgrade the refinery s ability to process substantial volumes of lower cost  heavy  high sulfur crude oil 
as of december   the refinery s heavy  high sulfur crude oil processing capacity was approximately  barrels per day 
the refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to run heavy to degrees api  high sulfur crude oil 
this crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals  making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other high value fuel products  but has historically been less costly to purchase 
processing heavy  high sulfur crude oil in significant quantities requires a refinery with extensive coking  catalytic cracking  hydrotreating and desulfurization capabilities  ie  a complex refinery 
the refinery s complexity enables it to operate in full conversion mode  producing a slate of products that consists primarily of high value  clean products 
the refinery s clean products include premium grades such as reformulated gasoline  jet fuel  low sulfur diesel and aromatics 
the refinery s products also include conventional gasoline  lube oils industrial lubricants  white oils and process oils  carbon black oil  refinery grade propylene  sulfur  residual fuel and petroleum coke 
gasoline accounted for approximately of 
table of contents lcr s total revenues in  in and in diesel accounted for approximately of lcr s total revenues in  in and in the aromatics produced by the refinery are benzene  toluene  orthoxylene and paraxylene 
these products are sold to manufacturers of intermediate chemicals and polyester intermediates and are ultimately used in clothing  soft drink bottles and drinking cups  audio and video tapes  and resins 
the following table outlines the primary products of lyondell s refining segment  annual rated capacity on a calendar day basis as of december   and the primary uses for such products 
the term rated capacity  as used in this table  is calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the rated capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  the actual production volumes may be more or less than the rated capacity 
capacities shown represent of the capacity of lcr  of which lyondell owns 
product rated capacity primary uses gasoline a  barrels per day automotive fuel diesel distillate a  barrels per day fuel for diesel cars and trucks jet fuel a  barrels per day aviation fuel benzene b million gallons per year nylon for clothing and consumer items  polystyrene for insulation  packaging and drink cups toluene c million gallons per year gasoline component and chemical raw material for producing benzene paraxylene d million pounds per year polyester fibers for clothing and fabrics  pet soft drink bottles and films for audio and video tapes orthoxylene d million pounds per year plasticizer in products such as rainwear  shower curtains  toys and auto upholstery and an intermediate in paints and fiberglass lube oils a  barrels per day automotive and industrial engine and lube oils  railroad engine additives and white oils for food grade applications a produced by lcr and sold to citgo 
b produced by lcr and sold to the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment 
c produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment 
d produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by citgo 
management of lcr lcr is governed by a limited partnership agreement  which provides that lcr is managed by a partnership governance committee composed of six representatives  three of whom are appointed by each general partner 
the day to day operations of the refinery are managed by a general manager  who is a loaned 
table of contents employee of lyondell 
lyondell and citgo also perform various administrative services for lcr pursuant to an administrative services agreement 
raw materials in  lcr entered into a long term crude supply agreement the crude supply agreement with pdvsa petr leo  sa pdvsa oil  an affiliate of citgo and of pdvsa 
most of the crude oil used by lcr as a raw material for its refinery is purchased under the crude supply agreement 
both pdvsa oil and citgo are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of pdvsa 
the crude supply agreement  which expires on december   incorporates formula prices to be paid by lcr for the crude oil supplied based on the market value of a slate of refined products deemed to be produced from each particular crude oil or raw material  less certain deemed refining costs  adjustable for inflation and energy costs  certain actual costs  and a deemed margin  which varies according to the grade of crude oil or other raw material delivered 
the actual refining margin earned by lcr may vary from the formula amount depending on  among other things  timing differences in incorporating changes in refined product market values and energy costs into the crude supply agreement s deemed margin calculations and the efficiency with which lcr conducts its operations 
although lcr believes that the crude supply agreement reduces the volatility of lcr s earnings and cash flows over the long term  the crude supply agreement also limits lcr s ability to enjoy higher margins during periods when the market price of crude oil is low relative to the then current market prices for refined products 
in addition  if the actual yields  costs or volumes of the lcr refinery differ substantially from those contemplated by the crude supply agreement  the benefits of this agreement to lcr could be substantially diminished  and could result in lower earnings and cash flow for lcr 
furthermore  there may be periods during which lcr s costs for crude oil under the crude supply agreement may be higher than might otherwise be available to lcr from other sources 
expansion or contraction of the average market heavy crude oil refining margin can result in situations in which the crude supply agreement per barrel margin is either greater than or less than the margin that could be obtained through open market purchases of heavy crude oil 
for example  from to the early portion of  the crude supply agreement contract was advantageous to lcr  however  during the fourth quarter of and throughout  the crude supply agreement per barrel margin was less than the margin that could be obtained through open market purchases of heavy crude oil 
the crude supply agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the crude supply agreement so long as pdvsa has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
however  there are risks associated with reliance on pdvsa oil for supplies of crude oil and with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non united states affiliates of a sovereign nation 
all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years 
venezuela may continue to experience these difficulties and changes 
it is impossible to predict how governmental policies may change under the current or any subsequent venezuelan government 
in addition  there are risks associated with enforcing judgments of united states courts against entities whose assets are located outside of the united states and whose management does not reside in the united states 
although the parties have negotiated certain alternative arrangements in the event of specified force majeure conditions  including venezuelan governmental or other actions restricting or otherwise limiting pdvsa oil s ability to perform its obligations  any such alternative arrangements may not be as beneficial to lcr as the crude supply agreement 
from time to time  the company and pdvsa have had discussions covering both a restructuring of the crude supply agreement and a broader restructuring of the lcr partnership 
the company is unable to predict whether changes in either arrangement will occur 
subject to rights of first offer and first refusal  the partners each have a right to transfer their interests in lcr to unaffiliated third parties in certain circumstances 
if neither citgo  pdvsa oil nor their affiliates were a partner in lcr  pdvsa oil would have an option to terminate the crude supply agreement 
depending on 
table of contents then current market conditions  any modification  breach or termination of the crude supply agreement  or any interruption in this source of crude oil  would require lcr to purchase all or a portion of its crude oil in the merchant market  could subject lcr to significant volatility and price fluctuations and could adversely affect lcr and  therefore  lyondell 
alternative crude oil supplies with similar margins may not be available for purchase by lcr 
under the crude supply agreement  generally pdvsa oil is required to sell and lcr is required to purchase  barrels per day of heavy crude oil  which constitutes approximately of lcr s refining capacity of  barrels per day of crude oil 
from through  pdvsa oil  from time to time  declared itself in a force majeure situation and subsequently reduced deliveries of crude oil 
such reductions in deliveries were purportedly based on announced opec production cuts 
at such times  pdvsa oil informed lcr that the venezuelan government  through the ministry of energy and mines  had instructed that production of certain grades of crude oil be reduced 
in certain circumstances  pdvsa oil made payments to lcr under a different provision of the crude supply agreement in partial compensation for such reductions 
lcr has consistently contested the validity of pdvsa oil s and pdvsa s reductions in deliveries under the crude supply agreement 
the parties have different interpretations of the provisions of the contracts concerning the delivery of crude oil 
the contracts do not contain dispute resolution procedures  and the parties have been unable to resolve their commercial dispute 
as a result  on february   lcr filed a lawsuit against pdvsa and pdvsa oil in connection with the force majeure declarations  which lcr is continuing to litigate 
see item legal proceedings litigation matters 
marketing and sales the refinery produces gasoline  low sulfur diesel  jet fuel  aromatics  lube oils and certain industrial products 
on a weekly basis  lcr evaluates and determines the optimal product output mix for the refinery  based on spot market prices and conditions 
under a long term product sales agreement the products agreement  citgo is obligated to purchase and lcr is required to sell of the finished gasoline  jet fuel  heating oil  diesel fuel  coke and sulfur produced by the refinery 
the products are transported to citgo via pipeline  rail cars  barge and truck 
citgo purchases these products at market related prices based on regional industry benchmark indexes 
for example  the price for gasoline is based on prices published by platts oilgram  an industry trade publication 
the products agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s material decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the products agreement so long as citgo has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
the products agreement expires on december  under the terms of lubricant sales agreements expiring on december   citgo purchases all of the lube oils manufactured by lcr 
in addition  citgo serves as lcr s sole agent to market paraxylene and orthoxylene produced by lcr 
the ethylene  co products and derivatives segment purchases benzene produced by lcr  and also serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr 
competition and industry conditions the refining business tends to be volatile as well as cyclical 
crude oil prices  which are impacted by worldwide political events and the economics of exploration and production in addition to refined products demand  are the largest source of the volatility 
demand for refined products is influenced by seasonal and short term factors such as weather and driving patterns  as well as by longer term issues such as the economy  energy conservation and alternative fuels 
industry refined products supply is also dependent on industry operating capabilities and on long term refining capacity trends 
growth in demand for refined products without comparable growth in supply has led to tight refined products supply conditions in the us management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement generally has the effect of stabilizing earnings and cash flows and reducing the market driven aspects of the business volatility over the long term 

table of contents with a capacity of approximately  barrels per day  the company believes that the refinery is one of north america s largest full conversion ie  not producing asphalt or high sulfur heavy fuel refineries capable of processing heavy  high sulfur crude oil 
among lcr s refining competitors are major integrated oil companies and domestic refiners that are owned by or affiliated with major integrated oil companies 
based on published industry data  as of december   there were crude oil refineries in operation in the united states  and total domestic refinery capacity was approximately million barrels per day 
during  lcr processed an average of approximately  barrels per day of crude oil or approximately of all us crude capacity 
environmental capital expenditures lyondell and lcr together with the industries in which they operate are subject to extensive national  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  and are required to have permits and licenses regulating  emissions to the air  discharges onto land or waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials

risk factors there are many factors that may affect the businesses and results of operations of lyondell and its joint ventures 
for additional discussion regarding factors that may affect the businesses and operating results of lyondell and its joint ventures  see item business  item legal proceedings  forward looking statements  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
disclosure of market risk 
if one or more of these risks actually occur  lyondell s business  financial position or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks relating to the businesses costs of raw materials and energy  as well as reliability of supply  may result in increased operating expenses and reduced results of operations 
lyondell purchases large amounts of raw materials and energy for its businesses 
the cost of these raw materials and energy  in the aggregate  represents a substantial portion of its operating expenses 
the costs of raw 
table of contents materials and energy used for most of its products generally follow price trends of  and vary with the market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas  which may be highly volatile and cyclical 
raw material and energy costs increased during and remain at high levels 
there have been in the past  and will likely be in the future  periods of time when lyondell is unable to pass raw material and energy cost increases on to customers quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on its results of operations 
customer consolidation also has made it more difficult to pass along cost increases to customers 
lyondell s results of operations have been  and could be in the future  significantly affected by increases and volatility in these costs 
cost increases also may increase working capital needs  which could reduce lyondell s liquidity and cash flow 
in addition  when raw material and energy costs increase rapidly and are passed along to customers as product price increases  the credit risks associated with certain customers can be compounded 
see lyondell sells commodity products in highly competitive markets and faces significant price pressures below 
in addition  higher north american natural gas prices relative to natural gas cost advantaged regions  such as the middle east  have diminished the ability of many domestic chemical producers to compete internationally since natural gas prices affect a significant portion of the industry s raw materials and energy sources 
this environment has in the past caused and may in the future cause a reduction in equistar s exports  and has in the past reduced and may in the future reduce the competitiveness of us producers 
it also has in the past increased the competition for sales of chemicals in north america  as us production that would otherwise have been sold overseas was instead offered for sale domestically  resulting in excess supply and lower margins in north america  and may do so in the future 
furthermore  across lyondell  there are a limited number of suppliers for some of its raw materials and utilities and  in some cases  the number of sources for and availability of raw materials is specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located 
in addition  for some lyondell products  the facilities and or distribution channels of raw material suppliers and lyondell form an integrated system 
this is especially true in the us gulf coast where the infrastructure of the petrochemical industry is tightly integrated such that a major disruption of supply of a given commodity can negatively affect numerous participants  including suppliers of other raw materials 
if one or more of lyondell s significant suppliers were unable to meet its obligations under present supply arrangements or supplies are otherwise disrupted  lyondell s businesses could suffer reduced supplies or be forced to incur increased costs for their raw materials  which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations 
for example  hurricanes katrina and rita negatively affected crude oil and natural gas supplies  as well as supplies of some of lyondell s other raw materials  contributing to increases in raw material prices during the second half of and  in some cases  disrupting production 
in addition  hurricane related disruption of rail and pipeline traffic in the us gulf coast area negatively affected shipments of raw materials and product 
the cyclicality of the chemical and refining industries may cause significant fluctuations in lyondell s operating results 
lyondell s historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply demand balance in both the chemical and refining industries  and lyondell s future operating results continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility 
these industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods when substantial capacity is added  resulting in oversupply  declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 
the cyclicality of these industries results in volatile profits and cash flow over the business cycles 
the chemical industry has entered a period characterized by tight supply in many product areas and increased demand as the global economy has improved over the past several years 
as a result  the industry has seen a return to enhanced profitability  even in a world of volatile raw material and energy costs 
however  the sustainability of these positive business conditions remains subject to uncertainty 
the global economic and political environment continues to be uncertain  and negative changes could result in a decline in demand and 
table of contents place pressure on lyondell s results of operations 
in addition  new capacity additions by some participants in the industry  especially those in the middle east and asia that are expected to start up beginning in and through the latter part of the decade  could lead to another period of oversupply and poor profitability 
lyondell may reduce production at or idle a facility for an extended period of time or exit a business because of an oversupply of a particular product and or a lack of demand for that particular product  or high raw material prices  which makes production uneconomical 
any decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business would result in impairment and other charges to earnings 
temporary outages sometimes last for several quarters or  in certain cases  longer  and could cause lyondell to incur costs  including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities 
it is possible that factors such as increases in raw material costs or lower demand in the future will cause lyondell to reduce operating rates  idle facilities or exit uncompetitive businesses 
external factors beyond lyondell s or lcr s control can cause fluctuations in demand for their products and in their prices and margins  which may result in lower operating results 
external factors beyond lyondell s or lcr s control can cause volatility in the price of raw materials and other operating costs  as well as significant fluctuations in demand for their products and can magnify the impact of economic cycles on its businesses 
examples of external factors include general economic conditions  international events and circumstances  competitor actions  governmental regulation in the us and abroad  and severe weather and natural disasters 
lyondell believes that events in the middle east have had a particularly adverse influence on its businesses in recent years and may continue to do so 
in addition  a number of lyondell s products are highly dependent on durable goods markets  such as the housing and automotive markets  which also are cyclical 
many of lyondell s products are components of other chemical products that  in turn  are subject to the supply demand balance of both the chemical and refining industries and general economic conditions 
the global economy has improved  increasing demand for lyondell s products and resulting in improved operating results as operations have approached full capacity for the majority of lyondell s products 
this has occurred even as the volatility and elevated level of prices for crude oil and natural gas have resulted in increased raw material costs 
however  the impact of the factors cited above and others may once again cause a slowdown in the business cycle  reducing demand and lowering operating rates and  ultimately  reducing profitability 
lyondell sells commodity products in highly competitive markets and faces significant price pressures 
lyondell sells its products in highly competitive markets 
due to the commodity nature of many of its products  competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on product performance  product quality  product deliverability  reliability of supply and customer service 
as a result  lyondell generally is not able to protect its market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to its customers 
accordingly  increases in raw material and other costs may not necessarily correlate with changes in prices for these products  either in the direction of the price change or in magnitude 
in addition  lyondell s ability to increase product sales prices  and the timing of those increases  are affected by the supply demand balances for its products  as well as the capacity utilization rates for those products 
timing differences in pricing between rising raw material costs  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases  have reduced and may continue to reduce profitability 
further  volatility in costs and pricing 
table of contents can result in commercial disputes with customers and suppliers with respect to interpretations of complex contractual arrangements 
significant adverse resolution of any such disputes also could reduce profitability 
lyondell s international operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  exchange controls  political risks and other risks relating to non us operations 
lyondell has substantial international operations  which are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic instability and disruptions  restrictions on the transfer of funds  the imposition of duties and tariffs  import and export controls  changes in governmental policies  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments 
these events could reduce the demand for lyondell s products internationally  decrease the prices at which it can sell its products internationally or disrupt production or other operations internationally  which could reduce its operating results 
in addition  lyondell obtains a substantial portion of its principal raw materials from sources outside the us  which are subject to these same risks 
although lyondell has compliance programs and processes intended to ensure compliance with applicable customs  currency exchange control regulations  transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which it may be subject  lyondell is subject to the risk that its compliance could be challenged 
furthermore  these laws may be modified  the result of which may be to prevent or limit non us subsidiaries from transferring cash to lyondell 
for geographic data  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  lyondell generates revenue from export sales and operations conducted outside the us that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
future events  which may significantly increase or decrease the risk of future movement in foreign currencies in which it conducts its business  cannot be predicted 
lyondell also may hedge certain revenues and costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to the respective functional currencies 
it is possible that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will result in reduced operating results 
lcr s crude supply agreement with pdvsa oil is important to lcr s operations because it reduces the volatility of earnings and cash flow 
the agreement is subject to the risk of enforcing contracts against non us affiliates of a sovereign nation and force majeure risks 
as discussed earlier in item business refining segment raw materials  lcr is party to a long term crude supply agreement with pdvsa oil  a wholly owned subsidiary of pdvsa  under which lcr purchases most of its crude oil 
there are risks associated with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non us affiliates of a sovereign nation 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of litigation related to the crude supply agreement 
additionally  all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years 
it is impossible to predict how governmental policies may change under the current or any subsequent venezuelan government 
depending on then current market conditions  any modification  breach or termination of the crude supply agreement  or any interruption in this source of crude oil  would require lcr to purchase all or a portion of its crude oil in the merchant market  and could subject lcr to significant volatility and price fluctuations and could adversely affect lcr  and  therefore  lyondell 
see item business refining segment raw materials and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information about the crude supply agreement 
lyondell s and lcr s operations and assets are subject to extensive environmental  health and safety and other laws and regulations  which could result in material costs or liabilities 
lyondell and lcr cannot predict with certainty the extent of future liabilities and costs under environmental  health and safety and other laws and regulations and whether liabilities and costs will be material 

table of contents lyondell and lcr also may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at their facilities or chemicals that they manufacture  handle or own 
in addition  because lyondell s chemical products are components of a variety of other end use products  lyondell  along with other members of the chemical industry  is inherently subject to potential claims related to those end use products 
although claims of the types described above have not historically had a material impact on lyondell s or lcr s operations  a substantial increase in the success of these types of claims could result in the expenditure of a significant amount of cash by lyondell or lcr to pay claims  and could reduce their operating results 
lyondell and lcr together with the industries in which they operate are subject to extensive national  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  and are required to have permits and licenses regulating  emissions to the air  discharges onto land or waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations require lyondell and lcr to meet specific financial responsibility requirements 
lyondell cannot accurately predict future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  and inspection and enforcement policies  as well as higher compliance costs  which might affect the handling  manufacture  use  emission or disposal of products  other materials or hazardous and non hazardous waste 
some risk of environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in lyondell s and lcr s operations and products  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there is no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
in general  however  with respect to the costs and risks described above  lyondell does not expect that it or lcr will be affected differently than the rest of the chemical and refining industries where their facilities are located 
environmental laws may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of contamination at current and former operating facilities  the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater 
also  us superfund statutes may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that generated waste  arranged for disposal of the wastes  transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites 
all such responsible parties or any one of them  including lyondell and lcr may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault  the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site 
in addition  similar environmental laws and regulations that have been or may be enacted in countries outside of the us may impose similar liabilities and costs upon lyondell 
lyondell and lcr have on site solid waste management units at several facilities 
it is anticipated that corrective measures will be necessary to comply with federal and state requirements with respect to these facilities 
lyondell and lcr also have liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and non us government regulations related to several current and former plant sites 
lyondell and lcr also are responsible for a portion of the remediation of certain off site waste disposal facilities 
lyondell and lcr are contributing funds to the cleanup of several waste sites throughout the us under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  including the kalamazoo river superfund site discussed below 
lyondell and lcr also have been named as potentially responsible parties at several other sites 
lyondell s policy is to accrue remediation expenses when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are necessarily imprecise due to such factors as the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties under applicable statutes

if actual expenditures exceed the amounts accrued  that could have an adverse effect on lyondell s results of operations and financial position 
kalamazoo river superfund site lyondell acquired millennium on november  a millennium subsidiary has been identified as a potential responsible party prp with respect to the kalamazoo river superfund site 
the site involves cleanup of river sediments and floodplain soils contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls  cleanup of former paper mill operations  and cleanup and closure of landfills associated with the former paper mill operations 
litigation concerning the matter commenced in december but was subsequently stayed and is being addressed under cercla 
in  the kalamazoo river study group the krsg  of which the millennium subsidiary and other prps are members  submitted to the state of michigan a draft remedial investigation and draft feasibility study  which evaluated a number of remedial options for the river 
the estimated costs for these remedial options ranged from to billion 
at the end of  the us environmental protection agency epa took lead responsibility for the river portion of the site at the request of the state of michigan 
in  the epa initiated a confidential process to facilitate discussions among the agency  the millennium subsidiary  other prps  the michigan departments of environmental quality and natural resources  and certain federal natural resource trustees about the need for additional investigation activities and different possible approaches for addressing the contamination in and along the kalamazoo river 
these discussions are continuing 
as of december   the probable future remediation spending associated with the river cannot be determined with certainty 
although the krsg study identified a broad range of remedial options  not all of those options would represent reasonably possible outcomes 
management does not believe that it can identify a single remedy among those options that would represent the highest cost reasonably possible outcome 
however  lyondell recognized a liability representing millennium s interim allocation of of the million total of estimated cost of bank stabilization  recommended as the preferred remedy in by the krsg study  and of certain other costs 
at december   the balance of this liability  net of related spending  was million 
in addition  lyondell recognized a liability primarily related to millennium s estimated share of remediation costs for two former paper mill sites and associated landfills  which are also part of the kalamazoo river superfund site 
at december   the balance of the liability  net of related spending  was million 
although no final agreement has been reached as to the ultimate remedy for these locations  millennium has begun remediation activity related to these sites 
millennium s ultimate liability for the kalamazoo river superfund site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined  including the ultimate remedy selected  the determination of natural resource damages  the number and financial viability of the other prps  and the determination of the final allocation among the prps 
other regulatory requirements in addition to the matters described above  lyondell and lcr are subject to other material regulatory requirements  including those relating to the shipment or exportation of products 
although lyondell and lcr have compliance programs and other processes intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations  lyondell and lcr are subject to the risk that their compliance with such regulations could be challenged 
non compliance with certain of these regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs  penalties or assessments that could be significant 
legislative and other actions may reduce lyondell s mtbe sales and cause lyondell to produce less profitable alternative gasoline blending components instead  and may cause lcr s revenues to decline due to reduced sales of finished gasoline products 
in the us  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  used in gasoline sold as reformulated fuel in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the 
table of contents presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft led to public concern about the use of mtbe and resulted in the us federal energy policy act of and us state governmental initiatives to reduce the use of mtbe 
the federal energy policy act of  which was enacted in the us in august  does not phase down or ban the use of mtbe 
however  the act eliminates the oxygen standard for reformulated fuels  effective may   and also contains a renewable fuel standard that mandates the use of ethanol in gasoline 
as a result of the elimination of the oxygen standard for reformulated fuels  companies may choose to no longer use mtbe or any other oxygenate 
various us states have banned or are considering banning the use of mtbe 
for example  california  connecticut and new york banned mtbe  effective january  and new jersey banned mtbe  effective january in addition  beginning in  several major oil companies substantially reduced or discontinued the use of mtbe in gasoline produced for california markets and several refiners have indicated their intent to completely discontinue the use of mtbe in the us in addition to decisions by certain refiners and blenders to discontinue use of mtbe  some common carrier pipelines have announced that they will not carry reformulated gasoline containing mtbe beginning as early as march it is not clear whether these actions by pipelines are consistent with regulatory requirements and lyondell is contesting these actions by pipelines 
the combination of these actions is expected to negatively affect us mtbe demand and  therefore  negatively impact lyondell s revenues 
lyondell s north american mtbe business accounted for approximately billion of lyondell s revenues in however  at this time  lyondell cannot predict the full impact that the us federal legislation  state governmental initiatives and bans  and these commercial actions will have on mtbe margins or volumes longer term 
lyondell intends to continue marketing mtbe in the us  as well as outside of the us however  should it become necessary or desirable to significantly reduce mtbe production as a result of state bans or commercial decisions by refiners  blenders and pipelines to discontinue use or transportation of mtbe  lyondell has or will have the flexibility to produce alternative gasoline blending components  such as iso octane  iso octene also known as di isobutylene or etbe 
lyondell is installing equipment at its channelview  texas facility that will provide lyondell with the flexibility to produce either di isobutylene or mtbe at that facility  and this flexibility will be in place in the current estimated cost of converting this facility to di isobutylene production is less than million 
in addition  lyondell s us based and european based mtbe plants can produce etbe and lyondell has produced and sold etbe in europe to address europe s growing demand for biofuels 
conversion and product decisions will be influenced by further regulatory and market developments 
the profit contribution related to the non ether alternative gasoline blending components is likely to be lower than that historically realized on mtbe 
in addition  there likely will be higher distribution costs associated with exporting mtbe outside of the us  and the increased supply of mtbe may reduce profitability of mtbe in these export markets 
in addition  these actions by pipelines are expected to cause lcr to reduce its production and sales of finished gasoline products  which could negatively impact lcr s revenues 
although lcr will offset a portion of these reductions by producing and selling the component products  lcr faces constraints in doing so in the near term and the revenues from sales of component products may not always completely offset the lost revenues related to the decreased sales of finished gasoline products 
proceedings related to the alleged exposure to lead based paints and lead pigments could require millennium to expend material amounts in litigation and settlement costs and judgments 
together with alleged past manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigments for use in paint  millennium has been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings alleging personal injury  property damage  and remediation costs allegedly associated with the use of these products 
the plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities  and seek recovery under a variety of theories  including negligence  failure to warn  breach of warranty  conspiracy  market share liability  fraud  misrepresentation and nuisance 
the majority of these legal proceedings assert unspecified monetary damages in excess of the statutory minimum and  in certain 
table of contents cases  equitable relief such as abatement of lead based paint in buildings 
these legal proceedings are in various trial stages and post dismissal settings  some of which are on appeal 
one legal proceeding relating to lead pigment or paint was tried in on october   the judge in that case declared a mistrial after the jury declared itself deadlocked 
the sole issue before the jury was whether lead pigment in paint in and on rhode island buildings constituted a public nuisance 
the re trial of this case began on november  on february   a jury returned a verdict in favor of the state of rhode island finding that the cumulative presence of lead pigments in paints and coatings on buildings in the state constitutes a public nuisance  that a millennium subsidiary and other defendants either caused or substantially contributed to the creation of the public nuisance  and that those defendants  including the millennium subsidiary  should be ordered to abate the public nuisance 
on february   the judge held that the state could not proceed with its claim for punitive damages 
as a result  the jury was discharged 
there will be further proceedings by the judge to determine the scope of any abatement 
millennium is considering its options  including all appropriate appeals 
while lyondell believes that millennium has valid defenses to all the lead based paint and lead pigment proceedings and is vigorously defending them  litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties 
additional lead based paint and lead pigment litigation may be filed against millennium in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief  and any adverse court rulings or determinations of liability  among other factors  could affect this litigation by encouraging an increase in the number of future claims and proceedings 
in addition  from time to time  legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigment respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn successful court decisions 
lyondell is unable to predict the outcome of lead based paint and lead pigment litigation  the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings  and the effect that any legislation and or administrative regulations may have on millennium and  therefore  lyondell 
in addition  lyondell cannot reasonably estimate the scope or amount of the costs and potential liabilities related to such litigation  or any such legislation and regulations 
thus  any liability millennium incurs with respect to pending or future lead based paint or lead pigment litigation  or any legislation or regulations could  to the extent not covered or reduced by insurance or other recoveries  have a material impact on millennium s and  therefore  lyondell s results of operations 
in addition  lyondell has not accrued any liabilities for judgments or settlements against millennium resulting from lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
see item legal proceedings litigation matters for additional discussion regarding lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
operating problems in the businesses of lyondell and lcr may result in lower operating results 
the occurrence of material operating problems at facilities owned by lyondell and lcr  including  but not limited to  the events described below  may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility  or lyondell as a whole  during and after the period of such operational difficulties 
lyondell s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its and lcr s various production facilities and the ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule 
although lyondell and lcr take precautions to enhance the safety of their operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  their operations  along with the operations of other members of the chemical and refining industries  are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials  products and wastes 
these potential hazards include pipeline leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  severe weather and natural disasters  mechanical failure  
table of contents unscheduled downtimes  supplier disruptions  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  remediation complications  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  storage tank leaks  other environmental risks  and terrorist acts 
some of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
furthermore  lyondell and lcr also will continue to be subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  workers compensation and other matters 
lyondell and lcr maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance that they believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  but they are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to their businesses  including losses resulting from natural disasters  war risks or terrorist acts 
changes in insurance market conditions have caused  and may in the future cause  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and  in some instances  for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if lyondell or lcr were to incur a significant liability for which they were not fully insured  that company might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to it or at all  and might be obligated to divert a significant portion of its cash flow from normal business operations 
shared control of joint ventures may delay decisions or actions regarding the joint ventures and changes in ownership of joint ventures may have an adverse effect on lyondell 
a portion of lyondell s operations are conducted through joint ventures 
lyondell shares control of these joint ventures with third parties 
lyondell s forecasts and plans with respect to these joint ventures assume that its joint venture partners will observe their joint venture obligations 
in the event that any of lyondell s joint venture partners do not observe their joint venture obligations  it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that lyondell would be required to increase its level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans 
as with any such joint venture arrangements  differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters  potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn the business and operations of lyondell 
lyondell or any of the other owners of the joint ventures may transfer control of their joint venture interests or engage in mergers or other business combination transactions that could result in a change in control of lyondell or the joint venture or the other owner 
in many instances  such a transfer would be subject to an obligation to first offer the other owner an opportunity to purchase the interest 
lyondell and the other joint 
table of contents venture owners have discussed  and from time to time may continue to discuss  in connection with their ordinary course dialog regarding the joint ventures or otherwise  transactions that could result in a transfer or modification  directly or indirectly  of their ownership in a joint venture 
lyondell cannot be certain that any of the joint venture owners will not sell  transfer or otherwise modify their ownership interest in a joint venture  whether in a transaction involving unrelated parties and or the other owner 
lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell and citgo cease to individually or collectively hold at least a interest in lcr 
in addition  lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell transfers its ownership interests in lcr to a person other than an affiliate or neither citgo nor any of its affiliates is an owner of lcr 
lyondell pursues acquisitions  dispositions and joint ventures  which may not yield the expected benefits 
lyondell continuously seeks opportunities to generate value through business combinations  purchases and sales of assets and contractual arrangements or joint ventures 
these transactions may be intended to  among other things  result in the realization of synergies  the creation of efficiencies or the generation of cash to reduce debt 
these transactions may be financed by the issuance of equity securities or  to the extent permitted by applicable debt covenants  additional borrowings by lyondell or its joint ventures 
although these transactions may be expected to yield longer term benefits if the expected efficiencies and synergies of the transactions are realized  they could reduce lyondell s operating results in the short term because of the costs associated with such transactions or the benefits of a transaction may not be realized to the extent anticipated 
other transactions may advance future cash flows from some of lyondell s businesses  thereby yielding increased short term liquidity  but consequently resulting in lower cash flows from these operations over the longer term 
risks relating to debt lyondell s consolidated balance sheet is highly leveraged and lyondell s business and future prospects may be limited by its significant amount of debt and other financial obligations 
lyondell s consolidated balance sheet is highly leveraged 
including the debt of millennium and equistar  lyondell s total consolidated debt was approximately billion at december  this debt represented approximately of lyondell s total capitalization 
this debt amount does not include approximately million of debt of lyondell s owned joint venture  lcr  owed to parties other than lyondell as of december  in addition  lyondell has contractual commitments and ongoing pension and post retirement benefit obligations described in contractual and other obligations under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that will require cash contributions in and beyond 
lyondell s level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences on its business and future prospects  including the following lyondell may not be able to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other purposes  less leveraged competitors could have a competitive advantage because they have greater flexibility to utilize their cash flow to improve their operations  and in the event of poor business conditions  lyondell may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions than its competitors 
see the liquidity and capital resources section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion regarding lyondell s ability to pay or refinance its debt 

table of contents lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr each require a significant amount of cash to service their indebtedness  and the ability of each of them to generate cash depends on many factors beyond their control 
due to debt covenant limitations on transferring cash between the entities discussed below in this item a 
risk factors  the ability of each of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr to make payments on and to refinance its respective indebtedness may depend solely upon its individual ability to generate cash 
each of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr is separately responsible for its respective outstanding debt except that million of equistar s debt is guaranteed by lcc 
the businesses of each of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet their respective debt service obligations  future borrowings may not be available under current or future credit facilities of each entity in an amount sufficient to enable each of them to pay their respective indebtedness at or before maturity  and each entity may not be able to refinance its respective indebtedness on reasonable terms  if at all 
factors beyond the control of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr affect the ability of each of them to make these payments and refinancings 
these factors include those discussed elsewhere in this item a 
risk factors section and those listed in the forward looking statements section of this annual report on form k 
further  the ability of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr to fund capital expenditures and working capital depends on the ability of each entity to generate cash and depends on the availability of funds under lines of credit and other liquidity facilities 
if  in the future  sufficient cash is not generated from their respective operations to meet their respective debt service obligations and sufficient funds are not available under lines of credit or other liquidity facilities  lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr each may need to reduce or delay non essential expenditures  such as capital expenditures and research and development efforts 
in addition  these entities may need to refinance debt  obtain additional financing or sell assets  which they may not be able to do on reasonable terms  if at all 
debt and other agreements restrict the ability of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr to take certain actions and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios  failure to comply with these requirements could result in acceleration of debt 
lcc s debt and accounts receivable facility lcc s revolving credit facility  indentures and accounts receivable sales facility contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict  among other things  sale and leaseback transactions  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  dividends  investments  non regulatory capital expenditures  lease payments  certain other payments  joint ventures  affiliate transactions  restrictive agreements  sales of assets and mergers 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that require the maintenance of specified financial ratios the interest coverage ratio as defined at the end of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or most recently before each of the indicated dates below  is required to be equal to or greater than the indicated ratio and on any day during the period commencing with each indicated date below and ending on the date prior to the next succeeding indicated date  the ratio of a senior secured debt as defined at such day  to b adjusted ebitda as defined for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended on or prior to such day  is required to be equal to or less than the ratio set forth below opposite the date commencing such period interest coverage ratio senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda ratio december  march  june  september  and thereafter millennium s debt millennium has a us and an australian revolving credit facility  an australian term loan facility and a uk revolving credit facility 
millennium s facilities and its indentures contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict  among other things  distributions  debt incurrence  lien incurrence  investments  sale and leaseback transactions  certain other payments  sales of assets  affiliate transactions  mergers  domestic 
table of contents accounts receivable securitization transactions  restrictive agreements and issuances of redeemable stock and preferred stock 
pursuant to these provisions  millennium is prohibited from making restricted payments  including paying certain dividends 
other than the uk facility  millennium s facilities also contain covenants that require the maintenance of specified financial ratios the leverage ratio as defined is required to be less than to and the interest coverage ratio as defined for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is required to be equal to or greater than a to for any such period ending before september   and b to for any such period ending on or after september  millennium s uk facility does not require the maintenance of specified financial ratios as long as certain conditions are met 
equistar s debt and accounts receivable facility equistar has an inventory based revolving credit facility and an accounts receivable sales facility 
both of these facilities and equistar s indentures contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict  among other things  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  sales of assets  investments  capital expenditures  certain other payments  affiliate transactions  restrictive agreements and mergers 
equistar s credit facility does not require the maintenance of specified financial ratios as long as certain conditions are met 
some of equistar s indentures require additional interest payments to the note holders if equistar makes distributions when equistar s fixed charge coverage ratio as defined is less than to equistar met this ratio as of december  lcr s debt lcr s term loan facility and revolving credit facility contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict  among other things  lien incurrence  investments  certain other payments  issuances of equity  affiliate transactions  restrictive agreements  sales of assets and mergers 
in addition  the facilities contain covenants that require the maintenance of specified financial ratios the debt to total capitalization ratio as defined is required to be equal to or less than to at the end of any fiscal quarter  the coverage ratio defined generally to be the ratio of the consolidated ebitda as defined for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters to the consolidated interest expense as defined for such fiscal quarters is required to be equal to or greater than to at the end of any fiscal quarter and the senior secured debt to ebitda ratio as defined is required to be equal to or less than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
lcr s owners also have loaned money to lcr 
effects of a breach a breach by lcc  millennium  equistar or lcr of any of the covenants or other requirements in their respective debt instruments could permit that entity s note holders or lenders to declare the outstanding debt under the breached debt instrument due and payable  permit that entity s lenders under that credit facility to terminate future lending commitments and permit acceleration of that entity s other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
the respective debt agreements of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr contain various event of default and cross default provisions 
in particular  certain of the debt agreements include event of default provisions that  under certain circumstances  may be triggered in connection with judgments against the relevant entity unless discharged  stayed or bonded within a specified time period 
furthermore  under specified circumstances  a default under equistar s or millennium s debt instruments would constitute a cross default under lcc s credit facility  which  under specified circumstances  would then constitute a default under lcc s indentures 
it is not likely that lcc  millennium  equistar or lcr  as the case may be  would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
in that event  the breaching entity s lenders could proceed against any assets that secure their debt 
similarly  the breach by lcc or equistar of covenants in their respective accounts receivable sales facilities would permit the counterparties under the facility to terminate further purchases of interests in accounts receivable and to receive all collections from previously sold interests until they had collected on their interests in those receivables  thus reducing the entity s liquidity 
in addition  if lcr were unable to pay its debts as they become due  pdvsa oil would have the right to terminate the crude supply agreement 
see risks relating to the businesses lcr s crude supply agreement with pdvsa oil is important to lcr s operations because it reduces the volatility of earnings and cash flow 
the agreement is subject to the risk of enforcing contracts against non us affiliates of a sovereign nation and force majeure risks above 

table of contents debt covenants limit transfers of cash between lyondell  millennium  equistar and lcr and  as a result  cash flows of millennium  equistar and lcr may not be available to lcc and  conversely  lcc may not be able to provide cash to them 
although equistar and millennium are wholly owned subsidiaries of lyondell  debt covenants limit the ability to transfer cash among lyondell  equistar and millennium 
debt covenants also limit transfers of cash between lyondell and lcr 
one of millennium s indentures prevents it from paying certain dividends to lcc 
this prohibition will continue unless and until millennium s cumulative earnings and its fixed charge coverage ratio reach specified levels 
accordingly  cash flow of millennium currently is not  and in the future may not be  available to lcc to fund lcc s needs  such as servicing lcc s debt  paying its capital expenditures or paying dividends to its shareholders 
some of equistar s indentures require additional interest payments to the note holders if equistar makes distributions when equistar does not meet a specified fixed charge coverage ratio 
equistar met this ratio as of december  in addition  equistar s credit facility and lcr s credit facility prohibit the payment of distributions during any default under their respective facilities 
these provisions may deter or limit the movement of cash from equistar to lyondell and millennium and from lcr to lyondell 
applicable laws may also limit the amounts millennium  equistar and lcr are permitted to pay as distributions on their equity interests 
the ability of lyondell s subsidiaries and joint ventures to distribute cash to lyondell also is dependent upon their economic performance  which is dependent on a variety of factors  including factors described elsewhere in this item a 
risks factors section 
lcc s indentures contain a covenant that prohibits it from making investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures that are not restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures  subject to limited exceptions 
neither millennium nor equistar currently is a restricted subsidiary 
lcc s credit facility also contains a covenant that places limitations on its ability to make investments in joint ventures 
lyondell s flexibility to make investments in lcr  and millennium s flexibility to make investments in equistar  are also limited by other tests 
future borrowings also may contain restrictions on making investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures 
as a result of these limitations  lcc s cash flow may not be available to fund cash needs of millennium  equistar and lcr  such as servicing debt or paying capital expenditures 

table of contents forward looking statements certain of the statements contained in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
forward looking statements can be identified by words such as estimate  believe  expect  anticipate  plan  budget or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
many of these forward looking statements have been based on expectations and assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate 
while management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable  they are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive  regulatory and other risks  contingencies and uncertainties  most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond lyondell s control 
lyondell s or its joint ventures actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to the availability  cost and price volatility of raw materials and utilities  the supply demand balances for lyondell s and its joint ventures products  and the related effects of industry production capacities and operating rates  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  operating interruptions including leaks  explosions  fires  weather related incidents  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  supplier disruptions  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  spills and releases and other environmental risks  uncertainties associated with the us and worldwide economies  including those due to political tensions in the middle east and elsewhere  current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the us and in other countries  terrorist acts and international political unrest  competitive products and pricing pressures  risks of doing business outside the us  including foreign currency fluctuations  legal  tax and environmental proceedings  access to capital markets  technological developments  and lyondell s ability to implement its business strategies 
any of these factors  or a combination of these factors  could materially affect lyondell s or its joint ventures future results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of lyondell s or its joint ventures future performance  and lyondell s or its joint ventures actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements

these factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could affect lyondell and its joint ventures 
use caution and common sense when considering these forward looking statements 
lyondell does not intend to update these statements unless securities laws require it to do so 

table of contents in addition  this report contains summaries of contracts and other documents 
these summaries may not contain all of the information that is important to an investor  and reference is made to the actual contract or document for a more complete understanding of the contract or document involved 
industry and other information the data included or incorporated by reference in this report regarding the chemical industry  product capacity and ranking  including lyondell s capacity positions  the capacity positions of its competitors for certain products and expected rates of demand  is based on independent industry publications  reports from government agencies or other published industry sources and estimates of lyondell or its joint ventures 
these estimates are based on information obtained from customers  distributors  suppliers  trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which lyondell and its joint ventures operate and managements knowledge and experience 
these estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors  including those discussed under item a 
risk factors and forward looking statements 
non gaap financial measures the body of generally accepted accounting principles is commonly referred to as gaap 
for this purpose  a non gaap financial measure is generally defined by the securities and exchange commission as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable us gaap measure 
from time to time lyondell discloses so called non gaap financial measures  primarily ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  as well as proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures 
the non gaap financial measures described herein or in other documents issued by lyondell are not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings  for which management has responsibility 
lyondell sometimes uses ebitda in its communications with investors  financial analysts and the public 
this is because ebitda is perceived as a useful and comparable measure of operating performance and the contributions of operations to liquidity 
for example  interest expense is dependent on the capital structure and credit rating of a company 
however  debt levels  credit ratings and  therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings vary in significance between companies 
similarly  the tax positions of individual companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits  with the result that their effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably 
finally  companies differ in the age and method of acquisition of productive assets  and thus the relative costs of those assets  as well as in the depreciation straight line  accelerated  units of production method  which can result in considerable variability in depreciation and amortization expense between companies 
thus  for comparison purposes  management believes that ebitda can be useful as an objective and comparable measure of operating profitability and the contribution of operations to liquidity because it excludes these elements of earnings that do not provide information about the current operations of existing assets 
accordingly  management believes that disclosure of ebitda can provide useful information to investors  financial analysts and the public in their evaluation of companies operating performance and the contribution of operations to liquidity 
lyondell also sometimes reports adjusted net income loss or adjusted ebitda  excluding specified items that are unusual in nature or are not comparable from period to period and that are included in gaap measures of earnings 
management believes that excluding these items may help investors compare operating performance between two periods 
such adjusted data is always reported with an explanation of the items that are excluded 
lyondell also reports certain proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures that are not consolidated  but are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  in lyondell s financial statements investors only see a single line item investment in a joint venture for the unconsolidated joint 
table of contents ventures in the balance sheet and one line item equity income from a joint venture investment in the income statement 
therefore  investors may not get a complete appreciation of the magnitude of certain operating and financial measures for lyondell and its unconsolidated joint ventures and the scope of their business activities 
management believes that reporting certain proportionate share data may give investors a more complete picture of the size and scope of the operating activities of lyondell and its joint ventures

item legal proceedings litigation matters the company and its joint ventures are  from time to time  defendants in lawsuits  some of which are not covered by insurance 
many of these suits make no specific claim for relief 
although final determination of legal liability and the resulting financial impact with respect to any such litigation cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty  the company does not believe that any ultimate uninsured liability resulting from the legal proceedings in which it or its joint ventures currently are involved directly or indirectly will individually  or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the business or financial position of the company 
however  the adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these suits could have a material impact on lyondell s results of operations for that period  which may be mitigated by contribution or indemnification obligations of co defendants or others  or by any insurance coverage that may be available 
although lyondell and its joint ventures are involved in numerous and varied legal proceedings  a significant portion of their outstanding litigation arose in five contexts claims for personal injury or death allegedly arising out of exposure to the products produced by or located on the premises of the respective entities  claims for personal injury or death  and or property damage allegedly arising out of the generation and disposal of chemical wastes at superfund and other waste disposal sites  claims for personal injury  
table of contents property damage and or air  noise and water pollution allegedly arising out of operations  employment and benefits related claims  and commercial disputes 
lyondell on april   lcc filed a lawsuit against basf corporation basf in the court of common pleas for delaware county  pennsylvania seeking declaratory judgment to resolve a commercial dispute regarding the interpretation of various provisions of a propylene oxide sales contract 
soon thereafter  on april   basf filed a lawsuit against lcc in the superior court of new jersey  morris county asserting various claims relating to alleged breaches of the same propylene oxide sales contract and seeking damages in excess of million 
in september  basf s motion to dismiss the company s declaratory judgment action in pennsylvania was granted  and lcc has decided not to appeal that ruling 
the lawsuit basf filed in new jersey is proceeding 
the parties have been ordered to mediation by the court 
lcc believes that it has valid defenses to all claims and is vigorously defending them 
lcc does not expect the resolution of the claims to result in any material adverse effect on its business  financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
beginning november  several lawsuits styled as class actions on behalf of us purchasers were filed in federal court against lcc and certain other chemical companies alleging violations of us antitrust law in connection with the manufacture and sale of polyether polyols  methylene diphenyl diisocyantate mdi and tdi  and seeking treble damages in an unspecified amount 
the lawsuits have been consolidated by the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation in the united states district court for the district of kansas 
lcc believes that it has valid defenses to all claims and is vigorously defending them 
also  lcc received a document subpoena dated february  from the antitrust division of the us department of justice the doj regarding the manufacture and sale of the above products 
at this time  lcc believes it has not violated any antitrust laws

millennium lyondell s millennium subsidiary has received requests from the staff of the northeast regional office of the securities and exchange commission for the voluntary production of documents in connection with an informal inquiry into the previously disclosed restatement of millennium s financial statements for the years through and for the first quarter of millennium is complying with all such requests received 
together with alleged past manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigments for use in paint  millennium has been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings alleging personal injury  property damage  and remediation costs allegedly associated with the use of these products 
the plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities  and seek recovery under a variety of theories  including negligence  failure to warn  breach of warranty  conspiracy  market share liability  fraud  misrepresentation and nuisance 
the majority of these legal proceedings assert unspecified monetary damages in excess of the statutory minimum and  in certain cases  equitable relief such as abatement of lead based paint in buildings 
legal proceedings relating to lead pigment or paint are in various trial stages and post dismissal settings  some of which are on appeal 
millennium s defense costs to date for lead based paint and lead pigment litigation largely have been covered by insurance 
millennium has not accrued any liabilities for any lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
millennium has insurance policies that potentially provide approximately billion in indemnity coverage for lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
millennium s ability to collect under the indemnity coverage would depend upon  among other things  the resolution of certain potential coverage defenses that the insurers are likely to assert and the solvency of the various insurance carriers that are part of the coverage block at the time of such a request 
as a result of insurance coverage litigation initiated by millennium  an ohio trial court issued a decision in effectively requiring certain insurance carriers to resume paying defense costs in the lead based paint and lead pigment cases 
indemnity coverage was not at issue in the ohio court s decision 
on february   certain lloyd s  london insurance underwriters filed a declaratory judgment action in the supreme court of the state of new york against several of their policyholders  including millennium  contesting 
table of contents their responsibility to provide insurance coverage for all of the lead based paint and lead pigment cases  including the rhode island case discussed below 
in response to this new york action  on march   millennium filed an amended complaint in the ohio case referenced above that revived its ohio state court litigation  seeking  among other relief  a declaratory judgment as to the responsibility of all of its insurance carriers for any judgments or settlements in connection with any lead based paint and lead pigment litigation involving millennium 
in addition  on march   millennium filed a motion to dismiss the new york case referenced above in favor of the pre existing ohio action 
the insurance carriers have in the past and may in the future attempt to deny indemnity coverage if there is ever a settlement or a final  non appealable adverse judgment in any lead based paint or lead pigment case 
after owning the glidden paints business for six months  in  a predecessor of a current subsidiary of millennium sold  through a stock sale  its glidden paints business 
as part of that sale  the seller and purchaser agreed to provide indemnification to each other against certain claims made during the first eight years after the sale  and the purchaser agreed to fully indemnify the seller against such claims made after the eight year period 
with the exception of two cases described below  all pending lead based paint and lead pigment litigation involving millennium  including the rhode island case  was filed after the eight year period 
accordingly  millennium believes that it is entitled to full indemnification from the purchaser against lead based paint and lead pigment cases filed after the eight year period 
the purchaser disputes that it has such an indemnification obligation  and claims that the seller must indemnify it 
to date  millennium s defense costs largely have been covered by insurance 
as millennium has not paid either a settlement or any judgment  its indemnification claims have not been finally resolved 
the only two remaining cases originally filed within the eight year period following the sale of the glidden paints business include as parties a current millennium subsidiary and an alleged predecessor company 
in the first of these two cases  the city of new york et al 
v 
lead industries association  inc  et al  which commenced in the supreme court of the state of new york on june   the new york city housing authority brought an action relating to tens of thousands of public housing units 
all claims in that case have been dropped except for those relating to two housing projects 
the other remaining case  jackson  et al 
v 
the glidden co  et al  which commenced in the court of common pleas  cuyahoga county  ohio  on august   includes two minors as plaintiffs  and was dismissed by summary judgment on january  lyondell believes that millennium has valid defenses to all pending lead based paint and lead pigment proceedings and is vigorously defending them 
however  litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties 
additional lead based paint and lead pigment litigation may be filed against millennium in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief  and any adverse court rulings or determinations of liability  among other factors  could affect the litigation by encouraging an increase in the number of future claims and proceedings 
in addition  from time to time  legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead based paint and lead pigment respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn successful court decisions 
millennium is unable to predict the outcome of lead based paint and lead pigment litigation  the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings  or the effect that any legislation and or administrative regulations may have on millennium 
in addition  management cannot reasonably estimate the scope or amount of the costs and potential liabilities related to such litigation  or any such legislation and regulations 
accordingly  lyondell has not accrued any amounts for such litigation 
legal proceedings related to lead based paint and lead pigments are described below in groups pursuant to their general procedural posture on october   after a trial in which the jury deadlocked  the court in state of rhode island v 
lead industries association  inc  et al 
which commenced in the superior court of providence  rhode island  on october  declared a mistrial 
the sole issue before the jury was whether lead pigment in paint in and on public and private rhode island buildings constituted a public nuisance 
the new trial in this case began on november  on february   a jury returned a verdict in favor of the state of rhode island finding 
table of contents that the cumulative presence of lead pigments in paints and coatings on buildings in the state constitutes a public nuisance  that a millennium subsidiary and other defendants either caused or substantially contributed to the creation of the public nuisance  and that those defendants  including the millennium subsidiary  should be ordered to abate the public nuisance 
on february   the judge held that the state could not proceed with its claim for punitive damages 
as a result  the jury was discharged 
there will be further proceedings by the judge to determine the scope of any abatement 
millennium is considering its options  including all appropriate appeals

lyondell s accrued liability for future environmental remediation costs at current and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled million as of december  the remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years  and not to be concentrated in any single year 
in the opinion of management  there is no material estimable range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require the company to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters

overview general lyondell is a global chemical company that manufactures and markets a variety of basic chemicals and gasoline blending components 
as a result of its acquisition of millennium on november  and lyondell s resulting ownership of millennium and equistar  the operations of millennium and equistar are included in lyondell s consolidated financial statements prospectively from december  prior to the acquisition of millennium  lyondell held an equity investment of in equistar  a joint venture with millennium 
lyondell s operations primarily comprise the ethylene  co products and derivatives ec d segment  the propylene oxide and related products po rp segment  the inorganic chemicals segment and the refining segment  consisting of lyondell s equity investment in lyondell citgo refining lp lcr  a joint venture with citgo petroleum corporation citgo 

table of contents versus in  the chemical industry experienced improved profitability compared to  despite higher crude oil and natural gas prices that pushed up raw material costs for most of the year and the disruptive effects of two major us gulf coast hurricanes 
tight gasoline markets in resulted in higher sales prices and margins for fuel related products  including methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  compared to the already high levels experienced in however  the titanium dioxide tio market experienced weaker demand in compared to the us gulf coast hurricanes  katrina and rita  negatively affected crude oil and natural gas supplies  as well as supplies of other raw materials  contributing to the increases in raw material prices in in addition  hurricane related disruption of rail and pipeline traffic in the gulf coast area negatively affected shipments of raw materials and products 
supply demand balances and prices were affected beginning in september as most gulf coast refiners and producers of chemicals suspended operations in preparation for the hurricanes  with some sustaining major damage as a result of the hurricanes 
lyondell s gulf coast plants experienced only minor hurricane damage  however  lyondell and lcr suspended plant and refinery operations in preparation for hurricane rita  resulting in lost production and higher costs during these higher costs included million of charges for lyondell s exposure to industry losses expected to be underwritten by industry insurance consortia and million of costs incurred in conjunction with suspending and restoring operations  including lyondell s share of costs incurred by lcr 
lcr also experienced problems in restarting the refinery 
neither lyondell nor lcr has recognized  in  any benefits of expected insurance reimbursements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
earnings in reflect pretax charges of million  including million to reduce the carrying value of lyondell s lake charles  louisiana  toluene diisocyanate tdi plant and related assets and million for related decommissioning  severance and other costs as a result of a decision to cease tdi production at the plant 
the decision reflected the facility s poor financial results and lyondell s projections of future plant capital requirements  high energy and raw material costs and low industry capacity utilization rates  which made it commercially impracticable to continue production of tdi at the plant 
hurricane rita contributed to the decision  damaging the plant and contributing to increased energy costs 
in the ec d segment  results reflected higher average product margins compared to  partly offset by the negative effects of hurricane related costs and lower sales volumes 
in the po rp segment  tight gasoline supplies and strong demand in resulted in significantly higher mtbe product margins compared to in addition  higher average sales prices for propylene oxide po and derivatives resulted in higher product margins in compared to these benefits were partly offset by weaker tdi operating results in operating results for the inorganic chemicals segment in  compared to conditions in when the business was not a part of lyondell  benefited from higher sales prices 
however  the benefits of the higher sales prices were substantially offset by the negative effects of weaker demand for tio  which resulted in lower sales volumes  and also by inventory reduction efforts  including reduced plant operating rates that lowered earnings by approximately million 
in  lcr s refining operations were negatively affected by lost production and higher costs related to planned and unplanned outages  including the suspension of operations in preparation for hurricane rita and subsequent problems in restarting 
in addition  higher natural gas prices in negatively affected margins under lcr s crude supply agreement 
versus during  the chemical industry experienced broad based improvement as a stronger global economy led to increased demand and tighter chemical industry supply demand balances compared to in this improved business environment  the industry experienced higher sales volumes and generally higher product margins in compared to 
table of contents lyondell  through its investment in equistar  was able to implement sales price increases for ethylene  ethylene derivatives and co products  such as propylene  benzene and fuels that more than offset the effect of significantly higher raw material and energy costs 
lyondell also was able to implement sales price increases for po and derivatives that more than offset the effect of significant increases in the price of propylene  a key po raw material 
in addition  a stronger domestic gasoline market in resulted in higher margins for mtbe and other fuel related products compared to in  compared to  lcr s refining operations benefited from higher margins on crude oil refining  stronger aromatics markets and higher processing rates for venezuelan heavy  high sulfur crude oil 
the stronger domestic gasoline and diesel markets in resulted in higher product margins for lcr 
benchmark indicators benchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of movement of raw material and energy costs for the ec d segment 
ethylene and its co products are produced from two major raw material groups crude oil based liquids liquids or heavy liquids  including naphthas  condensates  and gas oils  the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices  and natural gas liquids ngls  principally ethane and propane  the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices 
lyondell has the ability to shift its ratio of raw materials used in ethylene production to take advantage of the relative costs of liquids and ngls 
the following table shows the average benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable three year period  as well as benchmark sales prices for ethylene and propylene  which lyondell produces and sells 
propylene is also a key raw material for lyondell s po rp business segment 
the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production is based on cmai s estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in us ethylene production and is subject to revision 
see discussion of the ec d segment s operating results below for additional details 
average benchmark price for the year and percent change versus prior year average percent increase percent increase crude oil dollars per barrel natural gas dollars per million btus weighted average cost of ethylene production cents per pound ethylene cents per pound propylene cents per pound as indicated in the table above  benchmark crude oil prices and natural gas prices continued to increase from to  resulting in successively higher average raw material and energy costs each year 
benchmark sales prices for ethylene and propylene increased in response to the higher raw material and energy costs in and  as well as the improving market conditions 
results of operations lyondell s wholly owned operations prior to the acquisition of millennium comprised the po rp segment 
as a result of the acquisition of millennium on november   lyondell s operating income also includes operations of wholly owned subsidiaries equistar and millennium prospectively from december  prior to the acquisition of millennium  lyondell s activities in the ec d segment were conducted through its investment in equistar  accounted for using the equity method

other sg a expenses decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the decrease in was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense  due to a decrease in lyondell s common stock price  partly offset by the effect on incentive compensation of lyondell s improved operating results 
the increase in reflected higher incentive compensation expense as a result of an increase in lyondell s common stock price coupled with improved operating results 
in process research and development charge as part of the acquisition of millennium  million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased in process research and development ipr d 
accordingly  lyondell s results of operations included a charge of million for the value of the acquired ipr d

lcr s operating results are reviewed in the discussion of the refining segment below 
income tax lyondell s effective income tax rate was compared to in and in the effective income tax rate for reflects benefits from finalization of income tax liabilities relating to prior years  partially offset by higher non us earnings that are effectively taxed at higher rates 
the reduction in the rate that resulted from finalization of certain prior years taxes would not be expected to recur in subsequent years  and the impact of future non us earnings on the tax rate will depend on the amount and timing of such earnings 
the effective income tax rate of reflected benefits that reduced taxes on non us income  including benefits associated with the internal financing of the maasvlakte po sm plant construction 
also in  the impact on the effective tax rate of the nondeductibility of the purchased in process research and development costs resulting from the millennium acquisition was largely offset by the benefit of a reduction in the dutch statutory income tax rate 
the effective income tax rate for represented the tax benefit from operating losses incurred during the year 
the tax benefit exceeded the statutory federal rate due primarily to the benefits of internal financing that reduced taxes on non us income 
net income lyondell had net income of million in and million in  compared to a net loss of million in the following table summarizes the major components contributing to the  and results of operations

the improvement in operating income in compared to was primarily due to higher product margins in the operating results of the segments are reviewed in the segment analysis below 
fourth quarter versus third quarter lyondell had net income of million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter the million increase primarily reflected the 
table of contents third quarter after tax charge of million for the reduction in the carrying value of lyondell s lake charles  louisiana  tdi plant and related assets 
the benefit of higher ec d segment product margins and sales volumes in the fourth quarter was substantially offset by a seasonal decrease in fourth quarter mtbe product margins  lower fourth quarter operating results at lcr due to the unplanned post hurricane outages  and additional charges of million after tax related to the tdi plant 
segment analysis lyondell operates primarily in four reportable segments ec d  po rp  inorganic chemicals and refining 
lyondell s refining operations are conducted through its interest in lcr 
the ec d segment comprises the operations of equistar  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of lyondell with the november  acquisition of millennium  and the acetyls business of millennium 
the po rp segment represents the operations of the former intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment of lyondell  and the inorganic chemicals segment comprises millennium s tio and related products business 
ethylene  co products and derivatives segment overview in its ec d segment  lyondell manufactures and markets ethylene and its co products  primarily propylene  butadiene and aromatics  which include benzene and toluene 
lyondell also manufactures and markets ethylene derivatives  primarily polyethylene including high density polyethylene hdpe  low density polyethylene ldpe and linear low density polyethylene lldpe  ethylene glycol  ethylene oxide and its other derivatives  and ethanol and vinyl acetate monomer vam 
in the ec d segment  lyondell also manufactures and markets fuels  such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and alkylate  as well as acetic acid  methanol and polypropylene 
operations of the millennium acetyls business are included in the ec d segment prospectively from december  acetyls revenues and operating income for were million and million  respectively  and million and million  respectively  for the month of december compared to business conditions in when it was not a part of lyondell  the acetyls business was negatively affected in by higher raw material and energy costs  due to higher ethylene and natural gas prices  and lower sales volumes  resulting from weaker demand 
these negative effects were only partly offset by the benefits of higher average product sales prices 
the following is a review of equistar s operating results for the periods on a stand alone basis 
consequently  it excludes the acetyls business and any effect of lyondell s accounting for its acquisition of millennium and its resultant acquisition of equistar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of lyondell s acquisition of millennium 
equistar s average product margins were higher compared to the benefit of the higher average product margins was partly offset by the negative effects of hurricane related costs and lower sales volumes 
us ethylene industry demand decreased an estimated in compared to  due primarily to the effects of the us gulf coast hurricanes 
during  equistar was able to implement sales price increases in many products that more than offset the effect of significantly higher raw material and energy costs during and  resulting in higher average product margins compared to us ethylene demand grew in compared to 
table of contents the following table sets forth equistar s sales and other operating revenues  operating income and selected product sales volumes 
for the year ended december  millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues operating income loss volumes  in millions ethylene and derivatives pounds polyethylene volumes included in above volumes pounds co products  non aromatic pounds aromatics gallons revenues equistar s revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in the increase in reflected higher average sales prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes 
as noted in the table below  benchmark sales prices for ethylene  propylene and hdpe averaged significantly higher in compared to  while benzene average sales prices in were comparable to ethylene and derivative sales volumes were lower in compared to equistar s revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in  reflecting higher average sales prices and volumes 
benchmark ethylene  propylene and hdpe sales prices averaged significantly higher in compared to  while average benchmark benzene sales prices nearly doubled in compared to ethylene and derivative sales volumes were higher in compared to average benchmark price for the year and percent change versus prior year average percent increase percent increase ethylene cents per pound propylene cents per pound benzene cents per gallon hdpe cents per pound operating income equistar had operating income of million in compared to million in  a increase 
the improvement was primarily the result of higher average product margins 
the benefit of the higher average product margins was partly offset by the negative effects of hurricane related costs and lower sales volumes 
hurricane related costs included million of charges representing equistar s exposure to industry losses expected to be underwritten by industry insurance consortia 
equistar s operating income was million in compared to an operating loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to higher product margins and higher sales volumes in the effect of sales price increases in response to higher raw material and energy costs were generally more favorable in than in  resulting in higher average product margins in operating results in also were negatively impacted by scheduled maintenance turnarounds at two major ethylene plants  a million loss on the sale of a polypropylene plant and an million charge for the write off of a research and development r d facility for derivatives 
fourth quarter versus third quarter lyondell s ec d segment includes  from december   the businesses of equistar and the acetyls business of millennium 
the following is a comparison of lyondell s ec d segment for the fourth quarter to the third quarter 
table of contents ec d segment fourth quarter operating income of million compares to operating income of million in the third quarter the increase in profitability was primarily due to approximately million of higher fourth quarter product margins  reflecting post hurricane supply tightness  which resulted in sales price increases that exceeded increases in raw material and energy costs 
fourth quarter sales volumes for ethylene and derivatives were comparable to the third quarter acetyls fourth quarter operating results declined compared to the third quarter  as higher average sales prices did not fully offset higher natural gas and ethylene costs 
propylene oxide and related products segment overview the po rp segment produces and markets po  po derivatives  such as propylene glycol pg  propylene glycol ethers pge  and butanediol bdo  toluene diisocyanate tdi  styrene and tertiary butyl alcohol tba and its derivatives  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe 
styrene and tba are co products of lyondell s two major po production processes  referred to as po sm and po tba 
operations in and included the operations of the owned maasvlakte po sm plant  which began production in the fourth quarter in  tight gasoline supplies and strong demand resulted in significantly higher mtbe product margins compared to in addition  higher average sales prices for po and derivatives resulted in higher product margins in compared to these benefits were partly offset by weaker tdi operating results in styrene results improved slightly on higher sales volumes 
as a result of improved supply demand balances in  sales price increases for po and derivatives more than offset the effect of significant increases in the price of propylene  resulting in higher product margins compared to during  mtbe sales prices and product margins benefited from a strong gasoline market and high gasoline prices compared to partly offsetting these improvements  tdi and styrene product margins were lower in compared to as sales price increases for these products failed to offset raw material cost increases 
in particular  benchmark prices for raw material benzene in the us were higher compared to  negatively affecting styrene margins 
the maasvlakte po sm plant incurred prestart up expenses during of approximately million  of which lyondell s share was million 
also in  lyondell completed a restructuring of its nihon oxirane joint venture in japan  including the sale of a interest in the joint venture to lyondell s partner for million  resulting in an million gain and reducing lyondell s remaining interest from to 
the following table sets forth the po rp segment s sales and other operating revenues  operating income  product sales volumes and average benchmark market prices for propylene 
for the year ended december  millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues operating income loss volumes  in millions po and derivatives pounds co products sm pounds mtbe and other tba derivatives gallons average benchmark raw material price propylene united states cents per pound europe euros per metric ton 
table of contents the above sales data include processing volumes and purchases for resale 
the purchases for resale reflected in the sales volumes  principally styrene  were substantially replaced in by production volumes from the maasvlakte po sm plant in the netherlands  which began production in the fourth quarter revenues revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher average sales prices  as well as higher overall sales volumes 
sales volumes in compared to increased for mtbe and other tba derivatives  decreased for po and derivatives  and increased for styrene 
revenues of  million in increased compared to revenues of  million in the higher revenues were primarily due to higher average sales prices and higher product sales volumes 
sales volumes for po and derivatives were higher in  reflecting stronger demand compared to sales volumes for co product styrene were higher  while mtbe sales volumes were lower in compared to operating income operating income was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher product margins for mtbe and for po and derivatives in compared to mtbe contributed approximately million and po and derivatives contributed approximately million to the improvement in operating income in these improvements were partly offset by the million of charges related to lyondell s lake charles  louisiana  tdi plant and by tdi operating losses 
operating income was million in compared to an operating loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to higher product margins and sales volumes for po and derivatives and higher mtbe margins 
the higher product margins resulted from increases in sales prices for po and derivatives which more than offset the increase in propylene prices 
these increases in operating income were partly offset by lower product margins for styrene as well as the segment s share of higher sg a expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to the effect of lyondell s higher common stock price and improved performance on incentive compensation expense in fourth quarter versus third quarter the po rp segment had operating income of million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter the million decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower mtbe product margins in the fourth quarter  which were partly offset by the effect of lower charges in the fourth quarter related to lyondell s lake charles  louisiana  tdi plant and charges representing lyondell s po rp segment exposure to industry losses expected to be underwritten by industry insurance consortia 
the seasonal decrease in mtbe product margins was approximately million 
the fourth and third quarters of included charges of million and million  respectively  related to the lake charles  louisiana  tdi plant and charges of million and million  respectively  representing the po rp segment s exposure to industry losses expected to be underwritten by industry insurance consortia 
fourth quarter po and derivatives operating results were comparable to the third quarter as the benefits of higher prices and sales volumes were offset by higher raw material and energy costs  styrene operating results improved approximately million on higher product margins  and  before taking into account the charges related to the lake charles tdi plant shutdown  tdi operating results improved approximately million

table of contents compared to conditions in when the business was not a part of lyondell  operating results for the inorganic chemicals segment in benefited from higher sales prices that were substantially offset by the negative effects of lower sales volumes  higher raw material and energy costs and lyondell s inventory reduction efforts  which included reduced plant operating rates 
the reduced plant operating rates in lowered earnings by approximately million 
sales prices in averaged higher compared to  while sales volumes were lower  despite the positive effect of hurricane related supply disruptions at other tio producers facilities during part of the lower sales volumes compared to reflected weaker demand and millennium s efforts to reduce inventory levels through a strong sales volume push 
fourth quarter versus third quarter lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment includes  from december   the inorganic chemicals business of millennium 
the following is a comparison of lyondell s inorganic chemicals segment for the fourth quarter to the third quarter the inorganic chemicals segment had an operating loss of million in the fourth quarter compared to a million operating loss in the third quarter the third quarter operating results reflected higher costs resulting from reduced plant operating rates as part of lyondell s inventory reduction efforts 
sales price increases in the fourth quarter offset the impact of high natural gas prices in the us and us sales volumes in the quarters were comparable 
refining segment overview lyondell s activities in the refining segment are conducted through its interest in lcr  and the following discussion of lcr s operating results is on a basis

under the csa  lcr purchases  barrels per day of heavy  high sulfur crude oil  which constitutes approximately of its rated crude oil refining capacity of  barrels per day 
lcr generally purchases the balance of its crude oil requirements on the spot market 
profit margins on spot market crude oil tend to be more volatile than margins on csa crude oil 
total crude oil processing rates were  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in csa crude oil processing rates were  barrels per day in   barrels per day and  barrels per day in the lower processing rates in were due to the planned and unplanned outages in during the early part of  a national strike in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela disrupted deliveries of csa crude oil to lcr  resulting in lower csa processing rates in compared to in  lcr s refining operations were negatively affected by lost production and costs resulting from both planned and unplanned maintenance in the second quarter and the suspension of operations in preparation for hurricane rita and related problems in restarting 
lcr is pursuing insurance claims for the effects of the hurricane related business interruption and related costs 
in addition  higher natural gas prices in led to lower csa crude oil margins compared to  as discussed below 
these negative effects were partly offset by benefits from significantly higher spot crude oil margins in  which reflected stronger diesel and gasoline markets in compared to in  lcr benefited from higher csa and spot crude oil margins compared to the higher csa crude oil margins primarily reflected favorable effects in the csa contract formula  resulting from more efficient operations and natural gas prices 
the csa contract pricing formula reflects natural gas prices on a lagged basis and resulted in a more favorable effect on csa crude oil margins compared to the effect in the higher spot crude oil margins reflected the strong gasoline market and high gasoline prices in compared to lcr 
table of contents also benefited from higher aromatics margins in compared to improved aromatics margins reflected significant increases in prices  primarily in the third quarter the following table sets forth lcr s sales and other operating revenues  net income  sales volumes for refined products and crude processing rates for the periods indicated

refined product sales prices averaged higher in than in sales volumes decreased in compared to  reflecting the lower crude processing rates  which decreased as a result of the planned and unplanned outages during revenues were  million in compared to  million in the increase was primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices  which were driven largely by significantly higher crude oil prices in crude processing rates averaged  barrels per day in  increasing from average rates of  barrels per day 
additionally  csa crude processing rates increased  barrels per day from to offset by a  barrel per day decrease in spot market crude processing rates 
net income net income was million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the negative effects of lost production and costs related to the planned and unplanned outages 
in addition  higher natural gas prices in compared to negatively affected csa crude margins 
these negative factors were only partly offset by the benefit of higher margins on spot crude oil volumes 
lcr s net income was million in compared to million in the million improvement in compared to was primarily due to higher margins on both csa and spot crude oil volumes  higher aromatics margins and increased operating reliability and efficiency that led to higher operating rates and reduced costs in higher csa processing rates also contributed to the improvement 
lcr s net income included a million benefit related to a third party contract settlement  partly offset by a million charge for the write off of obsolete equipment 
in addition  lcr s net income in included a million 
table of contents charge related to previously capitalized costs for a low sulfur gasoline project and a million charge related to personnel reductions 
fourth quarter versus third quarter lcr had a net loss of million in the fourth quarter compared to net income of million in the third quarter the decline in operating results was primarily due to the negative effects of lost production and costs related to problems in restarting operations after hurricane rita 
total crude oil processing rates averaged  barrels per day  a decrease of  barrels per day compared to the third quarter and  barrels per day compared to lcr s rated capacity 
results were also negatively impacted by higher natural gas costs in the fourth quarter financial condition the following operating  investing and financing activities reflect the consolidation of millennium and equistar  prospectively from december  operating activities operating activities provided cash of  million in  million in and million in cash flows provided by operating activities in included  million and million  respectively  provided by the operations of equistar and millennium

other changes in assets and liabilities  which used cash of million  reflected expenditures for turnaround maintenance costs and payments of incentive compensation and property taxes 
the net decrease in the main components of working capital of million in was due to a million increase in accounts payable balance that was partly offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventory balances 
the million increase in the accounts payable balance primarily reflected higher purchase prices for raw materials and energy  reflecting the effects of a increase in crude oil prices and a increase in natural gas prices  comparing december  and the million increase in the accounts receivable balance primarily reflected higher average sales prices in compared to inventories increased million due primarily to a slowdown in ec d segment sales late in as noted below under financing activities  in november  lcc and equistar amended the accounts receivable sales facilities

millennium has outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures  which are due in  unless earlier redeemed  converted or repurchased 
as a result of lyondell s acquisition of millennium  the debentures are convertible into shares of lyondell s common stock or  at lyondell s discretion  equivalent cash or a combination thereof 
as of december   based on a quarterly test related to the price of lyondell common stock  the debentures were convertible at a conversion rate of lyondell shares per one thousand dollar principal amount of the debentures

table of contents millennium s option beginning november  at a redemption price equal to of their principal amount or at the option of the debenture holders under certain circumstances 
the debenture redemption terms are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
joint venture debt at december   the outstanding debt of lcr to parties other than lyondell was million 
that debt is not carried on lyondell s balance sheet because lyondell has no obligation with respect to that debt 
the ability of lcr to distribute cash to lyondell may be affected by restrictive covenants in lcr s credit facility 
see lcr liquidity and capital resources below 
effects of a breach a breach by lcc  equistar or millennium of any of the covenants or other requirements in their respective debt instruments could permit that entity s note holders or lenders to declare the outstanding debt under the breached debt instrument due and payable  permit that entity s lenders under that credit facility to terminate future lending commitments and permit acceleration of that entity s other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
the respective debt agreements of lcc  millennium  equistar and lcr contain various event of default and cross default provisions 
in particular  certain of the debt agreements include event of default provisions that  under certain circumstances  may be triggered in connection with judgments against the relevant entity unless discharged  stayed or bonded within a specified time period 
if lcc  equistar or millennium  as the case may be  was unable to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments  its lenders could proceed against any assets that secure their debt 
furthermore  under specified circumstances  a default under equistar s or millennium s debt instruments would constitute a cross default under lcc s credit facility  which  under specified circumstances  would then constitute a default under lcc s indentures 
similarly  the breach by lcc or equistar of covenants in their respective accounts receivable sales facilities would permit the counterparties under the facility to terminate further purchases of interests in accounts receivable and to receive all collections from previously sold interests until they had collected on their interests in those receivables  thus reducing the entity s liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements the securities and exchange commission sec has described various characteristics to identify contractual arrangements that would fall within the sec s definition of off balance sheet arrangements 
lyondell is a party to the following arrangements that have some of those characteristics accounts receivable sales facilities lcc has a million accounts receivable sales facility  and equistar has a million accounts receivable sales facility  both of which mature in november pursuant to the facilities  lyondell sells  through wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiaries  on an ongoing basis and without recourse  interests in pools of domestic accounts receivable to financial institutions participating in the facilities 
lyondell is responsible for servicing the receivables 
the amount of interests in the pools of receivables permitted to be sold is determined by formulae 
the lcc agreement currently permits the sale of up to million of total interest in domestic accounts receivable  which amount would decline by million if lcc s credit facility were fully drawn 
equistar s borrowing base is determined using a formula applied to accounts receivable and inventory balances and is net of a million unused availability requirement 
at december  and  the outstanding amount of receivables sold under both of the facilities was million 
accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets are reduced by the sales of interests in the pools 
the facilities accelerate availability to the business of cash from product sales that otherwise would have been collected over the normal billing and collection cycle 
the availability of the accounts receivable sales facilities provides one element of lyondell s ongoing sources of liquidity and capital resources 
upon termination of the facilities  cash collections related to accounts receivable then in the pools would first be applied to the outstanding interests sold  but lyondell would in no event be required to repurchase such interests 
in november  both accounts receivable sales facilities were amended to extend the maturities to november and the equistar facility was amended to increase the availability to million 
in june  lcc s accounts receivable sales facility was amended to permit the acquisition of millennium

investments in joint ventures where lyondell exerts a certain level of management control  but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues  are accounted for using the equity method 
for the major unconsolidated joint ventures  lcr and  prior to december   equistar  governance is generally based on equal representation from the partners who jointly control certain key management decisions 
these include approval of the strategic plan  capital expenditures and annual budget  issuance of debt and the appointment of executive management of the joint venture 
accordingly  lyondell s investment in lcr and  prior to december   equistar  are carried on the equity method  even though lyondell s ownership percentage exceeds 
long lived assets with respect to long lived assets  key assumptions include the estimates of useful asset lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets  as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets 
such estimates could be significantly modified and or the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  and uncertainties associated with governmental actions  whether regulatory or  in the case of lcr  with respect to the csa 
to reflect economic and market conditions  from time to time lyondell may temporarily idle manufacturing facilities 
assets that are temporarily idled are reviewed for impairment at the time they are idled  and at least annually thereafter 
fixed assets with a net book value of million were temporarily idled as of december  those assets continue to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives 
earnings for included pretax charges of million for a reduction of the carrying value of lyondell s lake charles  louisiana  tdi plant and related assets 
the charges  as well as a decision to cease tdi production at the plant  reflected the facility s poor financial results and lyondell s projections of future plant capital requirements  high energy and raw material costs and low industry capacity utilization rates  which made it commercially impracticable to continue production of tdi at the plant 
hurricane rita contributed to the decision  as it damaged the plant and contributed to increased energy costs 
the net book value of the long lived assets included in lyondell s investment in its other tdi facility  which is operated by rhodia in pont de claix  france is million 
based on current operating profits in the tdi business  as well as estimates of expected future cash flows  the book value of this investment is not believed to be impaired at december  the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million in if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life 
additional information on long lived assets  deferred turnaround costs and related depreciation and amortization appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
lyondell defers the costs of major periodic maintenance and repair activities turnarounds in excess of million  amortizing such costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
during  and  cash expenditures of million  million and million  respectively  were deferred and are being amortized  predominantly over to years 
amortization in  and  of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of acquired businesses 
lyondell evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
as a result of the acquisition of millennium  lyondell recognized an additional billion of goodwill in  and the carrying value of lyondell s goodwill totaled billion at december  the recoverability of lyondell s goodwill is dependent upon the future valuations associated with its reporting units  which could change significantly based upon business performance or other factors 
long term employee benefit costs the costs to lyondell of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
lyondell s assumed discount rate is based on average rates published by moody s and merrill lynch for high quality aa rating ten year fixed income securities 
for the purpose of measuring the us benefit obligations at december   lyondell lowered its assumed discount rate from to  reflecting market interest rates at december  the rate also will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during a further one percentage point reduction in the assumed discount rates would increase lyondell s benefit obligation for pensions and other postretirement benefits by approximately million  and would reduce lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from lyondell s equity investment in lcr  by approximately million 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was for decreasing per year to in and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost  due to limits on lyondell s maximum contribution level under the medical plan 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected long term rate of return on plan assets applied to a market related value of plan assets which  for lyondell  is defined as the market value of assets 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate  and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate  reflecting long term market expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
lyondell s expected long term rate of return on us plan assets of is based on the average level of earnings that its independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time 
the expectation is based on an asset allocation of us equity securities expected return  non us equity securities expected return  and fixed income securities expected return recommended by the advisor  and has been adopted for the plans 
the actual return on plan assets in was 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve 
table of contents optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
based on the market value of plan assets at december   a one percentage point decrease in this assumption for lyondell and lcr would decrease lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from its equity investment in lcr  by approximately million 
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings  rather than the actual earnings or loss 
as a result of asset earnings significantly below the expected return on plan assets rate over the three year period ended december   the level of unrecognized investment losses  together with the net actuarial gains and losses  is million at december  this unrecognized amount  to the extent it exceeds ten percent of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan  will be recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 
this annual amortization charge would be million per year based on the december  unrecognized amount 
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liabilities for environmental remediation costs anticipated expenditures related to investigation and remediation of contaminated sites  which include current and former plant sites and other remediation sites  are accrued when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
only ongoing operating and monitoring costs  the timing of which can be determined with reasonable certainty  are discounted to present value 
future legal costs associated with such matters  which generally are not estimable  are not included in these liabilities 
as of december   lyondell s accrued liability for future environmental remediation costs at current and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled million 
the liabilities for individual sites range from less than million to million  and remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years  and not to be concentrated in any single year 
in the opinion of management  there is no material estimable range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental remediation matters 
accruals for taxes based on income uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex us federal and us tax regulations 
management expects that lyondell s interpretations will prevail 
also  lyondell has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses 
lyondell believes it is more likely than not that the amounts of deferred tax assets in excess of the related valuation reserves will be realized 
further details on lyondell s income taxes appear in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting and reporting changes effective october   lyondell implemented financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  as an obligation that is conditional only as to timing and amount 
lyondell s application of this interpretation had no material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
effective july   lyondell implemented sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to replace the exception to fair value recognition for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with a 
table of contents general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
lyondell s application of sfas no 
had no material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
to better reflect the full cost of employee compensation  lyondell adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options  the preferred method as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the first quarter  using the prospective transition method 
under the prospective transition method  an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees during and thereafter is charged to earnings over the related vesting periods 
this change resulted in after tax charges of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
a primary focus of this statement is accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  such as by the granting of stock options and phantom stock options 
lyondell will be required to apply the provisions of sfas no 
revised in the first quarter upon adoption  a provision of sfas no 
revised will require lyondell to use a non substantive vesting period approach for share based payment transactions that vest when an employee becomes retirement eligible 
the effect will be to accelerate expense recognition compared to the nominal vesting period approach that lyondell currently uses 
assuming the non substantive vesting period approach had been used  compensation expense related to share based payments would have increased less than million in  million in and million in lyondell expects to continue to utilize the black scholes option valuation model for employee stock options 
other provisions of sfas no 
revised may affect the computation and resulting fair value of lyondell s share based payment transactions with employees 
lyondell does not expect application of these provisions to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached consensus on one issue of eitf issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  that inventory purchase and sales transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the effect would be to reduce reported revenues and cost of sales for affected transactions 
the consensus on this issue would apply to transactions entered into beginning in the second quarter lyondell is evaluating the effect of eitf on its consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters various environmental laws and regulations impose substantial requirements upon the operations of lyondell 
lyondell s policy is to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  which include  among others  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the clean air act amendments clean air act 
lyondell does not specifically track all recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
such costs are included in cost of sales 
lyondell s accrued liability for future environmental remediation costs at current and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled million as of december  the remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years  and not to be concentrated in any single year 
in the opinion of management  there is no material estimable range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters 
the liabilities for individual sites range from less than million to million 
the million liability relates to the kalamazoo river superfund site 
see critical accounting policies above and the environmental remediation section of note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of 
table of contents lyondell s liabilities for environmental remediation  including the liability related to the kalamazoo river superfund site 
lyondell also makes capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations 
capital expenditures for regulatory compliance in  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the spending included equistar and millennium for a full year  while the spending included equistar and millennium spending for the month of december capital expenditures by equistar on a basis for regulatory compliance in and were million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures by millennium on a basis for regulatory compliance in and were million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures by lcr on a basis for regulatory compliance in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in capital expenditures in and reflected increased spending on projects related to air emission reductions  low sulfur fuels and  in  wastewater management 
under the clean air act  the eight county houston galveston region was designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the epa 
emission reduction controls must be installed at lcr s refinery and each of lyondell s ten facilities in the houston galveston region prior to november also  under the clean air act  the epa adopted new standards for gasoline that required refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by and ultra low sulfur diesel by the end of lyondell currently estimates that environmentally related capital expenditures at its facilities  including equistar and millennium facilities  will be approximately million in and million in capital spending to comply with environmental regulations at lcr s facilities on a basis is estimated to be approximately million in and million in in the us  public concern about the use of mtbe resulted in us federal and state governmental initiatives to reduce or ban the use of mtbe 
at this time  lyondell cannot predict the full impact that the us federal legislation  state governmental initiatives and bans  and commercial actions will have on mtbe margins or volumes longer term 
lyondell intends to continue marketing mtbe in the us  as well as outside of the us however  should it become necessary or desirable to significantly reduce mtbe production as a result of state bans or commercial decisions by refiners  blenders and pipelines to discontinue use or transportation of mtbe  lyondell has or will have  with minimal additional capital investment  the flexibility to produce alternative gasoline blending components  such as iso octane  iso octene also known as di isobutylene or ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe 
see the mtbe section of note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding these us federal and state initiatives and their potential impact on lyondell 
item a 
disclosure of market risk see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of lyondell s management of commodity price risk  foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
commodity price risk a substantial portion of lyondell s products and raw materials  as well as those of lcr  are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of lyondell s profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
lyondell tries to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
these include entering into multi year processing and sales agreements  moving downstream into derivatives products whose pricing is more stable  utilization of the raw material flexibility of equistar s ethylene plants and the use of the deemed margin feature of the csa at lcr 

table of contents in addition  lyondell selectively uses commodity swap  option  and futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to purchases of natural gas and raw materials  as well as product sales 
market risks created by these derivative instruments and the mark to market valuations of open positions are monitored by management 
during  and  the derivative transactions were not significant compared to lyondell s overall inventory purchases and product sales 
at december  and  the notional amount of outstanding derivatives and the related market risk were not material 
foreign exchange risk lyondell manufactures and markets its products in a number of countries throughout the world and  as a result  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
costs in some countries are incurred  in part  in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
lyondell utilizes forward  swap and option derivative contracts with terms normally lasting less than three months to protect against the adverse effect that exchange rate fluctuations may have on foreign currency denominated trade receivables and trade payables 
these derivatives generally are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
at december   there were no outstanding foreign currency forward  swap or option contracts 
at december   foreign currency forward and swap contracts in the notional amount of million were outstanding 
interest rate risk lyondell had no borrowing outstanding under its variable rate revolving credit facilities at december  and  and its remaining exposure to interest rate risk was minimal 
derivative instruments have been used selectively to manage the ratio of fixed to variable rate debt 
at december  and  there were outstanding interest rate swap agreements in the notional amount of million  which were designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was an obligation of million at december  and million at december   resulting in a decrease in the carrying value of long term debt and the recognition of a corresponding liability 
using sensitivity analysis  the negative impact on the fair value of the obligation at december  would be approximately million  assuming a unfavorable change in the variable interest rates 
at december  and  lcr had variable rate debt of million and million  respectively  excluding the note payable by lcr to lyondell 
lyondell s exposure to interest rate risk at lcr was not material
