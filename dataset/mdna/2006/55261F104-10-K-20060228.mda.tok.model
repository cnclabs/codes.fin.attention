a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

through subsidiaries  m t provides individuals  corporations and other businesses  and institutions with commercial and retail banking services  including loans and deposits  trust  mortgage banking  asset management  insurance and other financial services 
banking activities are largely focused on consumers residing in new york state  pennsylvania  maryland and the district of columbia and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas 
banking services are also provided in delaware  virginia and west virginia  while certain subsidiaries also conduct activities in other states 
the accounting and reporting policies of m t and subsidiaries the company conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the more significant accounting policies are as follows consolidation except as described in note  the consolidated financial statements include m t and all of its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions of consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
the financial statements of m t included in note report investments in subsidiaries under the equity method 
information about some limited purpose entities that are affiliates of the company but are not included in the consolidated financial statements appears in note consolidated statement of cash flows for purposes of this statement  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities are considered cash and cash equivalents 
securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at amounts equal to the cash or other consideration exchanged 
it is generally the company s policy to take possession of collateral pledged to secure agreements to resell 
trading account financial instruments used for trading purposes are stated at fair value 
realized gains and losses and unrealized changes in fair value of financial instruments utilized in trading activities are included in trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income 
investment securities investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and stated at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold such securities to maturity 
investments in other debt securities and equity securities having readily determinable fair values are classified as available for sale and stated at estimated fair value 
except for investment securities for which the company has entered into a related fair value hedge  unrealized gains or losses on investment securities available for sale are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable income taxes 
other securities are stated at cost and include stock of the federal reserve bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of new york 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts for investment securities available for sale and held to maturity are included in interest income 
the cost basis of individual securities is written down to estimated fair value through a charge to earnings when declines in value below amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary 
realized gains and losses on the sales of investment securities are determined using the specific identification method 
m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued loans and leases interest income on loans is accrued on a level yield method 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status and previously accrued interest thereon is charged against income when principal or interest is delinquent days  unless management determines that the loan status clearly warrants other treatment 
loan balances are charged off when it becomes evident that such balances are not fully collectible 
loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized as an interest yield adjustment over the life of the loan 
net deferred fees have been included in unearned discount as a reduction of loans outstanding 
commitments to sell real estate loans are utilized by the company to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of real estate loans held for sale 
hedged real estate loans held for sale are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value  except for value ascribable to that portion of the loans cash flows that are expected to be realized through loan servicing activities 
valuation adjustments made on these loans and commitments are included in mortgage banking revenues 
except for consumer and residential mortgage loans that are considered smaller balance homogenous loans and are evaluated collectively  the company considers a loan to be impaired for purposes of applying statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended  when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days 
impaired loans are classified as either nonaccrual or as loans renegotiated at below market rates 
loans less than days delinquent are deemed to have an insignificant delay in payment and are generally not considered impaired for purposes of applying sfas no 
impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
interest received on impaired loans placed on nonaccrual status is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan or  if principal is considered fully collectible  recognized as interest income 
residual value estimates for commercial leases are generally determined through internal or external reviews of the leased property 
the company reviews commercial lease residual values at least annually and recognizes residual value impairments deemed to be other than temporary 
initial estimates of residual value for automobile leases are recorded based on published industry standards and historical residual value losses incurred relative to the published industry standards 
automobile leases are considered small homogenous leases and  as such  impairments to residual value are determined based on projected residual value losses relative to the initially recorded residual values 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined by management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans  the value of any collateral and  where applicable  the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
sales and securitizations of financial assets transfers of financial assets for which the company has surrendered control of the financial assets are accounted for as sales to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
retained interests in a sale or securitization of financial assets are measured at the date of transfer by allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued transferred and any retained interests based on their relative estimated fair values 
the fair values of retained debt securities are generally determined through reference to independent pricing information 
the fair values of retained servicing rights and any other retained interests are determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with those interests and by reference to market prices for similar assets 
capitalized servicing rights servicing assets purchased or servicing liabilities assumed that are not recognized in connection with the sale or securitization of financial assets are initially measured at fair value 
capitalized servicing assets are included in other assets and amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
to estimate the fair value of servicing rights  the company considers market prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing rights calculated using assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and expense 
such assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing loans  loan default rates  an appropriate discount rate  and prepayment speeds 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing rights  the company stratifies such assets based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying financial instruments that are expected to have the most impact on projected prepayments  cost of servicing and other factors affecting future cash flows associated with the servicing rights 
such factors may include financial asset or loan type  note rate and term 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights for a stratum exceeds estimated fair value 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance 
goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
similar to goodwill  other intangible assets  which include core deposit intangibles  also lack physical substance but  as required by sfas no 
 business combinations  have had portions of the cost of an acquired entity assigned to such assets 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which  in general  requires that goodwill not be amortized  but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  which is either at the same level or one level below an operating segment 
other acquired intangible assets with finite lives  such as core deposit intangibles  are required to be amortized over their estimated lives 
core deposit and other intangible assets are amortized using accelerated methods over estimated useful lives of five to ten years 
the company periodically assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of core deposit and other intangible assets may be impaired 
derivative financial instruments the company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for such agreements  amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreement and the net differential is recorded as an adjustment to interest income or expense of the related asset or liability 
interest rate swap agreements are designated as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges 
in a fair value hedge  the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and changes in the fair values of the hedged items are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss being recognized in current earnings 
the difference between changes in the fair values of interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the company s consolidated statement of income 
in a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s unrealized gain or loss is initially recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately 
the company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans held for sale 
hedged real estate loans held for sale  commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale  and commitments to sell real estate loans are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value 
however  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments  issued by the united states securities and exchange commission  effective april   value ascribable to cash flows that will be realized in connection with loan servicing activities has not been included in the determination of fair value of loans held for sale or commitments to originate loans for sale 
value ascribable to that portion of cash flows is now recognized at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold 
the provisions of sab no 
were applied prospectively as of april  derivative instruments  including financial futures commitments and interest rate swap agreements  that do not satisfy the hedge accounting requirements noted above are recorded at fair value and are generally classified as trading account assets or liabilities with resultant changes in fair value being recognized in trading account and foreign exchange gains in the company s consolidated statement of income 
stock based compensation the company recognizes expense for stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
under sfas no 
 stock based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the stock based grant based on the estimated grant date value of the stock based compensation that is expected to vest 
information on the determination of the estimated value of stock options and stock purchase plan rights used to calculate stock based compensation expense under the provisions of sfas no 
is included in note in implementing the fair value method of accounting described in sfas no 
 the company chose the retroactive restatement method described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
as a result  financial information for all periods includes the expense applicable to all stock based compensation granted to employees after january  effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  an amendment of sfas no 
as required  coincident with the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company will begin accelerating the recognition of compensation costs for stock based awards granted to retirement eligible employees and employees who will become retirement eligible prior to full vesting of the award because the company s incentive compensation plan allows for vesting at the time an employee retires 
through december   stock based compensation granted to such individuals was expensed over the normal vesting period and any m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized at the time an individual employee actually retired 
this change will affect the timing of stock based compensation expense recognition in the company s consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of and each first quarter thereafter  as most of the company s stock based awards are granted in january  but will not affect the value ascribed to stock based compensation granted to employees nor the aggregate amount of stock based compensation expense recognized by the company 
the company estimates that the acceleration of such expense will increase stock based compensation expense by an additional million in the first quarter of and by approximately million for the full year from what would otherwise have been recognized in those periods had the expense recognition not been accelerated 
if not for this required change  the estimated million of stock based compensation expense to be recognized in would have been recognized in through following the normal vesting schedule for stock options granted by the company 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects attributable to differences between the financial statement value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws 
earnings per common share basic earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common shares issuable under deferred compensation arrangements during the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings 
proceeds assumed to have been received on such exercise or conversion are assumed to be used to purchase shares of m t common stock at the average market price during the period  as required by the treasury stock method of accounting 
treasury stock repurchases of shares of m t common stock are recorded at cost as a reduction of stockholders equity 
reissuances of shares of treasury stock are recorded at average cost

during and   and  respectively  of the valuation allowance was reversed because of increases in the market value of certain strata of servicing assets relative to the amortized cost basis of the servicing assets in such strata 
during  a provision for impairment of  was added to the valuation allowance because the carrying value of certain strata of capitalized servicing assets exceeded estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of capitalized servicing assets was approximately million at december  and million at december  in conjunction with the allfirst acquisition  the company obtained capitalized m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued servicing assets of approximately million  comprised primarily of commercial mortgage loan servicing rights 
the fair value of capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets was estimated using weighted average discount rates of and at december  and  respectively  and contemporaneous prepayment assumptions that vary by loan type 
at december  and  the discount rate represented a weighted average option adjusted spread oas of  basis points hundredths of one percent and basis points  respectively  over market implied forward london interbank offered rates 
the estimated market value of capitalized servicing rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods due to changing interest rates and the effect thereof on prepayment speeds 
an discount rate was used to estimate the fair value of capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing rights at december  and with no prepayment assumptions because  in general  the servicing agreements allow the company to share in customer loan prepayment fees and thereby recover the remaining carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights associated with such loan 
the company s ability to realize the carrying value of capitalized commercial mortgage servicing rights is more dependent on the borrowers abilities to repay the underlying loans than on prepayments or changes in interest rates 
the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of capitalized servicing rights at december  and the sensitivity of such value to changes in those assumptions are summarized in the table that follows 
those calculated sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair value of capitalized servicing rights may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein 
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the servicing rights is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities

 the company completed annual goodwill impairment tests as of october   and for purposes of testing for impairment  the company assigned all recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to benefit from past business combinations 
goodwill was generally assigned based on the implied fair value of the acquired goodwill applicable to the benefited reporting units at the time of each respective acquisition 
the implied fair value of the goodwill was determined as the difference between the estimated incremental overall fair value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit as of each respective acquisition date 
to test for goodwill impairment at each evaluation date  the company compared the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts and certain other assets and liabilities assigned to the reporting unit  including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets 
the methodologies used to estimate fair values of reporting units as of the acquisition dates and as of the evaluation dates were similar 
for the company s core customer relationship business reporting units  fair value was estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the company s m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued non relationship business reporting units were individually analyzed and fair value was largely determined by comparisons to market transactions for similar businesses 
based on the results of the goodwill impairment tests  the company concluded that the amount of recorded goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing dates

derivative financial instruments as part of managing interest rate risk  the company has entered into several interest rate swap agreements 
the agreements modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate swap agreements are generally entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and most contain collateral provisions protecting the at risk party 
the company believes that the credit risk inherent in these contracts is not significant 
the company designates interest rate swap agreements utilized in the management of interest rate risk as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges as defined in sfas no 
fair value hedges m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued are intended to protect against exposure to changes in the fair value of designated assets or liabilities

variable interest entities and asset securitizations variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the fasb s stated intent in issuing fin was to clarify the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity as defined in fin if that enterprise has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected returns if they occur  or both 
in december  the fasb issued a revised fin fin r  which attempted to clarify the guidance in the original interpretation 
fin applied to m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued variable interest entities created after january  and to all variable interest entities created prior to february  that were considered to be special purpose entities as defined in fin r as of december  fin r was applicable to all variable interest entities no later than the end of the first reporting period that ended after march  a description of variable interest entities in which the company holds a significant variable interest and the impact of the accounting provisions related to investments in variable interest entities is described below 
m t auto receivables i  llc is a special purpose subsidiary of m t bank formed for the purpose of borrowing million in a revolving asset backed structured borrowing with an unaffiliated conduit lender 
the revolving asset backed structured borrowing is secured by automobile loans and other assets transferred to the special purpose subsidiary by m t bank or other of its subsidiaries that totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the activities of m t auto receivables i  llc are generally restricted to purchasing and owning automobile loans for the purpose of securing this revolving borrowing arrangement 
proceeds from payments on the automobile loans are required to be applied in priority order for fees  principal and interest on the borrowing  and funding the monthly replenishment of loans 
any remaining proceeds are available for distribution to m t bank 
the secured borrowing is prepayable  in whole or in part  at any time and is non recourse to m t bank and the company 
however  of the borrowing can be put back to m t bank upon demand 
the company s maximum incremental exposure to loss resulting from the structure of this borrowing arrangement is generally restricted to the amount that such borrowing is overcollateralized 
management currently estimates no material losses as a result of the pledging of assets and the terms of the borrowing arrangement 
the assets and liabilities of m t auto receivables i  llc have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since november when the revolving structured borrowing arrangement was entered into 
such accounting treatment did not change as a result of the accounting provisions for variable interest entities described above 
as part of the allfirst transaction  m t acquired a variable interest in a trust that holds aib american depositary shares adss for the purpose of satisfying options to purchase such shares granted by allfirst to certain employees 
the trust purchased the aib adss with the proceeds of a loan from allfirst 
the loan to the trust was assumed by m t on the acquisition date 
proceeds from option exercises and any dividends and other earnings on the trust assets are used to repay the loan plus interest 
option holders have no preferential right with respect to the trust assets and the trust assets are subject to the claims of m t s creditors 
the trust has been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since april  as a result  included in investment securities available for sale were  aib adss with a carrying value of approximately million at december   compared with  aib adss with a carrying value of approximately million at december  outstanding options granted to employees who have continued service with m t totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
all outstanding options were fully vested and exercisable at both december  and the options expire at various dates through june m t s maximum exposure to loss is million at december  prior to december   the company included the trusts and allfirst capital trust see note in its consolidated financial statements 
as a result of implementing the new accounting provisions for variable interest entities  as of december  the trusts and allfirst capital trust were removed from the company s consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  at december  and  the company included the junior subordinated debentures payable to the trusts and the floating rate junior subordinated debentures payable to the allfirst asset trust as long term borrowings in its consolidated balance sheet 
prior to december   the company included the preferred capital securities of the trusts and the allfirst capital trust in its consolidated balance sheet as long term borrowings  with accumulated distributions on such securities included in interest expense 
that change in financial statement presentation had no economic impact on the company  had no material or substantive impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  and resulted in the company recognizing million in other assets for its investment in the common securities of the trusts and allfirst asset trust that will be concomitantly repaid to m t by the respective trust from the m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued proceeds of m t s repayment of the junior subordinated debentures associated with preferred capital securities described in note the company has invested as a limited partner in various real estate partnerships that collectively had total assets of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
those partnerships generally construct or acquire properties for which the investing partners are eligible to receive certain federal income tax credits in accordance with government guidelines 
such investments may also provide tax deductible losses to the partners 
the partnership investments also assist the company in achieving its community reinvestment initiatives 
as a limited partner  there is no recourse to the company by creditors of the partnerships 
however  the tax credits that result from the company s investments in such partnerships are generally subject to recapture should a partnership fail to comply with the respective government regulations 
the company s maximum exposure to loss of its investments in such partnerships was million  including million of unfunded commitments  at december  and million  including million of unfunded commitments  at december  management currently estimates that no material losses are probable as a result of the company s involvement with such entities 
in accordance with the accounting provisions for variable interest entities  the partnership entities are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
securitizations in december and  the company securitized approximately million and million  respectively  of one to four family residential mortgage loans in guaranteed mortgage securitizations with fnma 
the company recognized no gain or loss on the transactions as it retained all of the resulting securities and allocated million and million of the carrying value of the loans to capitalized servicing assets in and  respectively 
all of the resulting securities were classified as investment securities available for sale 
the company expects no material credit related losses on the retained securities as a result of the guarantees by fnma 
in  the company transferred approximately million of one to four family residential mortgage loans to manufacturers and traders trust company mortgage trust m t trust  a qualified special purpose trust  in a non recourse securitization transaction 
the company received million in cash and retained approximately of the resulting securities in exchange for the loans 
the company realized a million gain on the transaction and allocated million and million of the carrying value of the loans to the retained securities and to capitalized servicing assets  respectively 
all of the retained securities were classified as investment securities available for sale 
in a similar non recourse securitization transaction in  the company transferred approximately billion of one to four family residential mortgage loans to manufacturers and traders trust company mortgage trust m t trust  a qualified special purpose trust 
the company retained approximately of the resulting securities as well as the right to service those loans 
all of the retained securities were classified as investment securities available for sale 
as qualified special purpose trusts  neither m t trust nor m t trust are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
because the transactions were non recourse  the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its association with the trusts is limited to realizing the carrying value of the retained securities and servicing rights 
the combined outstanding principal amount of mortgage backed securities issued by m t trust and m t trust was million at december  and billion at december  the principal amount of such securities held by the company was million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  loans of the trusts that were or more days delinquent totaled million and million  respectively 
credit losses  net of recoveries  for the trusts in and were insignificant 
the company did not repurchase any delinquent or m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued foreclosed loans from the trusts in or certain cash flows between the company and the two trusts were as follows year ended december in thousands principal and interest payments on retained securities servicing fees received a summary of the fair values of retained subordinated interests resulting from the company s residential mortgage loan securitization activities follows 
although the estimated fair values of the retained subordinated interests were obtained from independent pricing sources  the company has modeled the sensitivity of such fair values to changes in certain assumptions as summarized in the table below 
these calculated sensitivities are hypothetical and actual changes in the fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein 
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair values is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
the changes in assumptions are presumed to be instantaneous 
the hypothetical effect of adverse changes on the company s retained capitalized servicing assets at december  is included in note weighted weighted annual average average expected fair prepayment discount credit value speed rate defaults dollars in thousands retained subordinated interests as of securitization date as of december  impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change the subordinated retained securities do not have pro rata participation in loan principal prepayments for the first seven years of the securitization 
the assumed weighted average discount rate is basis points higher than the weighted average coupon of the underlying mortgage loans at december  fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments 
fair value is generally defined as the price a willing buyer and a willing seller would exchange for a financial instrument in other than a distressed sale situation 
with the exception of marketable securities  certain off balance sheet financial instruments and one to four family residential mortgage loans originated for sale  the company s financial instruments are not readily marketable and market prices do not exist 
the company  in attempting to comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 has not attempted to market its financial instruments to potential buyers  if any exist 
since negotiated prices in illiquid markets depend greatly upon the then present motivations of the buyer and seller  it is reasonable to assume that actual sales prices could vary widely from any estimate of fair value made without the benefit of negotiations 
additionally  changes in market interest rates can dramatically impact the value of financial instruments in a short period of time 
the estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt and equity securities were calculated based on quoted market prices at the respective year end 
in determining amounts to present for other financial instruments  the company generally used calculations based upon discounted cash flows of the related financial instruments or assigned some other amount as required by sfas no 
additional information about the assumptions and calculations utilized is presented below 
m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued the carrying amounts and calculated estimates for financial instrument assets liabilities are presented in the following table 
december  december  carrying calculated carrying calculated amount estimate amount estimate in thousands financial assets cash and due from banks money market assets investment securities commercial loans and leases commercial real estate loans residential real estate loans consumer loans and leases allowance for credit losses accrued interest receivable financial liabilities noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits and now accounts time deposits deposits at foreign office short term borrowings long term borrowings accrued interest payable trading account liabilities other financial instruments commitments to originate real estate loans for sale commitments to sell real estate loans other credit related commitments interest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management the following assumptions and methods or calculations were used in determining the disclosed value of financial instruments 
cash and due from banks  money market assets  short term borrowings  accrued interest receivable  accrued interest payable and trading account liabilities due to the nature of cash and due from banks and the near maturity of money market assets  short term borrowings  accrued interest receivable  accrued interest payable and trading account liabilities  the company estimated that the carrying amount of such instruments approximated estimated fair value 
m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued investment securities estimated fair values of investments in readily marketable debt and equity securities were based on quoted market prices 
investment securities that were not readily marketable were assigned amounts based on estimates provided by brokers  discounted calculations of projected cash flows or  in the case of other investment securities  which include capital stock of the federal reserve bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of new york  at an amount equal to the carrying amount 
loans and leases in general  discount rates used to calculate values for loan products were based on the company s pricing at the respective year end 
a higher discount rate was assumed with respect to estimated cash flows associated with nonaccrual loans 
the allowance for credit losses represents the company s assessment of the overall level of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the respective year end and may not be indicative of the credit related discount that a purchaser of the company s loans and leases would seek 
deposits sfas no 
requires that the estimated fair value ascribed to noninterest bearing deposits  savings deposits and now accounts be established at carrying value because of the customers ability to withdraw funds immediately 
time deposit accounts are required to be revalued based upon prevailing market interest rates for similar maturity instruments 
as a result  amounts assigned to time deposits were based on discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing market interest rates for deposits with comparable remaining terms to maturity 
the company believes that deposit accounts have a value greater than that prescribed by sfas no 
the company feels  however  that the value associated with these deposits is greatly influenced by characteristics of the buyer  such as the ability to reduce the costs of servicing the deposits and deposit attrition which often occurs following an acquisition 
accordingly  estimating the fair value of deposits with any degree of certainty is not practical 
long term borrowings the amounts assigned to long term borrowings were based on quoted market prices  when available  or were based on discounted cash flow calculations using prevailing market interest rates for borrowings of similar terms 
trading account assets and liabilities trading account assets and liabilities are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value which  in general  is based on quoted market prices 
trading account assets are included in money market assets and totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
trading account liabilities are included in other liabilities and totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans as described in note  the company enters into various commitments to originate real estate loans for sale and commitments to sell real estate loans 
such commitments are considered to be derivative financial instruments and  therefore  are carried at estimated fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values of such commitments were generally calculated based on quoted market prices for commitments to sell real estate loans to certain government sponsored entities and other parties 
interest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management the estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management represents the amount the company would have expected to receive or pay to terminate such agreements 
m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued other commitments and contingencies as described in note  in the normal course of business  various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding  such as loan commitments  credit guarantees and letters of credit 
the company s pricing of such financial instruments is based largely on credit quality and relationship  probability of funding and other requirements 
loan commitments often have fixed expiration dates and contain termination and other clauses which provide for relief from funding in the event of significant deterioration in the credit quality of the customer 
the rates and terms of the company s loan commitments  credit guarantees and letters of credit are competitive with other financial institutions operating in markets served by the company 
the company believes that the carrying amounts  which are included in other liabilities  are reasonable estimates of the fair value of these financial instruments 
the company does not believe that the estimated information presented herein is representative of the earnings power or value of the company 
the preceding analysis  which is inherently limited in depicting fair value  also does not consider any value associated with existing customer relationships nor the ability of the company to create value through loan origination  deposit gathering or fee generating activities 
many of the estimates presented herein are based upon the use of highly subjective information and assumptions and  accordingly  the results may not be precise 
management believes that fair value estimates may not be comparable between financial institutions due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made 
furthermore  because the disclosed fair value amounts were estimated as of the balance sheet date  the amounts actually realized or paid upon maturity or settlement of the various financial instruments could be significantly different 
commitments and contingencies in the normal course of business  various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding 
the following table presents the company s significant commitments 
certain of these commitments are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
december in thousands commitments to extend credit home equity lines of credit commercial real estate loans to be sold other commercial real estate and construction residential real estate loans to be sold other residential real estate commercial and other standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts commitments to sell real estate loans commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party  whereas commercial letters of credit are issued to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being funded when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and third party 
the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is essentially m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and is subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are oftentimes similar to standby letters of credit and include mandatory purchase agreements issued to ensure that customer obligations are fulfilled  recourse obligations associated with sold loans  and other guarantees of customer performance or compliance with designated rules and regulations 
included in financial guarantees and indemnification contracts are loan principal amounts sold with recourse in conjunction with the company s involvement in the fnma dus program 
under this program  the company s maximum credit risk associated with loans sold with recourse at december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
those recourse amounts were approximately equal to one third of each sold loan s outstanding principal balance 
since many loan commitments  standby letters of credit  and guarantees and indemnification contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part  the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows 
the company utilizes commitments to sell real estate loans to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of real estate loans held for sale 
such commitments are considered derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
and along with commitments to originate real estate loans to be held for sale and hedged real estate loans held for sale are now generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value 
however  in accordance with sab no 
 effective april   value ascribable to cash flows that will be realized in connection with loan servicing activities has not been included in the determination of fair value of loans held for sale or commitments to originate loans for sale 
value ascribable to that portion of cash flows is now recognized at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold 
additional information about such derivative financial instruments is included in note the company occupies certain banking offices and uses certain equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates over the next years 
minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are summarized in the following table in thousands year ending december later years the company entered into an agreement in with the baltimore ravens of the national football league whereby the company obtained the naming rights to a football stadium in baltimore  maryland for a fifteen year term 
under the agreement  the company paid million in both and  million in  and is obligated to pay million per year from through and million per year from through m t and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted 
management  after consultation with legal counsel  does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of litigation pending against m t or its subsidiaries will be material to the company s consolidated financial position  but at the present time is not in a position to determine whether such litigation will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations in any future reporting period 
m t bank corporation and subsidiaries notes to financial statements continued segment information in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  reportable segments have been determined based upon the company s internal profitability reporting system  which is organized by strategic business units 
certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services  the type of customer and the distribution of those products and services are similar 
the reportable segments are commercial banking  commercial real estate  discretionary portfolio  residential mortgage banking and retail banking 
the financial information of the company s segments has been compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note with certain exceptions 
the more significant of these exceptions are described herein 
the company allocates interest income or interest expense using a methodology that charges users of funds assets interest expense and credits providers of funds liabilities with income based on the maturity  prepayment and or repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities 
the net effect of this allocation is recorded in the all other category 
a provision for credit losses is allocated to segments in an amount based largely on actual net charge offs incurred by the segment during the period plus or minus an amount necessary to adjust the segment s allowance for credit losses due to changes in loan balances 
in contrast  the level of the consolidated provision for credit losses is determined using the methodologies described in note to assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
indirect fixed and variable expenses incurred by certain centralized support areas are allocated to segments based on actual usage for example  volume measurements and other criteria 
certain types of administrative expenses and bankwide expense accruals including amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets are generally not allocated to segments 
income taxes are allocated to segments based on the company s marginal statutory tax rate adjusted for any tax exempt income or non deductible expenses 
equity is allocated to the segments based on regulatory capital requirements and in proportion to an assessment of the inherent risks associated with the business of the segment including interest  credit and operating risk 
the management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and  unlike financial accounting  are not based on authoritative guidance similar to generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  reported segment results are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions 
furthermore  changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data
