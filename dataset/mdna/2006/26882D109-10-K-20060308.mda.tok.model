item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s overview we are a provider of technology based solutions for the legal and fiduciary services industries 
our products and services assist clients with the administration of complex legal proceedings  including electronic litigation discovery  bankruptcy administration and class action administration 
we have two operating segments case management and document management 
our case management segment generates revenue primarily through integrated technology based products and services that support client engagements for electronic litigation discovery  class action and mass tort  and bankruptcy proceedings that can last several years and has a revenue profile that typically includes a recurring component 
our document management segment generates revenue primarily through legal noticing services  reimbursement for costs incurred related to postage on mailing services  media campaign and advertising management and document custody services 
document management revenue is generally less recurring due to the unpredictable nature of the frequency  timing  and magnitude of the clients business requirements 
the number of new bankruptcy filings each year may vary based on the level of consumer and business debt  the general economy  interest rate levels and other factors 
for the government fiscal years ended september    and  the administrative office of the us courts reported approximately million  million  and million new bankruptcy filings  respectively 
we believe an important indicator of future bankruptcy filings is the level of consumer and business debt outstanding 
the most recent available federal reserve flow of funds accounts of the united states  dated december   reported increases in both consumer and business debt outstanding as compared with the same period of the prior year 
during  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer aligned with our long term strategic objectives and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
accordingly  our infrastructure software results for and  including our gain on disposition of the infrastructure software business  are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the past several years 
in january  we acquired bsi to expand our offerings to include an integrated solution of a proprietary technology platform and professional services for corporate restructurings 
in january  we acquired poorman douglas and expanded our product and service offerings to include class action  mass tort  and other similar legal proceedings 
in october  we acquired hilsoft to enhance our ability to provide specialized media placement services related to class action  mass tort and bankruptcy noticing 
in november  we acquired nmatrix to expand our product and service offerings to include electronic litigation discovery 
in conjunction with our acquisition of nmatrix  we had notable changes to our capital structure 
as partial purchase price consideration  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock 
to provide us with increased financial flexibility  we also restructured our credit facility 
our amended credit facility now consists of a million senior term loan  due september  and a million senior revolving loan  due november during the term of the loan we have the right  subject to compliance with our covenants  to increase the senior revolving loan to million 
critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  business combinations  goodwill  and identifiable intangible assets to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition 
we have agreements with customers obligating us to deliver various products and services each month 
case management fees earned are contingent upon the month to month delivery of the products and services defined by the contracts and are related primarily to the size and complexity of the ongoing engagement 
the formula based fees earned each month become fixed and determinable on a monthly basis as a result of our completion of all contractually required performance obligations related to products delivered and services rendered by us during the month 
our case management business also provides hosting access  revenue related to hosting access is recognized over the period that service is provided 
document management revenues are recognized in the period the services are provided 
payments received in advance of satisfaction of the related revenue recognition criteria are recognized as a deferred revenue liability until all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
significant sources of revenue include a monthly fee from financial institutions based on a percentage of total liquidated assets on deposit and on the number of trustees  fees for database conversions  database hosting  processing  storage  maintenance and software upgrades  monthly revenue based on the number of cases in a database  fees based on the number of claims in a case  fees for media placement  and fees for services  including technology services  claims reconciliation  document printing  noticing  balloting  voting tabulation and other professional services 
business combination accounting 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized on a straight line basis over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets range from one to years 
goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill 
we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment as of each july and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
during november  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer aligned with our long term strategic objectives and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million related to goodwill during the year ended december  the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  then we will recognize an impairment charge 
if goodwill on our balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our unimpaired  recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  identifiable intangible assets 
each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each identifiable intangible asset 
if events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
furthermore  information developed during our annual assessment  or other events and circumstances  may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable and its fair value is less than the identifiable intangible asset s carrying value and would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
during november  we determined that our infrastructure software segment was no longer aligned with our long term strategic objectives and we developed a plan to sell this segment within a year 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million related to identifiable intangible assets during the year ended december  a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  consolidated results revenue total revenue of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate increase compared with million of revenue for the prior year 
total revenue includes revenue from reimbursed expenses  which are presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of income 
while revenues from reimbursed expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our operating income as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
revenue exclusive of revenue related to reimbursed expenses  which we refer to as operating revenue  increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
changes in direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization are directly related to a segment and are discussed below 
corporate administrative costs not attributable to segment operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the increase in the scope and complexity of our business  and is primarily the result of increases in compensation and related expenses  travel  professional services and software amortization expense 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
all identifiable intangible assets are directly related to a segment and changes in amortization of identifiable intangible assets by segment are discussed below 
acquisition related expenses of million for the year ended december  and million for the prior year result from non capitalized expenses for executive bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel incurred in connection with potential and completed transactions 
expenses related to financing net expenses related to financing decreased million  to million for the year ended december  compared with million of net expenses related to financing for the prior year 
this decrease related to various financing components 
variable interest expense related to our credit facilities and fixed interest expense related to our convertible debt increased million to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in our variable interest rate  partly offset by a decrease in weighted average borrowings outstanding during the year 
amortization of loan fees related to our credit facilities and our convertible debt offering decreased million to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily a result of amortization related to a short term subordinated borrowing under the credit facility used to finance the acquisition of poorman douglas in january all fees related to this subordinated borrowing were amortized during during  we replaced the senior portion of the credit facility used to finance the poorman douglas transaction with our keybank credit facility 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recognized a million charge for the write off of loan fees related to the terminated credit facility 
our convertible debt facility includes a provision allowing the convertible debt holders to extend the debt maturity from three years to six years 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  this provision is accounted for as an embedded option 
at inception  the embedded option was valued at million and the convertible debt balance was reduced by the same amount 
the convertible debt accretes approximately million each quarter such that  at the end of three years  the convertible debt balance will total million 
the embedded option must be revalued at each period end based on the probability weighted discounted cash flows related to the additional interest rate payments which would be made if the convertible debt maturity is extended an additional three years 
while the changes in fair value of the embedded option and carrying value of the convertible debt do not affect our current cash flow  the aggregate of these changes in value is accounted for as a current income or expense item and is included on our accompanying consolidated statements of income as a component of interest expense 
during the year ended december   we recognized expense related to the convertible debt accretion and change in value of the embedded option of million  compared with million of such expense in the prior year 
if the embedded option is eventually exercised  the value assigned to the embedded option will be amortized to income as a reduction to our convertible debt interest expense over the periods payments are made 
if the option is not exercised by some or all convertible debt holders  any remaining related value assigned to the embedded option will be recognized as a gain during that period 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate related to income from continuing operations decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in our effective tax rate compared to the prior year is the result of discrete events  and we anticipate that our future tax rate will increase 
our tax rate is higher than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to state taxes 
two of our subsidiaries  bsi and the recently acquired nmatrix  operate primarily in new york city and are subject to state and local new york tax rates  which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
business segments revenue case management operating revenue increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  nmatrix  which was acquired on november   accounted for approximately million of the increase in operating revenue 
operating revenue exclusive of nmatrix increased million  or approximately 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in class action operating revenues resulting from the timing of several large cases and the expansion of our corporate restructuring professional service offerings  partly offset by a decrease in our trustee professional services 
during february  we entered into a new pricing arrangement with our primary chapter depository financial institution 
this new pricing arrangement will be effective beginning october chapter depository fees are included entirely within our case management segment 
under this arrangement  the fees we earn for deposits placed with this financial institution could have  within certain limits  variability based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
based on the terms of the pricing arrangement and the current interest rate environment  we do not anticipate that this new pricing arrangement will have a material impact on our revenues or earnings 
document management operating revenue decreased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in advertising services 
our advertising services are primarily connected with class action and bankruptcy customers for whom we provide case administration services 
advertising services provided varies significantly depending on the characteristics of the case 
hilsoft  which we acquired in october  provides advertising services independent of case management 
as a result  we believe that the level of advertising services will increase in future periods from the level of advertising services provided during the year ended december  document management revenue for reimbursed expenses of million for the year ended december  increased approximately compared with the same period in the prior year 
revenue for reimbursed expenses have little or no margin and  accordingly  this increase in revenue for reimbursed expenses did not have a material effect on our income from operations 
document management revenues  including revenues related to advertising services  can fluctuate materially from period to period based on clients business requirements 
operating expenses case management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
nmatrix  which was acquired on november   accounted for approximately million of the increase in direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization 
exclusive of nmatrix  direct and administrative expenses  including depreciation and software amortization  increased by million  or approximately 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in reimbursed expenses and expenses related to the expansion of our bankruptcy service offerings 
our case management cost structure is relatively stable and generally does not fluctuate materially with changes in operating revenues 
document management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease primarily results from a decrease in cost of advertising  related to the decline in advertising service revenue discussed above  partly offset by an increase in reimbursed expenses  the inclusion of hilsoft operating expenses  and an increase in expenses paid to third parties for production services 
our document management cost structure is more variable than case management and will fluctuate based on document management business requirements delivered 
both the case management and document management segments have identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of case management s identifiable intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets acquired in the bsi acquisition that became fully amortized during  largely offset by an increase in amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the nmatrix acquisition 
amortization of document management s identifiable intangible assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets acquired in the bsi acquisition that became fully amortized during  partly offset by an increase in amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the hilsoft acquisition 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the total identified intangible assets  the scheduled amortization expense and the scheduled amortization periods for intangible assets acquired through the nmatrix  hilsoft  poorman douglas and bsi acquisitions 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  consolidated results revenue total revenue of million for the year ended december  represents an approximate increase compared with million of revenue for the same period in the prior year 
with our acquisition of poorman douglas in january  revenue related to reimbursed expenses  such as postage pertaining to document management services  increased significantly 
we reflect the revenue from these reimbursed expenses as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of income 
while revenues from reimbursed expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period  these fluctuations have a minimal effect on our operating income as we realize little or no margin from this revenue 
revenue exclusive of revenue related to reimbursed expenses  which we refer to as operating revenue  increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
all revenue is directly related to a segment and changes in revenue by segment are discussed below 
operating expenses direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the inclusion of poorman douglas expenses subsequent to the acquisition date 
as a result of the poorman douglas acquisition  we realized a higher ratio of document management revenue relative to case management revenue than during the same period in the prior year  which resulted in an increase in reimbursed expenses 
in addition  corporate administrative costs not attributable to segment operations increased primarily due to significant increased expenses related to compliance with regulations and standards imposed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  increased amortization expense primarily resulting from our acquisition of additional operating software licenses  increased travel expense primarily related to additional locations  and increased insurance coverage due to business expansion 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
all identifiable intangible assets are directly related to a segment and changes in amortization of identifiable intangible assets by segment are discussed below 
acquisition related expenses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  result from non capitalized expenses for executive bonuses  legal  accounting and valuation services  and travel incurred in connection with potential and completed transactions 
expenses related to financing expenses related to financing totaled million during the year ended december  compared with million of interest income during the same period in the prior year 
this increase related to various financing components 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million charge for the write off of loan fees related to a credit facility we terminated 
variable interest expense related to our credit facilities  fixed interest expense related to our convertible debt  and interest accreted on debt with no stated interest rate totaled million during the year ended december  amortization of loan fees related to our credit facilities and related to our convertible debt offering totaled million during the year ended december  our convertible debt facility includes a provision allowing the convertible debt holders to extend the debt maturity from three years to six years 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  this provision is accounted for as an embedded option 
at inception  the embedded option was valued at million and the convertible debt balance was reduced by the same amount 
the convertible debt accretes approximately million each quarter such that  at the end of three years  the convertible debt balance will total million 
the embedded option must be revalued at each period end based on the probability weighted discounted cash flows related to the additional interest rate payments which would be made if the convertible debt maturity is extended an additional three years 
while the changes in fair value of the embedded option and carrying value of the convertible debt do not affect our current cash flow  the aggregate of these changes in value  totaling million of expense for the year ended december   is accounted for as a current income or expense item and is included on our accompanying consolidated statements of income as a component of interest expense 
if the embedded option is eventually exercised  the value assigned to the embedded option will be amortized to income as a reduction to our convertible debt interest expense over the periods payments are made 
if the option is not exercised by some or all convertible debt holders  any remaining related value assigned to the embedded option will be recognized as a gain during that period 
effective tax rate our effective tax rate related to income from continuing operations increased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  our tax rate is higher than the statutory federal rate of primarily due to state taxes 
our corporate restructuring subsidiary  bsi  operates primarily in new york city and is subject to state and local new york tax rates  which are higher than the tax rates assessed by other jurisdictions where we operate 
discontinued operations our infrastructure software results are included entirely within the discontinued operations section of our income statement 
pre tax income from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from our gain on sale of the business  partly offset by operating losses through the date of sale  which was april  pre tax loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  was primarily the result of a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill  other intangible assets  software and other long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
business segments revenue case management operating revenue increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase is a result of the inclusion of operating revenue related to the poorman douglas acquisition subsequent to the acquisition date 
exclusive of poorman douglas operating revenue  operating revenue declined by million due primarily to a decrease in non recurring bankruptcy case management professional service revenue  partly offset by an increase in bankruptcy deposit based revenue 
document management operating revenue increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  document management revenue for reimbursed expenses of million for the year ended december  increased approximately compared with the same period in the prior year 
the increases in both operating revenue and reimbursed revenue for the document management segment were primarily the result of the acquisition of poorman douglas 
exclusive of poorman douglas revenue  our document management operating revenue declined million due primarily to a decrease in bankruptcy noticing services 
document management revenues can fluctuate materially from period to period based on clients business requirements 
operating expenses case management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the inclusion of poorman douglas expenses subsequent to the acquisition date 
exclusive of poorman douglas expenses  case management s direct and administrative expenses  including depreciation and software amortization  increased million due primarily to increases in operating software amortization and wage related expense 
our case management cost structure is relatively stable and generally does not fluctuate materially with changes in operating revenues 
document management direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and software amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
this increase primarily results from the inclusion of poorman douglas expenses  including reimbursed expenses  subsequent to the acquisition date 
exclusive of poorman douglas expenses  our document management expenses declined million due primarily to a decline in postage and print expense related to a decrease in noticing services 
our document management cost structure is more variable than case management and will fluctuate based on document management business requirements delivered 
both the case management and document management segments have identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of case management s identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
amortization of document management s identifiable intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the prior year 
for both segments  this increase is due primarily to the amortization expense related to the acquired intangible assets resulting from the poorman douglas transaction and the february commencement of amortization related to the bsi trade name 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year ended december   our operating activities provided net cash of million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities were net income of million and adjustments for non cash charges and credits  primarily depreciation and amortization  of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities as a direct result of assets acquired or liabilities assumed have been excluded from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  subsequent to acquisition  cash flows related to these acquired assets and assumed liabilities are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
for example  accounts receivable and accounts payable acquired or assumed as a part of the transaction are not reflected  respectively  as a use or source of cash 
however  the subsequent collection or payment  respectively  of accounts receivable and accounts payable acquired or assumed as a part of the transaction are reflected as an operating source or use of cash  respectively 
investing activities our most significant use of cash for investing activities was to expand our business through acquisitions 
total cash used in to acquire businesses  net of million cash acquired in the acquisitions  was approximately million 
during the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million to purchase property and equipment 
enhancements to our existing software and development of new software is essential to our continued growth and  during the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million to fund internal costs related to development of software for which technological feasibility has been established 
we believe the nature of nmatrix s operations will cause our property  equipment and software spending to increase during compared with we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated property  equipment and software spending in financing activities in conjunction with our acquisition of nmatrix  during november we amended our credit facility 
based on the terms of our amended credit facility  we increased our senior term loan borrowings from million to million 
the amended credit facility eliminated the requirement for quarterly amortizing payments on the senior term loan  but shortened the maturity of the senior term loan from june to august the amended credit facility also increased our senior revolving loan from million to million 
the maturity of the senior revolving loan was extended from june to november during the term of the loan  we have the right  subject to compliance with our covenants  to increase the senior revolving loan to million 
during november  under the amended credit facility we borrowed an additional million under the senior term loan and million under the senior revolving loan to finance the cash portion of our acquisition of nmatrix 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of million from the contingent convertible subordinated notes including the fair value of the embedded option  million under the credit facility s senior term loan  million under the credit facility s senior revolving loan  and approximately million of obligations related to capitalized leases and deferred acquisition price 
we believe that the funds generated from operations plus amounts available under our credit facility s senior revolving loan million at december  will be sufficient over the next year to finance currently anticipated working capital requirements  software expenditures  property and equipment expenditures  payments for contractual obligations  and interest payments due on our outstanding borrowings 
the million term loan under our credit facility matures in august in addition to current sources of liquidity discussed above  we may also consider an equity offering of our common shares to generate additional cash for payment of this term loan at maturity 
subject to compliance with certain covenants under the amended credit facility  we have the right to increase the senior revolving loan to million 
we believe that funds generated from operations combined with the flexibility to increase our borrowings under our credit facility provide the liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operational cash requirements 
we may pursue acquisitions in the future 
if the acquisition price exceeds our then available cash and unused borrowing capacity  we may decide to issue equity  restructure our credit facility  partly finance the acquisition with a note payable  or some combination of the preceding 
covenants contained in our credit facility may limit our ability to consummate an acquisition 
off balance sheet arrangements although we generally do not utilize off balance sheet arrangements in our operations  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
our operating lease obligations are disclosed below under contractual obligations and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments  excluding periodic interest payments  as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligation long term debt and future accretion employment agreements capital lease obligations operating leases total a portion of the bsi and hilsoft purchase price were paid in the form of a non interest bearing notes  which were discounted using an imputed rate of and  respectively  per annum 
the discounts are accreted over the life of the note and each period s accretion is added to the principal of the respective note 
the amount in the above contractual obligation table includes both the notes principal  as reflected on our december  consolidated balance sheet  and all future accretion 
if certain revenue objectives are satisfied  we will make additional payments  not to exceed million  over the next five years to the former owners of hilsoft 
such payments  if any  are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
convertible debt is included at stated value of the principal redemption and excludes adjustments related to the embedded option  which will not be paid in cash 
any conversion to our common stock of part or all of the convertible debt will reduce our cash obligation related to the convertible debt 
in conjunction with acquisitions  we have entered into employment agreements with certain key employees of the acquired companies 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for modifications to conversion options embedded in debt instruments and related issues 
eitf requires that  when a modification of a convertible debt instrument results in a change in the fair value of an embedded conversion option  the change in fair value of the embedded conversion option be included in the analysis of whether there has been a substantial change in the terms of the convertible debt instrument for purposes of determining whether the debt has been extinguishment 
eitf also requires subsequent recognition of interest expense for any change in the fair value of the embedded conversion option resulting from a modification of a convertible debt instrument 
eitf is effective beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective for epiq beginning january  accordingly  we will adopt sfas no

during february  our compensation committee approved acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested options for employees  including an executive officer  and non employee directors 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options and eliminate future compensation expense was based primarily on a review of our long term incentive programs considering the effect on our financial statements of changes in accounting rules that we must adopt in this action  which had an immaterial effect on our financial statements for the year ended december   will reduce the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on our future consolidated financial statements 
adoption of sfas no 
r will materially increase our recognized compensation expense and will have a material impact on our consolidated income statement and balance sheet 
we are working with independent valuation experts to document and validate key valuation variables  such as forfeiture rate  expected term  segmentation of employee population  expected term suboptimal exercise price  and expected volatility 
until this work is completed  we are unable to estimate the impact of adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
however  if subsequent to december  no new awards were issued and no existing awards were forfeited  we estimate that adoption of sfas no 
r would decrease our net income for the year ending december  by approximately million 
we do not anticipate that adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
our convertible debt and credit facility borrowings create market risks for us 
we do not actively manage these market risks
