item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights sales increased in fiscal over the prior year 
gross margins as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  or greater as a percentage of sales than the prior year 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal increased from the prior year  primarily due to incremental share based compensation expense  increased fuel costs and increased pension costs  partially offset by lower management performance based incentive compensation 
interest expense increased in fiscal over the prior year due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels 
the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal was due to the combination of the adoption of sfas r  coupled with the impact of certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal primarily as a result of these factors  net earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal decreased over the prior year 
the northeast redistribution center northeast rdc began operations in the third quarter of fiscal  therefore  the net impact of the national supply chain project in fiscal includes both expenses incurred by the project as well as certain direct benefits 
current direct benefits have been realized in the areas of cost of sales and operating expenses 
management estimates that expenses 
table of contents and direct benefits related to the national supply chain project had a net negative impact on earnings before income taxes of approximately  during fiscal in fiscal  sysco adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated 
the results of operations for fiscal include incremental share based compensation cost over what would have been recorded had the company continued to account for share based compensation under apb of   net of tax 
sysco adopted accounting pronouncement eitf accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  eitf at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal the accounting standard requires certain transactions  where inventory is purchased by sysco from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer as defined  to be presented in the income statement on a net basis 
the impact of adopting this new standard resulted in sales being reduced by  cost of sales were also reduced by the same amount and thus net earnings are unaffected by the adoption of this standard 
sysco adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and will apply it to similar transactions prospectively 
prior year s sales and cost of sales have not been restated 
therefore  the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins  operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the two years are affected 
in the first quarter of fiscal  sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting  due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans to assist the company in meeting accelerated sec filing dates  which increased net earnings for fiscal by  net of tax 
general economic conditions  including fuel costs and their impact on consumer spending  can have an impact on sysco s sales growth 
management believes that sysco s continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers  increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the company s marketing associates overcame these economic conditions and contributed to the company s sales growth in fiscal these economic conditions may continue to be a factor to sysco s sales growth in future periods 
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
sysco s operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies  specialty produce companies  custom cut meat operations  hotel supply operations  and sygma  the company s chain restaurant distribution subsidiary 
the company estimates that it serves about of an approximately billion annual market that includes the north american foodservice and hotel amenity  furniture and textile markets 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food prepared away from home  market represents approximately one half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level 
this share grew from about in to about in and has not changed materially since that time 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and in turn can impact sysco s sales 
sysco historically has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and has grown its market share in this fragmented industry 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include sales growth the company plans to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products purchased by existing customers  development of new customers  the use of foldouts new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other sysco operating companies and a disciplined acquisition program 
the company uses market information to estimate the potential sales and profitability of new and existing customers 
marketing resources  sysco brand products and value added services provided by sysco can be custom tailored to the purchasing needs of customers 
additionally  the investment of resources in any particular account can be made in proportion to the account s potential profitability 
brand management sysco brand products are manufactured by suppliers to meet the company s product specifications using strict quality assurance standards 
management believes that sysco brand products provide a greater value to customers and differentiate the company from its competitors 
management also believes that sysco brand products generally provide higher profitability than national brand products 

table of contents productivity gains the company s investment in warehousing and transportation technology and the implementation of best business practices allows sysco to leverage operating expenses relative to sales growth 
sales force effectiveness the company invests in the development and expansion of its customer contact resources by hiring additional customer contact personnel through targeted recruiting  hiring and promotion practices  effective use of training programs and improved compensation systems 
expanded business review and business development functions allow the sales force to strengthen customer relationships and increase sales 
supply chain management the company s national supply chain project and related organization is being developed to reduce total supply chain costs  operating costs and working capital requirements of the company 
national supply chain project the company s national supply chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for products for sysco s operating companies in each respective region and is expected to result in increased sales and profitability 
in addition  it will lower inventory  operating costs  working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at sysco s operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 
the company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers in the united states 
the first of these centers  the northeast rdc located in front royal  virginia  opened during the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal management identified a number of operational changes that they believed would make the northeast rdc more efficient and held case volumes constant while these changes were being implemented 
additional case volume began to flow through the northeast rdc after implementing these changes and case volumes continued to increase at a controlled and measured pace 
management continues to believe that the long term economic objectives of the project will be achieved 
the long term benefits expected to be realized from the national supply chain project will be reflected in the sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and interest expense line items in the results of operations statement 
in january  sysco completed the purchase of land in alachua  florida for the future site of its second rdc  which will service the company s five broadline operating companies in florida 
this facility is expected to be operational in fiscal the company has also purchased the site for construction of a third rdc in hamlet  indiana

in order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth  management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal by the estimated impact of the additional week 
as a result  sales for fiscal presented in the table below are adjusted by one fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter 
set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented weeks weeks weeks sales for the fiscal year estimated sales for the additional week adjusted sales actual percentage increase adjusted percentage increase sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers  however  the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify 
estimated product cost increases were during fiscal as compared to during fiscal 
table of contents sysco s continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers  increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the company s marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal the number of customer contact personnel has increased approximately since the end of fiscal management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general economic conditions  including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending  contributed to the softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of sysco s sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing into the first half of fiscal after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal  sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth in the latter half of fiscal and all of fiscal additionally  management believes that the continued focus on the company s business review process has contributed to unit sales growth 
industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below fresh and frozen meats canned and dry products frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other poultry dairy products fresh produce paper and disposables seafood beverage products equipment and smallwares janitorial products medical supplies a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other gross margins gross margins as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the adoption of eitf contributed to the increase in gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal management believes that the remaining gross margin increase was aided by several factors  including low product cost inflation and effective merchandising 
estimated product cost increases  an internal measure of inflation  were during fiscal  as compared to during fiscal sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers  however  during periods of rapidly increasing product costs  price increases to customers generally lag 
this lag impacted gross margins in fiscal as discussed below 
conversely  in fiscal  the moderation of product cost increases allowed sysco to be more effective in managing pricing to its customers 
this was achieved by maintaining stable pricing and avoiding the absorption of significant product cost increases before pricing to customers was adjusted 
the benefits realized by the national supply chain project and better leveraging of our purchasing power resulted in lower overall product costs 

table of contents gross margins as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal management believes that this gross margin decline was caused by several factors  including product cost increases  changes in segment mix  customer mix and pricing pressure 
the decline in gross margins as a percentage of sales slowed during the course of fiscal due in part to a lessening of the rate of product cost increases during the fiscal year 
product cost increases in most of the product categories had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales 
the gross margin reduction is generally due to two reasons i the resulting higher sales dollar base impacts the comparison of the ratio between the two years and ii price increases passed on to customers lag behind the product cost increases incurred from vendors 
in periods of rising product costs  even when gross margin dollars are maintained or slightly increased  the resulting gross margin percentage of sales ratio will be lower than the prior year due to the higher sales dollar base 
during periods of rapidly increasing product costs like those experienced in fiscal  price increases to customers generally lag 
in the case of marketing associate served customers  marketing associates will generally encounter resistance and may not be able to immediately raise prices 
in the case of multi unit customers  prices are agreed to contractually 
the contracted prices are fixed for periods of up to days and thus price increases to these customers will also lag 
the contracted prices are frequently also fee based which results in the same gross margin dollars with a higher sales price and therefore a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales 
changes in segment mix also contributed to the decline in gross margins in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
sales at the sygma segment  which traditionally have lower margins than broadline segment sales  grew faster than sales at the broadline segment 
changes in customer mix also contributed to the decline in gross margins in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
multi unit customer sales in the broadline segment  which traditionally yield lower gross margins and lower expenses than marketing associate served customer sales  grew faster  and thus represented a greater percentage of total sales in fiscal than in fiscal management also believes that competitive pricing pressures contributed to the decline in gross margins 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling  administrative and occupancy expenses 
changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors  including improved efficiencies  customer mix  and product cost increases which result in increases in sales prices 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales included incremental share based compensation  increased fuel costs  increased pension costs and increased expenses associated with the national supply chain project  partially offset by reduced management performance based incentive bonuses 
operating expenses for fiscal include incremental share based compensation cost of  resulting from the adoption of sfas r see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
fuel costs increased  fiscal over the prior year 
net pension costs increased  in fiscal over the prior year 
operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of  in fiscal to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value  as compared to a gain of  in fiscal management performance based incentive bonuses were reduced by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal management estimates that expenses and direct benefits related to the national supply chain project had a net negative impact on earnings before income taxes of approximately  during fiscal direct benefits from the national supply chain project in fiscal were primarily realized in reduced cost of sales 
the long term benefits expected to be realized from the national supply chain project will be reflected in the sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and interest expense line items in the results of operations statement 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was aided by improved operating efficiencies 
for example  the broadline segment continues to demonstrate improving trends in key expense metrics  including miles driven per trip  pieces per stop and pieces per error 
increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate than sales 
operating expenses for fiscal were negatively impacted by increased costs to deliver product to customers due to increased fuel costs of approximately  over the prior year 
operating expenses related to the national supply chain project were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a 
table of contents gain of  in fiscal to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value  as compared to a gain of  in fiscal operating expenses were reduced by a reduction of management performance based incentive bonuses of  and a decrease in net pension cost of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs  sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july  and july   respectively  were not material 
net pension costs for fiscal are expected to decrease  from fiscal due primarily to an increase in the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs 
interest expense the increase in interest expense of  in fiscal over fiscal was due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels 
in fiscal  commercial paper and short term bank borrowing rates increased over the prior year 
effective borrowing rates on long term debt also increased over the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal  effective borrowing rates on long term debt were lowered through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
higher overall borrowing levels are a result of the level of share repurchases  increased working capital requirements driven primarily by sales growth and continued capital investments in the form of additions to plant and equipment and acquisitions of new businesses 
the increase in interest expense of  in fiscal over fiscal  was due to increased borrowing interest rates 
the increase in the company s overall borrowing interest rates was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of the company s debt with fixed interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  the company s debt portfolio included a larger percentage of floating rate debt in the form of either commercial paper issuances or fixed rate debt converted to floating through interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  market interest rates increased during fiscal other  net changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal was a combination of the adoption of sfas r  which is discussed in note  share based compensation  and note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in item  and certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal sysco recorded a tax benefit of  or of the  in incremental share based compensation expense recorded in fiscal  as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
the income tax expense in fiscal was reduced by tax benefits totaling  primarily related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual and to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
net earnings net earnings decreased in fiscal over the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to the factors discussed above 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefits  which increased net earnings for fiscal by  net of tax 
the increases in net earnings in fiscal over fiscal were due to the factors discussed above 
in addition  the comparison of fiscal s net earnings to fiscal was negatively impacted by the additional rd week in fiscal 
table of contents earnings per share basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased and  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year 
these decreases were due primarily to the result of factors discussed above  partially offset by a net reduction in shares outstanding 
the net reduction in average shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share is primarily due to share repurchases 
the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to share repurchases  the exclusion of certain options from the diluted share calculation due to their anti dilutive effect and a modification of the treasury stock method calculation utilized to compute the dilutive effect of stock options as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
this modification results in lower diluted shares outstanding than would have been calculated had compensation cost not been recorded for stock options and stock issuances under the employees stock purchase plan 
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased and  respectively  in fiscal over prior year 
the increases in earnings per share were the result of factors discussed above  as well as a net reduction of shares outstanding due primarily to share repurchases 
return on average shareholders equity the return on average shareholders equity was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the lower return in fiscal was impacted by the reduction in earnings resulting from the adoption of sfas r as discussed above 
the higher return in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of minimum pension liability adjustments to shareholders equity 
since its inception  sysco has averaged approximately return on average shareholders equity 
segment results the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of the company s reportable segments expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements in item earnings earnings sales before taxes sales before taxes broadline sygma other the following table sets forth sales and earnings before taxes of each of the company s reportable segments expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements in item earnings earnings earnings sales before taxes sales before taxes sales before taxes broadline sygma other intersegment sales unallocated corporate expenses total the company does not allocate share based compensation related to stock option grants  issuances of stock pursuant to the employees stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants to non employee directors and corporate officers 
the increase in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to these items

table of contents broadline segment sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal the adoption of eitf in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced sales growth in fiscal by  or  sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for both fiscal and fiscal management believes that sysco s continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers  increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the company s marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal the fiscal sales growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers  including increased sales of sysco brand products and increases in both sales prices and unit volumes 
the comparison of fiscal sales to fiscal is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to strong sales growth in the sygma and other segments outpacing the broadline sales growth  as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat  specialty produce and sygma operations during fiscal and fiscal marketing associate served sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us remained the same at in fiscal and sysco brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us decreased to for fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal were primarily due to increases in sales partially offset by higher fuel costs and the continued investment in the national supply chain project 
the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal was primarily due to increases in sales and increased operating efficiencies aided by lower expenses as a percentage of sales 
factors contributing to the lower expenses as a percentage of sales were reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net periodic pension costs  which overcame higher fuel costs and increased expenditures related to the national supply chain project 
the comparison of fiscal s earnings before income taxes to fiscal was also negatively impacted by the additional rd week in fiscal sygma segment sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal the adoption of eitf in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced sales growth in fiscal by  or  sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal and for fiscal fiscal growth was due primarily to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers  each of which temporarily increases sygma s cost to service the customers 
in addition  certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations  contributing to the sales increase 
fiscal sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers  sales growth in sygma s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers  as well as increases in sales to existing locations  price increases resulting primarily from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions 
the comparison of fiscal sales to fiscal is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal was due to several factors 
certain of sygma s customers have experienced a slowdown in their business 
this in turn results in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop 
in addition  sygma has experienced increased fuel costs  startup costs related to new facilities  costs incurred on information systems projects and increased workers compensation costs 
the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal was due to several factors 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  sygma discontinued servicing a portion of its largest customer s locations due to that customer s geographic supply chain realignment 
sygma offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers 
in many cases  this new business is being served out of different sygma locations than those that originally served the discontinued business 
sygma opened a new facility to serve a portion of the new business which it began serving in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal  sygma s operating profits have been impacted by increased operating expenses as it transitioned its operations to serve the new business it has acquired 
in addition  sygma s gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal have declined from the comparable period in fiscal due to product cost increases and lower agreed upon pricing with its customers 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth  foldouts and acquisitions 
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its customer contact personnel and its consolidated buying programs  as well as the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
sysco s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
sysco s operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions compatible with the company s overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations may  at the discretion of management  be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt 
sysco s share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans  for acquisitions  to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization 
management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between and 
the ratio may exceed the target range from time to time  due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities  and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
this ratio was and at july  and july   respectively 
for purposes of calculating this ratio  long term debt includes both the current maturities and long term portion 
operating activities cash flow from operations in fiscal was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of  and an increase in accounts receivable balances of  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of  cash flow from operations in fiscal was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of  and an increase in accounts receivable balances of  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of  cash flow from operations in fiscal was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of  and an increase in accounts receivable balances of  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of  the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily a result of sales growth 
accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors  including changes in product mix  cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors due to the use of more efficient electronic payment methods 
also impacting cash flow from operations was an increase in accrued expenses of  in fiscal  a decrease in accrued expenses of  in fiscal and an increase in accrued expenses of  in fiscal the increase in accrued expenses for fiscal  was related to various miscellaneous accruals while the changes in accrued expenses for fiscal and were primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to those years 
also impacting cash flow from operations was an increase in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost of  in fiscal  and decreases of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost in fiscal are primarily due to the amount of net pension cost recognized exceeding the amount of pension contribution during the year 
the decreases in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost in fiscal and fiscal are primarily due to the amount of pension contributions exceeding the net pension cost recognized in each year 
the company s contributions to its defined benefit plans were   and  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
included in the amounts contributed in fiscal was  voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan representing the maximum tax deductible amount 
included in the amount contributed for fiscal was  voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter in addition to the  which was contributed during the year 
the decision to increase the contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure the year end obligation  which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal year end pension funded status prior to the additional  contribution 
the company expects to contribute approximately  to its defined benefit plans in fiscal 
table of contents one of the factors increasing the amount of taxes paid in fiscal as compared to the amounts paid in fiscal was the amount of deductible pension contributions made during the year 
as discussed above  the company s pension contributions were substantially lower in fiscal than in the preceding fiscal years 
the amount of taxes paid in fiscal was reduced by  as the result of the utilization of a us federal net operating loss carryforward 
this net operating loss carryforward was generated in fiscal primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain distributions

amounts included as deferred income tax liabilities related to bscc deferred supply chain distributions were  as of july  if sysco was required to accelerate a significant portion of these deferred tax liabilities  the company may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or it may be required to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination thereof and may be required to pay interest on amounts deferred 

table of contents in summary  management believes that the company s cash flows from operations  as well as the availability of additional capital under its existing commercial paper programs  bank lines of credit  debt shelf registration and its ability to access capital from financial markets in the future  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  sysco has entered into off balance sheet arrangements  such as letters of credit  which totaled  as of july  additionally  other than normal long term non capitalized leases included in the contractual obligations table below  the company does not have any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
none of these off balance sheet arrangements either has  or is likely to have  a material effect on sysco s current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information concerning sysco s obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations short term debt and commercial paper long term debt capital lease obligations deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to debt long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal  based on actuarial assumptions 
includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of july   assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity  and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july  included  in cash 
this amount is not included in the table above 
no obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of july   sysco does not have a minimum funding requirements under erisa guidelines for this plan due to its previous voluntary contributions 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure 
sysco s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  accounting for business combinations and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
in addition  allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
the company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including bankruptcy  accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods 
if the financial condition of sysco s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program sysco maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  group medical  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years and prior 
beginning in fiscal  the measurement date is may st which represents a change in accounting 
the one month acceleration of the measurement date allows additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial pension measurements in the year end financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated filing deadlines of the securities and exchange commission 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting resulted in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal of  net of tax 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal decreased to from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal of 
this decrease in the discount rate increased sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs  which was determined as of the may  measurement date  increased to 
this increase will decrease sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by an estimated  
table of contents sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
sysco used a plan specific age related set of rates for the qualified pension plan retirement plan  which are equivalent to a single rate of and  respectively  as of july  and july  the supplemental executive retirement plan assumes annual salary increases of through fiscal and thereafter as of july  and july  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately   and over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
a increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net pension costs for fiscal by approximately  minimum pension liability adjustments result when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets and are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at a minimum equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an offsetting charge or benefit to shareholders equity  net of tax  through accumulated other comprehensive loss or income 
amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to minimum pension liability  were charges  net of tax  of  as of july   and  as of july  changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plan  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions  increased net pension costs  in fiscal and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal by approximately the company made cash contributions to its pension plans of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  the company s voluntary contribution to the retirement plan represented the maximum tax deductible amount 
in fiscal  the company made a voluntary contribution of  in the fourth quarter in addition to the  which was contributed during the year 
the decision to increase the contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure the year end obligation  which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal year end pension funded status prior to the additional  contribution 
in fiscal  as in the previous years  contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions of approximately  which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other post retirement plans together are approximately  income taxes the determination of the company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
the company s provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances  and the company s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions  the company establishes an accrual when  despite management s belief that the company s tax return positions are supportable  management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable 
when facts and circumstances change  these accruals are adjusted 

table of contents vendor consideration sysco recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  sysco will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  sysco will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
in certain of these latter instances  the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco 
in these cases  sysco classifies the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 
accounting for business combinations goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  sysco assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values 
the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
share based compensation sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plans and the non employee directors stock plan 
prior to july   sysco accounted for its stock option plans and the employees stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas under which no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants and issuances of stock pursuant to the employees stock purchase plan 
however  share based compensation expense was recognized in periods prior to fiscal and continues to be recognized for stock issuances pursuant to the management incentive plans and stock grants to non employee directors 
share based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to fiscal effective july   sysco adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted through july   but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas r on july   sysco s earnings before income taxes and net earnings for fiscal were  and  lower  respectively  than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fiscal were both lower than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb as of july   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
sysco utilizes historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate 
table of contents groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans is based on the stock price less a discount for post vesting restrictions 
the discount for post vesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plans is accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
certain of sysco s option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
in those cases  sysco will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in other cases  certain of sysco s option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate 
in these cases  if it is probable that the performance condition will be met  sysco recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period  otherwise  it recognizes compensation cost over the probable longer service period 
in addition  certain of sysco s options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds  the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee 
in these cases  for awards granted prior to july   sysco will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires 
for awards granted subsequent to july   sysco will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
ftb  accounting for life settlement contracts by third party investors fsp ftb  in march which allows an investor to account for its investments in a life settlement contract using either the investment method or the fair value method 
the investment method requires the initial investment to be recognized at the transaction price  while the fair value method requires the initial investment to be recognized at its transaction price and remeasured to fair value each subsequent reporting period 
this standard was adopted by the fasb to address volatility concerns when underlying investments are maintained in the stock market 
the election of the investment method or fair value method is irrevocable and should be made on an instrument by instrument basis 
previously  only the fair value method was available 
fsp ftb is effective for sysco in the first quarter of fiscal prospective application is required for all new investments in life settlement contracts  and a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings should be made at the date of adoption to recognize the impact on existing life settlement contract investments 
sysco will adopt fsp ftb in the first quarter of fiscal using the investment method which will result in a cumulative change in accounting principle charge of approximately in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb statement no 
sfas 
fin clarifies the application of sfas by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  along with accounting for the related interest and penalties 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
sysco is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of fin will have on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  long term debt to capitalization target ratios  anticipated capital expenditures  timing and expected benefits of the national supply chain project and related regional distribution centers  the potential outcome of ongoing tax audits and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above 
in addition  sysco s ability to increase its market share and sales  meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
the ability to meet long term debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
sysco s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
in september  sysco issued senior notes totaling  due on september  in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes  sysco settled a  notional amount forward starting interest rate swap which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
at july   the company had outstanding  of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through july  the company s total long term debt obligations of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest 
the company had no interest rate swaps outstanding at july  in the following table as of july   commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the us and canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as long term based on the maturity date of the company s revolving loan agreement which supports the company s us and canadian commercial paper programs and the company s intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis

table of contents at july   the company had  of commercial paper outstanding at variable rates of interest with maturities through july  the company s total long term debt obligations of  were primarily at fixed rates of interest 
at that time  management believed that present market conditions reflected fixed long term rates near historical lows 
as such  management believed that fixed long term rates presented a better opportunity than in the recent past and had the intent to issue between  and  of long term debt at fixed rates with extended terms in september  the amount to be issued depending upon market conditions at the time of issuance 
in march  sysco entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of  as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on  of the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
the issuance of this long term debt in fiscal is discussed above 
during part of fiscal  sysco had several fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding 
these were entered into in fiscal as management believed that floating interest rates were more advantageous 
during fiscal  sysco terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding locking in effective yields on the related debt 
in the following tables as of july   commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and the us commercial paper is classified as long term based on the maturity date of the company s revolving loan agreement which supports the company s us commercial paper program and the company s intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis

to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in canadian dollars  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
sysco will also incur gains and losses within shareholders equity due to translation of the financial statements from canadian dollars to us dollars 
the canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in us dollars  which has the potential to create taxable income in canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date 
a unfavorable change in the fiscal year end exchange rate would not materially increase the tax liability associated with these notes 
the company does not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 

table of contents the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the company s results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price paid by sysco for product purchases for which sysco may not be able to pass these costs fully to its customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs incurred by sysco to deliver product to its customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs incurred by sysco in fiscal increased by approximately  over fiscal in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs  sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july  were not material
