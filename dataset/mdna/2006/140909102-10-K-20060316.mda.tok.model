item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a major manufacturer of recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products 
we operate in four business segments 
the paperboard segment manufactures recycled uncoated and clay coated paperboard 
the recovered fiber segment collects and sells recycled paper and brokers recycled paper and other paper rolls 
the tube  core and composite container segment produces spiral and convolute wound tubes  cores and cans 
the folding carton and custom packaging segment produces printed and unprinted folding carton and set up boxes and provides contract manufacturing and packaging services 
our business is vertically integrated to a large extent 
this means that our converting operations consume a large portion of our own paperboard production  approximately in the remaining of our paperboard production is sold to external customers in any of the four recycled paperboard end use markets tube  core and composite containers  folding cartons  gypsum wallboard facing paper and specialty paperboard products 
these integration statistics do not include volume produced or converted by our owned  unconsolidated joint ventures premier boxboard limited and standard gypsum  lp 
as part of our strategy to optimize our operating efficiency  each of our mills can produce recycled paperboard for more than one end use market 
this allows us to shift production among mills in response to customer or market demands 
more recently  in light of the difficult operating climate we have faced  and in an effort to reduce costs and improve our business mix  capacity deployment and profitability  restructuring activities have become an important element of our strategy 
our recent sale of our interest in standard gypsum  along with our recently announced intention to exit the coated recycled paperboard  specialty contract packaging and partition businesses  are part of our strategic transformation plan to reduce our debt and better position us to compete and leverage our expertise in our core businesses 
historically  we have grown our business  revenues and production capacity to a significant degree through acquisitions 
based on the difficult operating climate for our industry and our financial position over the last several years  the pace of our acquisition activity  and correspondingly  our revenue growth  has slowed as we have focused on conserving cash and maximizing the productivity of our existing facilities 
we are a holding company that operates our business through subsidiaries as of the date of this filing 
we also own a interest in one joint venture with temple inland  inc and owned another one during that we sold subsequent to year end 
we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
see liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings below 
key business indicator and trends our industry has historically been closely correlated with the domestic economy in general  and with consumer nondurable consumption packaging segment and industrial production tube  core and composite containers segment  specifically 
these demand drivers tend to be cyclical in nature  with cycles lasting years depending on such factors as gross domestic product  interest rates and other factors 
as these demand drivers fluctuate  we typically experience variability in volume  revenue and profitability in our business 
from late through  the recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products industry was in a down cycle 
since our industry has improved but has not returned to historical levels of demand and capacity utilization 
while we believe that future operating results may improve  we cannot ascertain when or to what extent this may occur 
the key operating indicator of our business is paperboard mill operating rates 
mill operating rates are calculated as the ratio of production compared with capacity  assuming a normalized mill schedule of days per year 
as paperboard mill operating rates increase  cost per ton of paperboard generally decreases 
as these 
table of contents tons are sold  profitability increases since fixed production costs are absorbed by more tons produced 
additionally  higher operating rates generally provide enhanced opportunity to recover material and labor increases through improved pricing 
this positively affects paperboard and converted products income from operations and cash flow 
paperboard mill operating rates are affected by demand and by mill closures 
industry demand decreased from due primarily to a recessionary general economy  the continued migration of us manufacturing offshore to lower labor cost environments and product substitution such as the replacement of paperboard carton packaging with plastic standup pouches 
the decrease in demand resulted in a decrease in operating rates for us and the industry as a whole 
we expect the migration of us manufacturing offshore and product substitution to continue  although at a slower rate  which could continue to negatively affect operating results 
we further expect these trends to be somewhat offset by the improving domestic economy  increased market share and our own paperboard mill capacity reductions 
recent industry improvement in operating rates has been driven by paperboard mill closures  as over million tons of capacity  or approximately of the recycled paperboard mill total capacity  was closed from through we have closed approximately thousand tons of our own paperboard mill capacity during this period to better match our supply capabilities to demand 
logo industry source american forest and paper association 
the decline in was primarily driven by downtime associated with an equipment upgrade at our sweetwater paperboard mill 
also note that these rates exclude our owned joint venture  premier boxboard  which we operate 
restructuring has been a primary component of management s strategy to address the decrease in demand resulting from secular trends  as discussed above  and generally weak domestic economic conditions 
between and  restructuring and asset impairment charges have totaled million  of which approximately million have been noncash charges  see results of operations and results of operations we have also experienced increases in near term manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs as a result of our transitioning of business within our mill and converting systems to other company facilities 
our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our competitiveness through reduced costs  increase revenue through delivery of differentiated quality products and services to our customers  and promote 
table of contents compliance with recent changes in legal and regulatory requirements 
our restructuring efforts have been directed toward reducing costs through manufacturing and converting facilities rationalization where we believed it was advantageous to do so due to geographic overlap  duplicative capabilities  changes in customer base and other factors 
rationalization of facilities typically results in increased cash outlays and expenses initially  for example  severance costs 
restructuring charges increased in versus but we believe that future earnings and cash flows will be favorably impacted by our continued efforts to reconfigure our business to increase efficiency and better match supply with customer demand 
recovered fiber  which is derived from recycled paper stock  is our most significant raw material 
historically  the cost of recovered fiber has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
for example  our average recovered fiber cost per ton of paperboard produced increased from per ton in to per ton in  an increase of  before dropping to per ton in recovered fiber cost per ton averaged during and excluding raw materials and labor  energy is our most significant manufacturing cost 
energy consists of fuel used to generate steam used in the paper making process and electrical purchases to operate our paperboard machines and all of our converting machinery 
in  the average energy cost in our mill system was approximately per ton compared to per ton in  a decrease 
in energy costs averaged per ton  an increase of from until the last few years  our business had not been significantly affected by energy cost increases  and we historically have not passed increases in energy costs through to our customers 
consequently  as the volatility of energy prices has increased dramatically over the last three years  we have not been able to pass through to our customers all of the energy cost increases we have incurred 
as a result  our operating margins have been adversely affected 
although we continue to evaluate our energy costs and consider ways to factor energy costs into our pricing  we cannot give assurance that our operating margins and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
see part i  item  risk factors our operating margins may be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
we raise our selling prices in response to increases in raw material and energy costs 
however  we often are unable to pass the full amount of these costs through to our customers on a timely basis due to supply and demand in the industry  and as a result often cannot maintain our operating margins in the face of dramatic cost increases 
we experience margin shrinkage during all periods of cost increases due to customary time lags in implementing our price increases 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to recover any future increases in the cost of recovered fiber by raising the prices of our products 
even if we are able to recover future cost increases  our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases 
see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be harmed by future increases in raw material and other operating costs 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves forming estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
changes in these estimates are recorded periodically based on updated information 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue and the related account receivable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of 
table of contents criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
generally  we recognize revenue when we ship our manufactured products or when we complete a service and title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
provisions for discounts  returns  allowances  customer rebates and other adjustments which have averaged less than of sales for the years ended december   and are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are determined based on historical experience or specific customer arrangements 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
when we become aware of a customer whose financial viability is questionable  we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments 
if a customer enters a bankruptcy action  we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for noncollectibility is warranted 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and our provision for uncollectible accounts was thousand  million and million for the years ending  and  respectively 
the decline in our provision during primarily resulted from recoveries of previously reserved accounts 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes raw materials  direct and indirect labor  employee benefits  energy and fuel  depreciation  chemicals and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management reviews inventory at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write offs for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
inventory over six months old is generally deemed unsaleable at first quality prices unless customer arrangements or other special circumstances exist 
we reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on management s judgment of future realization 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the write offs required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory  however  in  and  these write offs  other than those related to specific customer bankruptcies  were insignificant 
goodwill 
we test the carrying amount of goodwill at least annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes  growth rates of selling prices and costs  changes in working capital  investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we also test the sensitivities of fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes  selling prices and costs 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible impairment is indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit attributed to those net assets 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 
we also use judgment in assessing whether we should test more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition  product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
our most recent annual impairment test was performed november  and did not result in an impairment 
however  recognizing certain impairment indicators related to the decision to exit 
table of contents the coated recycled paperboard business  we retested goodwill as of december  and recorded a million impairment 
an additional million of goodwill was impaired which was in our paperboard segment and was a result of our decision to exit the coated recycled paperboard business 
see additional discussion regarding our discontinued operations in the notes to our financial statements in part ii  item we believe that our remaining goodwill balance of million is not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in conditions may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could initiate an impairment review include the following significant operating losses recurring operating losses significant declines in demand for a product produced by an asset capable of producing only that product assets that are idled or held for sale assets that are likely to be divested the impairment review requires management to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets and sum the estimated future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  then we must estimate the fair value of the asset 
if the fair value of the asset is below the carrying value  then the difference will be written off 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and results of operations 
impairment charges related to property plant and equipment of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
of the million of impairment charges recorded in  million was recorded in the results of discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of the charges represent the difference between the carrying value of the assets and estimated fair value 
the impairment was primarily the result of our decision to exit the coated recycled paperboard and specialty contract packaging business 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health care costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
our self insured workers compensation liability is estimated based on actual claims as established by a third party administrator  increased by factors that reflect our historical claim development 
the developed claim  net of amounts paid and discounted to present value  represents the liability that we record in our financial statements 
the primary controllable driver of our workers compensation liability is the loss development factor that estimates the amount to which one dollar in actual claims incurred will ultimately grow over the life of the claim  which may be several years 
a increase in the loss development factors utilized for would have resulted in a thousand increase in workers compensation expense and accrued liability at december  our self insured health care liability is estimated based on our actual claim experience and multiplied by a time lag factor of days 
the lag factor represents an estimate based on historical experience of claims that have been incurred and should be recorded as a liability  but have not been reported 
a increase in the lag factor would have resulted in a thousand increase in our healthcare costs and accrued liability at december  future actual costs related to self insured coverages will depend on claims incurred  medical cost trends  which have increased in recent years  safety performance and various other factors related to our employee population  which has decreased in recent years 
while we believe that our 
table of contents assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and state tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our statement of operations and our balance sheet 
at december  and  we had net federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating losses of and million  respectively 
at december  and the company established valuation allowances of and million for a portion of these deferred tax assets  respectively 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
the pension plan provides benefits to be paid to all eligible employees at retirement based primarily on years of service with the company and compensation rates in effect near retirement 
our policy is to fund benefits attributed to employees services to date as well as service expected to be earned in the future 
during september  the company contributed million to the pension plan relating to the plan year and there were no contributions made in relating to the plan year 
based on our current estimate of future funding requirements  we do not expect that we will be required to make a contribution during the year ended december  in september  the company announced the suspension of any further pension benefits for certain employees covered by the pension plan 
the suspension was effective as of december  and froze the accrued pension benefits for employees not subject to a collective bargaining agreement and employees who do not qualify for continued benefits based on years of service and age requirements 
the curtailment reduced the company s december  projected benefit obligation by million and increased pension expense by thousand 
certain executives participate in a supplemental executive retirement plan serp  which provides retirement benefits to participants based on average compensation 
the serp was unfunded at december  the determination of our pension plan and serp benefit obligations and expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the weighted average discount rate  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets and the weighted average rate of compensation increase 
the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions we used to determine our pension plan s projected benefit obligation as of december  weighted average discount rate weighted average rate of compensation increase 
table of contents the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions to determine net periodic pension expense for the years ended december  weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets weighted average rate of compensation increase in developing the weighted average discount rate  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including estimated timing of obligation payments and yields for long term bonds that received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate  determined on this basis  was at december  and december  based on analysis of the rating and maturity of the long term bonds  the timing of payment obligations and the input from our actuaries  we concluded that a discount rate of is appropriate and reflects the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds that has the same duration as the plan obligations 
future actual pension expense and benefit obligations will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to populations participating in our pension plans 
a change in the discount rate would result in a change in the december  projected benefit obligation of approximately million and estimated net pension expense of approximately thousand 
in developing our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets  we evaluated such criteria as return expectations by asset class and long term inflation assumptions 
our expected weighted average rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity  fixed income and investment in a portfolio of hedge funds 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the expected weighted average rate of return of for december  should be lowered to for december  a change in the weighted average expected rate of return would change estimated net pension expense thousand 
although no contribution was required in  we contributed million in the third quarter of primarily as a result of a change in our mortality assumptions  the under funded status of our pension plan and the serp increased by approximately million in we believe the change in our mortality assumptions is more representative of the plan s participant demographics 
while we believe that the assumptions we have used are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension plan and serp liability 
we also provide postretirement medical benefits at certain of our subsidiaries 
our net periodic postretirement benefit cost for medical costs was approximately thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at december  and were determined using a weighted average discount rate of  respectively 
the rate of increase in the costs of covered health care benefits is assumed to be in  decreasing each year to by the year and decreasing to by the year increasing or decreasing the assumed health care costs trend rate by one percentage point would have increased or decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately thousand and  respectively and this would have increased or decreased net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately thousand and thousand  respectively  for the year ended december  depreciation 
management is required to make estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of long lived assets 
these estimates can significantly affect depreciation expense and accordingly  both results of operations and the asset values reflected on the balance sheet 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows paperboard shipment volume  selling price per ton  recovered fiber cost per ton for the paperboard mills  and paperboard cost per ton for the tube and core operations for the periods indicated 
the information below showing average selling price and average cost per ton  is presented because management believes they are the most significant indicators of profitability for the paperboard segment and the tube  core and composite container segment 
historically  recovered fiber has been our largest raw material cost component and has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
however  these drivers are not the only factors that can impact these segments 
see risk factors in part i  item for additional discussion of factors that impact our business 
also note that a portion of our sales do not have related paperboard volume  such as sales of contract packaging services and sales of recovered fiber

total paperboard tonnage  including discontinued operations  decreased in tons sold from paperboard mill production decreased in total tons sold to our converters  excluding discontinued operations  decreased in total paperboard tonnage decreased due to the following factors lower sales of unconverted paperboard shipped to our customers in the gypsum wall board facing paper end user market is due to an equipment upgrade at our sweetwater mill which temporarily decreased production 
in addition  certain volume was transferred to our owned  unconsolidated  premier boxboard mill 
a decrease in internal conversion by our tube  core and composite container segment  carton and custom packaging segment and other specialty converting operations 
this decrease was driven primarily by lower industry demand

table of contents paperboard segment sales for the paperboard segment decreased due to the following factors lower sales of approximately million due to the june divestiture of our chemical sales operation combined with the closure of our puzzle operations 
lower volume accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
these factors were partially offset by higher selling prices for unconverted paperboard which accounted for an estimated million increase in sales 
recovered fiber segment sales for the recovered fiber segment increased primarily due to higher volume which accounted for approximately million of the increase partially offset by lower selling prices which accounted for a million decrease in sales 
tube  core and composite container segment sales for the tube  core and composite container segment increased due to higher tube and core selling prices which accounted for approximately million of the increase 
this increase was partially offset by the following factors lower volume accounted for an approximate million decrease in sales 
lower volume for forming sales and other products accounted for an approximate million decrease in sales 
folding carton and custom packaging segment sales for the folding carton and custom packaging segment decreased due to a volume decrease of approximately million primarily as a result of ending a relationship with a significant customer with low margins and high credit risk 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for increased million from million in to million in this increase was due to the following factors higher freight costs of million 
higher other manufacturing costs of approximately million 
these cost increases were primarily driven by the increase in petroleum based products used in various manufacturing processes 
higher energy and fuel costs in the paperboard segment of approximately million 
higher pension and other employee costs of approximately million 
higher repair and maintenance costs in the paperboard segment of approximately million 
accelerated depreciation expense of approximately million related to the closure of the palmer carton plant 
these factors were partially offset by the following lower cost of sales of approximately million due to the divestiture of our chemical sales operation and the closure of our puzzle operations in lower cost of sales of approximately million driven by lower volume in our carton segment 
lower recovered fiber costs in the paperboard segment  driven by lower volume  accounted for an approximate million decrease in cost of sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of from the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was the result of the following higher pension and other employee costs of approximately million 
higher employee and administrative costs of approximately million related to two initiatives centralization of our accounting and finance operations and an investment in other back office functions in order to reduce professional fees  purchasing and other costs in the long term 
higher information technology costs of related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and higher costs associated with the implementation of enterprise resource planning software 
these factors were partially offset by the following lower professional and consultant fees related to internal control testing and compliance work associated with the sarbanes oxley act of and consolidated accounting costs incurred in of approximately million

goodwill impairment 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million goodwill impairment resulting from the loss of synergies that exist between the coated recycled paperboard business and the folding carton and custom packaging segment 
the folding carton and custom packaging segment will lose these synergies upon the disposal of the coated recycled paperboard business 
restructuring and other impairment costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded charges totaling million for restructuring and other impairment costs 
included in this total were thousand in severance and other termination benefit costs  million in other exit costs and a reversal of thousand in loss on disposals 
for the year ended december   we recorded charges totaling million for restructuring and impairment costs 
included in this total were million in severance and other termination benefit costs  million in other exit costs and million in asset impairment charges 
these restructuring plans are a component of management s strategy to match supply with market demand  lower costs and streamline production capabilities

total paperboard tonnage increased in tons sold from paperboard mill production increased in total tons sold to our converters increased in total paperboard tonnage increased due to the following factors an increase in sales of unconverted paperboard to external customers in the other specialty and tube  core and composite container end use markets 
an increase in internal conversion by our specialty paperboard converting operations  tube  core and composite container segment and the folding carton and custom packaging segment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of unconverted paperboard to external customers in the folding carton end use market  primarily driven by weak demand in our coated paperboard mill system  combined with the closing of one of two coated recycled paperboard machines at our rittman  ohio facility 
lower sales of unconverted paperboard shipped to our customers in the gypsum wallboard facing paper end use market 
this decrease was primarily due to the transfer of volume from our buffalo paperboard mill to our owned  unconsolidated  premier boxboard joint venture

net loss 
due to the factors discussed above  net loss for was million  or net loss per common share  compared to net loss of million  or net loss per common share  in liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources and risks 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility  described below 
downturns in operations can significantly affect our ability to generate cash 
factors that can affect our operating results and liquidity are discussed further in this annual report under risk factors in part i  item in  we generated million in cash from operations 
at december  we had million of cash on hand and million borrowing availability under our senior credit facility 
we believe that our cash on hand and borrowing availability under our existing  and expected replacement senior credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
additionally  based on our historical ability to generate cash  we believe we will be able to meet our long term cash requirements 
however  if we are unable to generate cash at historic levels  our ability to meet long term requirements is uncertain 
the following are factors that could affect our future ability to generate cash from operations a contraction in domestic demand for recycled paperboard and related packaging products similar to what our industry experienced in  and increased market acceptance of alternative products  such as flexible packaging and plastics  that have replaced or can replace certain of our packaging products 
continued export of domestic industrial manufacturing operations 
continued increase in fuel costs 
market acceptance of price increases and energy surcharges in response to rising operating costs  and significant unforeseen adverse conditions in our industry or the markets we serve 
the occurrence  continuation or exacerbation of these conditions could require us to seek additional funds from external sources in order to meet our liquidity requirements 
in such event  our ability to obtain additional funds would depend on the various business and credit market conditions prevailing at the time  which are difficult to predict and many of which are out of our control 
our ability to secure additional funds could also be materially adversely affected by our substantial indebtedness 
additional risks related to our substantial indebtedness are discussed in part i  item  risk factors our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness 
the availability of liquidity from our existing borrowings is primarily affected by our continued compliance with the terms of the agreement governing our senior credit facility  including the payment of interest and compliance with various covenants and financial maintenance tests 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility during absent a deterioration of the us economy as a whole or the specific sectors on which our business depends see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in industrial production  housing and construction and the consumption of nondurable and durable goods  we believe we will be in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement during the remainder of as noted below  however  
table of contents our senior credit facility matures in june  and we are negotiating to obtain a replacement credit facility 
if we are unable to obtain a replacement facility on terms acceptable to us  we may be required to seek funds from other sources in order to meet our liquidity requirements 
borrowings

net of original issuance discounts and accumulated discount amortization related to the senior and senior subordinated notes 
as described below under interest rate swap agreements  realized gains resulting from unwinding interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of debt and will be accreted as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 
our senior credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit of million and is secured primarily by a first priority security interest in our accounts receivable and inventory 
the facility matures in june borrowing availability is subject to borrowing base requirements established by eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the facility includes a subfacility of million for letters of credit  usage of which reduces availability under the facility 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility  however  an aggregate of million in letter of credit obligations were outstanding 
availability under the facility at december  was limited to million after taking into consideration outstanding letter of credit obligations 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either the base rate which is the prime rate most recently announced by bank of america  na  the administrative agent under the facility plus a margin of between and or the adjusted london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin of between and  with the applicable margin to be set based on our levels of available cash 
the undrawn portion of the facility is subject to a facility fee at an annual rate of 
outstanding letters of credit are subject to an annual fee equal to the applicable margin for libor based loans 
at december   the applicable interest margin for base rate borrowings was and the applicable interest margin for libor borrowings was the facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability and our subsidiaries ability to create liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  incur indebtedness and guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  make capital expenditures in excess of million per year or change the nature of our business 
the facility also contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  which applies only in the event borrowing availability falls below million or suppressed availability falls below million 
suppressed availability is defined as the amount of eligible accounts receivable and inventory less reserves and aggregate credit outstandings in excess of million or the amount of eligible inventory less reserves and aggregate credit outstandings in excess of million 
the fixed charge ratio covenant did not require measurement at december  
table of contents the facility contains events of default including  but not limited to  nonpayment of principal or interest  violation of covenants  breaches of representations and warranties  cross default to other indebtedness  bankruptcy and other insolvency events  material judgments  certain erisa events  actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation and certain changes of control of our company 
effective january   we amended our senior credit facility to permit  among other things  the sale of our interest in standard gypsum  lp to our joint venture partner  temple inland inc  which we completed on january  see subsequent events for more information about the sale of standard gypsum  lp as noted above  our senior credit facility matures in june we are currently negotiating to obtain a new senior credit facility  which we expect will consist of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our non real estate assets  including our accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
if we complete this new credit facility  we expect to utilize borrowings under the facility  together with proceeds from the sale of our interest in standard gypsum  proceeds from other asset sales and existing cash  to retire long term debt 
although we believe we will be able secure a new credit facility on the terms described above  we have not obtained a commitment for this facility  and can give no assurance that we will be able obtain a new facility on these terms or other terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain a replacement credit facility  our plans to retire long term debt and our ability to meet our long term liquidity requirements could be materially and adversely affected 
on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due june  our senior notes were issued at a discount to yield an effective interest rate of  are unsecured obligations of our company and pay interest semiannually 
after taking into account realized gains from unwinding various interest rate swap agreements  the current effective interest rate of the senior notes is 
see interest rate swap agreements below regarding transactions that lowered the effective interest rates of the senior notes 
in connection with the offering of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  as described below  our subsidiary guarantors also guaranteed our senior notes 
we have purchased an aggregate of million of these notes in the open market 
these purchases lowered our interest expense approximately thousand annually 
on march   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may  and million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due april  the senior notes and senior subordinated notes were issued at a discount to yield effective interest rates of and  respectively 
after taking into account realized gains from unwinding various interest rate swap agreements  the current effective interest rate of the senior subordinated notes is 
see interest rate swap agreements below regarding transactions that lowered the effective interest rates of the senior subordinated notes 
these publicly traded notes are unsecured  but are guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all but one of our domestic subsidiaries 
during and we purchased million and million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes in the open market  respectively 
these purchases lowered our interest expense approximately million annually 
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements 
see contractual obligations below and the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which detail these future obligations and commitments 
interest rate swap agreements 
historically  we have used interest rate swaps to effectively convert our fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate obligations 
this strategy has been employed in order to effect an optimal balance between fixed rate and variable rate obligations since  historically  variable rate debt obligations are lower cost than fixed rate debt 
during  and we entered into several interest rates swaps and then unwound those swaps opportunistically for a gain 
these gains provided cash to us upon unwinding and lowered our interest expense over the remaining duration of the related debt obligation 
as of december  we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements

off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings 
as noted above  as of december  we owned a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc standard gypsum  lp and premier boxboard limited llc 
because we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting  the indebtedness of these joint ventures is not reflected in the liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheets 
standard gypsum manufactures gypsum wallboard  and premier boxboard is a low cost recycled paperboard mill that produces a lightweight gypsum facing paper along with containerboard grades 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report for summarized financial information for these joint ventures 
on september  standard gypsum refinanced its outstanding letter of credit reimbursement obligations with borrowings under a new term loan in the principal amount of million from a replacement lender 
the term loan matures in full one year from the agreement date 
at december   we were severally obligated for of standard gypsum s obligations for principal  interest  fees and other amounts with respect to the term loan 
the other standard gypsum partner  temple inland  guaranteed of standard gypsum s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under the term loan totaled million  of which we were obligated for one half million 
our obligation with respect to the standard gypsum term loan was supported by a letter of credit in the face amount of million  issued in favor of the standard gypsum lender 
this letter of credit was issued under our senior credit facility and was scheduled to expire in october the letter of credit permitted the standard gypsum lender to draw in the event of a default under the standard gypsum loan agreement  including failure by standard gypsum to pay any principal  interest or other amounts owing under the term loan 
in connection with the term loan  we amended our senior credit facility effective september  to permit the issuance of this letter of credit 
as noted below  on january  we completed the sale of our interest in standard gypsum to our joint venture partner  temple inland inc  for million in cash and eliminated our guaranty and letter of credit support obligation with respect to standard gypsum s debt 
as a result of this sale  we no longer have any support obligation with respect to standard gypsum s debt 
at december   premier boxboard was the borrower under a credit facility with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of thousand  consisting solely of an undrawn letter of credit 
on january   premier boxboard s revolving credit facility expired 
the only outstanding obligation under the facility at the time of expiration was the thousand letter of credit balance  which expired on june  and was not renewed 
premier boxboard placed thousand of available cash into a trust account to replace the expired letter of credit 
funding for premier boxboard is generated by its internal cash flow and any cash contributions that we and our joint venture partner are permitted to make 
premier boxboard generated sufficient cash flow in to distribute million to us and million to our joint venture partner 
based on the cash flows and expected future cash flows  we do not expect premier boxboard to require external funding in the foreseeable future 
however  if premier boxboard were to require additional funding  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we and our joint venture partner were unable to adequately satisfy premier boxboard s funding requirements  its operations  and accordingly  our interest in it  could be adversely affected 
in addition  a substantial portion of the assets of premier boxboard are pledged as security for million in outstanding principal amount of senior notes under which premier boxboard is the obligor 
these notes are guaranteed by temple inland  but are not guaranteed by us 
in the event of a default under these notes  the holders would also have recourse to the assets of premier boxboard that are pledged to secure these notes 
thus  any resulting default under these notes could result in the assets of premier boxboard being utilized to satisfy creditor claims  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of premier boxboard and  accordingly  our interest in premier boxboard 
as of december   premier boxboard was in compliance with its debt covenants 

table of contents additional contingencies relating to our premier boxboard joint venture that could affect our liquidity include possible additional capital contributions and buy sell triggers which  under certain circumstances  give us and our joint venture partner either the right  or the obligation  to purchase the other s interest or to sell an interest to the other 
we are required  to the extent necessary  to make additional capital contributions to enable the joint venture to meet existing obligations 
under the premier boxboard joint venture agreement  in general  mutual buy sell rights are triggered upon the occurrence of involuntary transfers  and in the event of change of control  actual or imminent  of temple inland or its subsidiaries or in the event of a deadlock  as defined in the joint venture agreement 
the buy sell provisions are structured such that we are contemplated to be the purchaser in the event of any voluntary transfer of membership interest 
we generally consider our relationship with temple inland to be good with respect to our premier boxboard joint venture 
however  as described above  we could be required to fund premier boxboard s operations with additional cash contributions to the extent it is unable to fund operations with internally generated cash 
we cannot give assurance that material liquidity events will not arise with respect to our joint venture  and the occurrence of any such events could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payment obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the long term debt obligation included in this table represents the principal amount to be paid in future periods 
the amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheet include realized interest rate swap gains and the mark to market value of interest rate swaps 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the long term debt obligation and interest payment obligation schedule excludes debt and interest from the sprague bonds of million and million  respectively 
the debt is included in current liabilities of discontinued operations 
other long term liabilities excludes future pension liabilities  other postretirement benefit liabilities and deferred compensation benefit liabilities 
for the purposes of this table  purchase obligations included in the table above are agreements for purchase of goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on caraustar and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
however  this table does not include the aggregate amount of routine purchase orders outstanding as of december   because they are not enforceable and legally binding 
cash from operations 
cash generated from operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million in the decline in operating cash flow from to is primarily attributable to the following factors a million decrease in pension liabilities compared with a million increase in pension liabilities for resulted in a year over year decrease in operating cash flow of million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a million pension contribution in 
table of contents a million decrease in accrued liabilities compared with a million increase in accrued liabilities for resulted in a year over year decrease in operating cash flow of million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a million settlement of a lease obligation 
the above factors were partially offset by the following a million decrease in inventories compared with a million increase in inventories in resulted in a year over year increase in operating cash flow of million 
this increase was primarily the result of management initiatives to reduce inventory levels 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million in versus million in aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million are anticipated for acquisition 
in december  we acquired a folding carton plant in charlotte  north carolina from the sonoco products company for million 
we believe that this acquisition is in line with our long term strategy and will provide solid value to our folding carton and custom packaging segment in the charlotte area 
divestiture 
in december  we completed the sale of our maryland based hunt valley corrugated operations to green bay packaging  inc for million 
this facility was sold since it was our only corrugated manufacturing plant and had incurred significant losses 
we recorded a million loss on disposal which was recorded in the results of discontinued operations 
dividends 
in  we suspended dividend payments on our common stock until our earnings performance and cash flow performance improve 
as described under liquidity and capital resources  our debt agreements contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends and currently preclude us from doing so 
inflation raw material and energy cost changes have had  and continue to have  a material negative effect on our operations 
we do not believe that general economic inflation is a significant determinant of our raw material and energy cost increases or that it has a material effect on our operations 
subsequent event on february   we sold our partition business to rts  a joint venture between the rock tenn company and the sonoco products company  for approximately million 
this business was classified as a discontinued operation as of december  new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no

it states that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of overhead costs be based upon normal capacity for the production facilities and that any overhead costs not allocated due to lower production  be recognized as current period charges and not capitalized in inventory

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfaf no 
 statement of cash flows 
the approach in sfas no 
r is generally similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the earnings statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
we adopted sfas no 
r as of january  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas no 
 through december  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally have not recognized compensation costs for employee stock options 
we estimate that pretax compensation expense for stock options will be approximately thousand in sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
this change would not have impacted operating cash flows for the years ended december   and since we incurred tax losses and any such benefit would have been deferred 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligation fin an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the primary objective of fin is to clarify that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
refers to a legal obligation to perform as asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may of may not be within the control of the entity 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted this interpretation december  and it did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements or disclosures
