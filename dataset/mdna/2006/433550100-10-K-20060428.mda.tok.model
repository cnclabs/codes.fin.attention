company overview the company is a leading single source supplier of electronic computer controlled embroidery machinery and related value added products and services to the embroidery industry 
the company offers a complete line of technologically advanced single and multi head embroidery machines  proprietary application software and a diverse line of embroidery supplies and accessories 
hirsch believes its comprehensive customer service  user training  software support through pulse and broad product offerings combine to place the company in a competitive position within its marketplace

in july tajima granted to hirsch the non exclusive right to distribute to its existing us customers who have expanded their operations into the caribbean region 
as of january   the company sold its majority interest in tui to tajima 
the company grew rapidly from the time of its initial public offering through fiscal growth during this period was fueled by rapid technological advances in software and hardware  the strong demand for embroidered products  the creation of new embroidery applications and the strength of the embroidery entrepreneur as a growing segment of the marketplace 
the company believes that the purchasers of smaller embroidery machines are a significant source of repeat business for the sale of additional embroidery machines as the entrepreneurs operations expand 
the market is and has been affected by the fluctuating value in foreign exchange of the us dollar versus the yen resulting in dollar price pressure for machine sales 
most japanese based equipment competitors in the industry including the company faced difficulty in meeting these new market demands 
in fiscal the company initiated a restructuring program to address the market shifts in the industry  including closing and consolidating certain divisions  reducing total employment  and consolidating facilities that were no longer required to support its new business model

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of hirsch s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company distributes embroidery equipment that it offers for sale 
where installation and customer acceptance are a substantive part of the sale  by its terms  the company has deferred recognition of the revenue until such customer acceptance of installation has occurred 
in fiscal years  and  most sales of new equipment did not require installation as a substantive part of its sales and accordingly the company recorded its sales at the time the machinery was shipped 
service revenues and costs are recognized when services are provided 
sales of software are recognized when shipped provided that no significant vendor and post contract and support obligations remain and collection is probable 
sales of parts and supplies are recognized when shipped 
long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangibles and purchased technologies  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences resulting from temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results could be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the fifo weighted average cost for supplies and parts and specific cost for embroidery machines and peripherals 
the inventory balance is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income loss could be significantly adversely affected 
warranty the company provides a five year limited warranty for its embroidery machines 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims on a quarterly basis 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s operating expenses and net income loss could be significantly adversely affected

backlog and inventory the ability of the company to fill orders quickly is an important part of its customer service strategy

recent accounting pronouncements see note q to the consolidated financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the company may from time to time enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
the company did not enter into any forward contracts during fiscal any company debt  if utilized  is us dollar denominated and floating rate based 
at year end  there was no usage of the revolving credit facility that the company had maintained through february  with congress financial 
if the company had utilized its credit facility  it would have exposure to rising and falling rates  and an increase in such rates would have an adverse impact on net pre tax expenses 
the company does not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements
