item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal consolidated net sales were approximately billion  a decrease of million compared to the previous year 
the decrease is driven primarily by lower sales volumes in both segments 
engines segment net sales were billion versus billion in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in engine unit shipments between years 
the shipment decline is attributable to softer retail demand for lawn and garden equipment and efforts by retailers and oems to control inventory levels in the wake of reduced demand 
this unit shipment decline was partially offset by million from a price increase implemented in the beginning of the fiscal year  as well as a favorable mix of engine unit shipments 
power products net sales were billion in both fiscal and lower volumes in fiscal of million for pressure washer and lawn and garden equipment sales were almost fully offset by million of increased volume and pricing on generators as well as million from a favorable mix of lawn and garden product 
management believes the decline in volume of lawn and garden and pressure washer sales is attributable to lower consumer discretionary spending  which resulted in lower demand at retailers 
gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of the volume decreases noted above offset by pricing improvements in both segments 
engines segment margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in margin is attributable to the price increase discussed above as well as million in gains on the sale of operating assets 
in addition  ongoing cost reduction programs contributed million to the margin 
these positive margin enhancers were enough to overcome the impact of a production volume decline  a mix of product that favored lower margin units and other manufacturing cost increases 
the power products segment margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline is primarily attributable to million in losses associated with the wind down of operations at the murray  inc operating facility and the write off of excess inventory related to murray product 
partially offsetting these losses was million in pricing improvements  primarily on generators 
engineering  selling  general and administrative costs engineering  selling  general and administrative costs increased million between years 
excluding the impact of the million write off of the murray  inc trade receivable that occurred in fiscal the category increased million between years 
increases in this category in fiscal as compared to fiscal included million from the expensing of stock based compensation in fiscal  million in increased legal fees associated with litigation  million associated with increased information technology spending  and million from increased engineering costs associated with new product development in the power products segment 
planned increases of million in selling and advertising costs also contributed to the year over year increase in this category 
interest expense interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is attributable to higher borrowings between years associated with the term notes used for the murray  inc asset acquisition in february other income other income decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is attributed primarily to higher deferred financing expenses 
deferred financing expense increased as a result of the acceleration of debt repayments and the write off of associated deferred financing costs 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was approximately in both fiscal and fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal consolidated net sales were approximately billion  an increase of million  or compared to the previous year 
the increase is attributable almost entirely to growth within the power products segment 
engines segment net sales were billion versus billion in the prior year  an improvement of million or 
the improvement was the result of a engine unit shipment increase  which contributed million  and million from pricing and a favorable euro exchange rate 
the increase in engine unit shipments was driven by market share gains as well as million in increased shipments to our power products segment  that were eliminated in consolidation 
these favorable items were offset by a mix of product that favored lower priced units and million of lower service and component sales 
power products net sales were billion versus million in the prior year  a million increase 
the acquisition of simplicity and murray contributed and million respectively to the segment s growth 
in addition  increased generator demand sparked by unprecedented hurricane activity early in the year  as well as florida legislation that provided for a tax holiday on purchases of hurricane related supplies late in the fiscal year  resulted in increased segment sales of million 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million between years 
the acquisition of simplicity added million 
the sales of murray branded products and components added million 
these increases along with other volume and price improvements in both segments were offset by significant cost increases  which led to margin percentage decreases in both segments 
engines segment margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal pricing improvements  including the impact of the euro  added million to the engines segment margin 
manufacturing cost reduction programs contributed an additional million 
these positive margin enhancers were not enough to overcome a million increase in manufacturing costs  primarily overhead  raw materials and component costs  and a million decrease from a mix of lower margined product 
consistent with the prior year  the cost increases reflect initiatives by many vendors to pass along higher costs due to price pressures on scrap aluminum and steel 
the power products segment margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the acquisition of simplicity contributed gross margin in fiscal after the application of purchase accounting on acquired inventory 
murray sales were essentially at a zero margin after the application of purchase accounting  which reduced the overall segment margin by 
the margins on generators and pressure washers declined between years as the million impact of pricing improvements was offset by component and freight costs on expedited shipments to meet generator demand early in the year 
in addition  euro purchases reduced the gross margin of the power products segment by million 
under the company s foreign currency management program  this negative impact on margins was offset by the positive impact of the euro discussed for the engines segment 
engineering  selling  general and administrative costs engineering  selling  general and administrative costs increased million or compared to fiscal the write off of a trade receivable from murray  inc accounts for million of the increase 
the acquisition of simplicity added another million to the category 
the remaining increase is attributable to planned increases in advertising expenses  increased salaries and fringe benefits  and increased international variable selling costs  including million from the impact of a stronger euro 
interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is attributable to lower borrowings between years 
other income other income increased million between fiscal years and the increase is due to the receipt of million in cash dividends from an equity investment in preferred stock of metal technologies  inc  the entity that acquired two ductile foundries from the company in august of refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the details of the components of other income 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a tax benefit on dividend income in the current year 
extraordinary gain the extraordinary gain represents the difference between the estimated fair value of the selected assets acquired from murray and the cash paid  after all tax considerations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years  and cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
the fiscal cash flows from operating activities were million higher than the prior year 
the primary reason for the increase is lower working capital requirements in the current year 
lower fourth quarter sales in fiscal resulted in higher inventory levels offset by lower receivables and accrued liabilities including rebates  incentive compensation and income taxes 
the reduction in net income between years was more than offset by a series of increased non cash items in the current year including non cash pension charges  stock compensation expense  gains on fixed asset sales  the deferred tax credit  and the elimination of the extraordinary gain in the current year 
the fiscal cash flows from operations were million higher than the prior year 
fiscal did not experience the significant increase in inventories experienced in  resulting in a million improvement in cash flows in fiscal during fiscal  inventories for engines and power products were increased to what management believes are a more normal level 
accordingly  no such incremental inventory build up was required in fiscal offsetting the favorable impact of inventory levels on cash flows was a million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities between years 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million reduction in incentive compensation accruals between years and million in lower rebate accruals 
the fiscal cash flows from operating activities were million lower than the prior year 
fiscal experienced a significant increase in inventory levels  which reduced cash flows from operating activities by million in fiscal and million between years 
engine inventories increased million between years 
this increase is attributable to strong production levels through the end of the fiscal year driven by a strong selling season at retail 
in addition  we believed that the increased inventory was needed to meet our forecast for fiscal our power products segment also experienced an increase in inventory levels of million between years 
this increase in inventory reflects strong production levels throughout the year in order to replenish depleted inventories after the demand creating events for generators in fiscal pressure washer inventory levels reflected increasing demand for the product due to significant market growth in the category 
inventory on hand will always reflect demand and our ability to respond to market changes at our production facilities in a timely manner 
also contributing to the lower cash flows from operating activities in fiscal were increased receivables growth between years of million  which reflects our sales growth at both segments and timing of payments  lower payable increases between years of million and lower deferred tax provisions between years of million 
offsetting these reductions in cash flows in fiscal were increased earnings of million  a reduction in prepaid expenses between years of million and lower pension income of million 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these cash flows include capital expenditures of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures relate primarily to reinvestment in equipment  capacity additions and new products 
in fiscal  briggs stratton received million in cash from the sale of certain operating assets 
in addition  briggs stratton received million as a refund of a portion of the cash paid for certain assets of murray  inc in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in investing activities also includes million in cash paid for the simplicity acquisition and million for the acquisition of certain murray assets 
in fiscal  briggs stratton received million as a refund of a portion of the cash paid for the bsppg acquisition in fiscal the amount was to adjust the original purchase price for the actual value received in acquired receivables and inventory 
briggs stratton used cash of million through financing activities in fiscal briggs stratton provided cash from financing activities of million  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal the company paid off million of its long term debt  including million of its term notes due in fiscal in addition  briggs stratton re purchased million of its common shares in fiscal early in fiscal the company used its available cash to finance the acquisition of simplicity 
to finance the acquisition of the murray assets the company issued million in term notes in fiscal the company incurred million in fees in fiscal negotiating the term notes and an amendment to its revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  briggs stratton did not use its revolver to finance working capital needs 
during fiscal  the company received million from the exercise of stock options compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the stock and option activity is a direct reflection of the market value of the company s stock and option strike prices that encourage the exercise of the options 
future liquidity and capital resources briggs stratton has a million revolving credit facility that expires in may this credit facility will be used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and other financing needs 
this facility and briggs stratton s other indebtedness contain certain restrictive covenants described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on august   briggs stratton announced its intent to initiate repurchases of up to million of its common stock through open market transactions during fiscal and fiscal the timing and amount of actual purchases will depend upon the market price of the stock and certain governing loan covenants 
as of august   approximately million of common stock has been repurchased under this plan 
briggs stratton expects capital expenditures to be million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect our plans to continue to reinvest in equipment  new products  and capacity enhancements 
management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from future operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund briggs stratton s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
financial strategy management believes that the value of briggs stratton is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that briggs stratton has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that enhance revenues and provide a superior economic return 
several successful joint ventures and the acquisition of generac portable products  inc and simplicity are examples of our successful execution of this strategy 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  we should return capital to the capital providers through dividends and or stock buy backs 
off balance sheet arrangements briggs stratton has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
briggs stratton s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and certain employee benefit plans 
briggs stratton is subject to financial and operating restrictions in addition to certain financial covenants under its domestic debt agreements 
as is fully disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  these restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends  incur further indebtedness  create liens  enter into sale and or leaseback transactions  consolidate  sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets  and dispose of assets or the proceeds of our assets 
we believe we will remain in compliance with these covenants in fiscal briggs stratton has obligations concerning certain employee benefits including its pension plans  post retirement benefit obligations and deferred compensation arrangements 
all of these obligations are recorded on our balance sheets and disclosed more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases consulting agreement as of july   the company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than days 
other matters labor agreement briggs stratton has collective bargaining agreements with its unions 
these agreements expire at various times ranging from emissions the us environmental protection agency epa has developed national emission standards under a two phase process for small air cooled engines 
briggs stratton currently has a complete product offering which complies with the epa s phase i engine emission standards 
the phase ii program imposes more stringent standards over the useful life of the engine and has been phased in for class ii or greater cubic centimeter displacement engines and will be phased in through for class i under cubic centimeter displacement engines 
the majority of briggs stratton s engines are certified to be compliant with the epa s phase ii standards and all engines will be phase ii certified in the next year 
accordingly  briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the epa is also evaluating the development of phase iii standards to further reduce engine exhaust emissions and to control evaporative emissions from small off road engines and equipment they are used in 
a draft regulation is scheduled for publication by the end of calendar year we cannot predict the scope of any proposal or of the final regulations that the epa may ultimately adopt  and accordingly cannot estimate what  if any  impact such regulations could have on future financial performance 
the california air resources board carb adopted a tier regulation requiring additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions and also requiring new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 
the tier regulation is phased in between and depending upon the size of the engine and type of control 
while briggs stratton believes the cost of the regulation on a per engine basis may be significant  briggs stratton does not believe the regulation will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
this assessment is based on a number of factors  including federal regulation  which precludes other states from opting into the california standard  revisions the carb made to its adopted regulation from the proposal published in september in response to recommendations from briggs stratton and others in the regulated category  the fact that california represents a relatively small percentage of briggs stratton s engine sales and our ability and intention to pass increased costs associated with the carb regulation on to california consumers 
the european commission adopted an engine emission directive regulating exhaust emissions from engines manufactured by briggs stratton 
the directive parallels the regulation previously promulgated by the us epa 
stage was effective in february  and stage will be phased in from to  with some limited extensions available for specific size and type engines until briggs stratton s full european product line has been compliant with stage since briggs stratton has certified the majority of its class engines to be compliant with the stage standards and intends to have a full european product line compliant with stage in briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the directive will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies briggs stratton s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable and inventory reserves  as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to customer rebates  pension obligations  postretirement benefits  warranty  product liability  litigation and taxation 
the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
changes in these reserves may be required if actual experience differs from the original estimates 
the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal  state and foreign income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal  state and foreign taxing authorities periodically review the company s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded tax related assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations 
the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at july  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moody s aa or higher rated bonds  resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  including inflation assumptions and active management of the plan s invested assets 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  stockholders equity and expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the company uses a market related value of assets that recognizes the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets over a five year period 
as of july  the company had million of unrecognized asset gains associated with its market related value of assets and subject to amortization in future periods 
the funded status of the company s pension plan is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service 
at july  the projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
material differences may arise between the funded status of the plan and the recorded asset or liability as certain items that have an immediate impact on the projected benefit obligation are amortized over a longer period of time for balance sheet purposes using actuarial assumptions 
as of july  there were million in actuarial losses not reflected in the recorded asset or liability 
the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense or income are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the service and interest cost by million 
for pension benefits and postretirement benefits  actuarial gains and losses are accounted for in accordance with gaap 
accumulation of actuarial gains and losses results from differences in actual experience compared to original assumptions over several years for discount rates  health care cost trends  and other factors 
accumulated actuarial gains and losses are amortized over future periods  and as a result  will impact recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
refer to note for additional discussion 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
seeks to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs 
the statement requires such costs to be treated as a current period expense 
this statement became effective for the company on july  the adoption of sfas no 
does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

briggs stratton does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency briggs stratton s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against the japanese yen and the euro 
the yen is used to purchase engines from briggs stratton s joint venture 
briggs stratton purchases components in euros from third parties and receives euros for certain products sold to european customers 
briggs stratton s foreign subsidiaries earnings are also influenced by fluctuations of the local currency against the us dollar as these subsidiaries purchase inventory from the parent in us dollars 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to partially hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at july   briggs stratton had the following forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with the fair value gains losses shown in thousands hedge notional fair market conversion gain loss currency value value currency at fair value japanese yen us euro us australian dollars us all of the above contracts expire within twelve months 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the shareholders investment in briggs stratton 
amounts invested in briggs stratton s non us subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated into non us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at fiscal year end 
the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders investment as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cumulative translation adjustments component of shareholders investment increased million during the year 
using the year end exchange rates  the total amount invested in non us subsidiaries on july  was million 
interest rates briggs stratton is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings  depending on general economic conditions 
on july   briggs stratton had the following short term loans outstanding in thousands weighted average currency amount interest rate us dollars euro these loans carry variable interest rates 
assuming borrowings are outstanding for an entire year  an increase decrease of one percentage point in the weighted average interest rate  would increase decrease interest expense by thousand 
long term loans  net of unamortized discount  consisted of the following in thousands description amount maturity senior notes senior notes variable rate term notes the senior notes carry fixed rates of interest and are therefore not subject to market fluctuation 
the variable rate term note is subject to interest rate fluctuations  therefore an increase decrease of one percentage point in the weighted average interest rate would increase decrease interest expense by thousand
