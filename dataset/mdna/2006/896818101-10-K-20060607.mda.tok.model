item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer and manufacture a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems for the global aerospace oem market  and ii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul services of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
financial highlights for fiscal net sales for fiscal year increased to million operating income in fiscal year increased to million income from continuing operations for fiscal year increased to million year end backlog reached a new record high of million  up over prior year 
for fiscal year  net sales totaled million  a increase from fiscal year net sales of million 
income from continuing operations for fiscal year increased to million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal year our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
we have recently received several important new contract awards including our subsidiary  triumph actuation systems  llc formerly frisby aerospace  llc  has been awarded a contract by saab aerostructures to provide the boeing large cargo door actuation system lcdas 
the lcdas is a collaborative effort of multiple triumph group companies working to provide a system solution for the program 
the agreement has an estimated value of up to million over the life of the program  however our year end backlog at march  does not include any value associated with this program  as we do not currently have firm delivery dates 
our subsidiary  triumph composite systems  inc  has been awarded a multi year supply agreement with vought aircraft industries  inc  a structural integration partner in the boeing program 
this agreement involves providing a wide variety of aerospace products  including composite ducting  machined metal parts and fittings  window assemblies  hydraulic tubing insulation and other section components in support of vought s workshare on the boeing aircraft 
this award has an estimated value in excess of million over the life of the program  however our year end backlog at march  does not include any value associated with this program  as we do not currently have firm delivery dates 
our subsidiary  triumph structures los angeles  inc  has been awarded a full rate production contract by bae systems  inc to supply m mm lightweight howitzer gun body units 
this award has an estimated value of million over the next four years 
the m mm lightweight howitzer is a towed artillery weapon  designed to provide fire support for light and medium us forces 
triumph structures los angeles has been providing the gun body units to bae systems under a low rate initial production contract for guns 
outlook sales for fiscal are expected to grow to be in the range of million to million  and earnings per share for fiscal are expected to be between to 
our fiscal outlook is based on the following market assumptions the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share  and traditional airlines continue to improve their competitive position by lowering their cost structure through merger usairways america west  bankruptcy delta airlines and restructuring american airlines 
some of the airline restructurings have led to increased outsourcing opportunies  benefiting our aftermarket services segment 
aircraft seat miles  a key indicator of airline health  continued to improve  up in calendar  positively affecting our business 
finally  recent upward movement in airline ticket prices  which are being sustained  should help stabilize airlines financial position 
air cargo continues to exhibit strong growth and financial stability  a key market segment for us given our product penetration with these carriers 
the major trends that shape the current military defense environment include significant but relatively flat us government defense and space budgets  rapid expansion of information and communication technologies  and the need for low cost  assured access to space 
the us department of defense dod authorization was approved in the fourth quarter of at a total level of billion excluding supplementals 
although under pressure  the dod budget remains strong and focused on transformation 
with this continued pressure on the budget the dod will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network centric operations  joint interoperability  long range strike  unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles  precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
deliveries of airbus and boeing large commercial aircraft are expected to be significantly higher in calendar  compared to calendar airbus and boeing reported actual deliveries for calendar of aircraft 
their deliveries for calendar are expected to increase by approximately  to about aircraft 
capacity in the global airline system  as measured by available seat miles asms  is expected to continue to grow 
we expect global asm growth of about in calendar  compared to calendar our sales to airlines for large commercial and regional aircraft aftermarket parts and service are expected to grow approximately proportionately with increases in capacity 
total regional and business aircraft production is expected to be relatively flat in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as deliveries of business jets are expected to increase  offsetting the expected decrease in regional aircraft deliveries 
in the regional aircraft market we expect to see growth in the seat segment offset by continued weakness in the seat products 
military sales oem and aftermarket are expected to increase roughly in line with global military budgets  which are expected to be flat or grow in the low single digit range for calendar  compared to calendar results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  dollars in thousands net sales segment operating income corporate general and administrative expenses total operating income interest expense and other income tax expense income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income changes in net sales and segment operating income are discussed within the business segment performance section below 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to rent expense and other costs associated with idle facilities as well as increased staffing  incentive compensation expense and costs associated with acquisitions that we pursued but did not complete  partially offset by decreased regulatory costs 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average borrowings outstanding and less foreign exchange losses  partially offset by increased interest rates on our credit facility and industrial revenue bonds  and higher imputed interest on our liability related to our purchase of the revenue sharing program position on the cfm the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal and effective tax rates vary from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to benefits realized from the research and development tax credit and the extraterritorial income eti exclusion 
fiscal also includes a million reduction of income tax expense resulting from adjusting the income tax rate at which reversals of temporary differences will be taxed and a million reduction of income tax expense resulting from completion of income tax audits 
loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal the benefit for income taxes from discontinued operations was million in fiscal during fiscal  we sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our metals businesses metals for cash proceeds of million and recorded a million loss on the sale of these businesses 
the businesses that comprise the discontinued operations manufacture  machine  process and distribute metal products to customers in the computer  container and office furniture industries  primarily within north america  in addition to providing structural steel erection services 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  dollars in thousands net sales segment operating income corporate general and administrative expenses total operating income interest expense and other income tax expense income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income changes in net sales and segment operating income are discussed within the business segment performance section below 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to increased audit and other expenses to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense and other increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to increased interest rates partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal and effective tax rates vary from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to benefits realized from the research and development tax credit and the extraterritorial income eti exclusion 
loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal compared with a loss from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for fiscal  resulting in a change of million  due to a loss on the sale of the assets of million partially offset by operating profits primarily resulting from higher selling prices due to the increased global demand for steel 
the benefit for income taxes from discontinued operations was million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in fiscal business segment performance we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer and manufacture a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems for the global aerospace oem market  and ii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul services of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
our aerospace systems segment consists of operating locations  and the aftermarket services segment consists of operating locations at march  prior to its elimination on march   due to the shutdown  sale or transfer of assets to our other operating segments  we had a third operating segment  known as the other segment  which consisted of operating locations 
the aerospace systems segment consists of the company s operations which manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the aerospace systems operations design and engineer mechanical and electromechanical controls  such as hydraulic systems  main engine gearbox assemblies  accumulators and mechanical control cables 
the aerospace systems revenues are also derived from stretch forming  die forming  milling  bonding  machining  welding and assembly and fabrication of various structural components used in aircraft wings  fuselages and other significant assemblies 
further  the segment s operations also manufacture metallic and composite bonded honeycomb assemblies for floor panels  fuselage  wings and flight control surface parts 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aftermarket services segment consists of the company s operations that provide maintenance  repair and overhaul services to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
maintenance  repair and overhaul revenues are derived from services on auxiliary power units  aircraft accessories  including constant speed drives  cabin compressors  starters and generators  and pneumatic drive units 
in addition  the aftermarket services operations repair and overhaul thrust reversers  nacelle components and other aerostructures 
the aftermarket services operations also perform repair and overhaul services  and supply spare parts  for various types of cockpit instruments and gauges for a broad range of commercial airlines on a worldwide basis 
the other segment s operations and assets  primarily comprised of the industrial gas turbine igt businesses  manufactured or repaired and overhauled igt components  primarily for oems and power generation equipment operators  and applied high temperature coatings for both internal and external customers 
these operations and assets have been sold  liquidated  or re deployed to the other two remaining segments  and were not a reportable segment after march  business segment performance fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  of total sales change dollars in thousands net sales aerospace systems aftermarket services other n a elimination of inter segment sales total net sales year ended march  of segment sales change dollars in thousands segment operating income aerospace systems aftermarket services other n a total segment operating income aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to the increased sales of large structural precision components and assemblies for the aerospace and defense markets and cabin windows for the general aviation and corporate jet markets resulting from increased production of both commercial and military aircraft 
aerospace systems segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating income increased due to higher sales volume as described above and improved sales mix  primarily for structural precision components partially offset by an increase in staffing  depreciation and amortization expenses  incentive compensation expense and increased investments in research and development costs 
aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to growth in global commercial air traffic and us military maintenance demand resulting in increased demands for our repair and overhaul services 
aftermarket services segment operating income decreased by million  or  to a loss of million for fiscal from income of million for fiscal operating income decreased primarily due to an increase in staffing  depreciation expense  losses associated with customer bankruptcies  compensation expense  costs incurred in developing products associated with new aerospace programs and costs associated with the construction of our new thailand maintenance and repair facility 
other segment effective march   we no longer have other as a reportable segment 
as of march  the other segment operations had ceased and any residual assets were transferred to other company facilities 
during the year ended march   the other segment had sales primarily related to its igt operations of million 
during the year ended march   the other segment incurred an operating loss of million primarily as a result from falling sales to both oems and power generation equipment operators in the igt market 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  of total sales change dollars in thousands net sales aerospace systems aftermarket services other elimination of inter segment sales total net sales year ended march  of segment sales change dollars in thousands segment operating income aerospace systems aftermarket services other total segment operating income aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to the sales increase of million associated with the acquisitions of parker hannifin s united aircraft products division  renamed triumph thermal systems  in may and rolls royce gear systems  inc  renamed triumph gear systems  inc  from rolls royce north america venture i inc 
in january collectively  the acquisitions completed in fiscal  and an increase in same store sales of million due to the increased manufacturing of large structural precision components and assemblies for the aerospace and ground defense markets and cabin windows for the general aviation and corporate jet market as a result of customer demand related to increased production of both commercial and military aircraft 
aerospace systems segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating income increased due to the acquisitions as discussed above  which showed a year over year increase of approximately million  partially offset by increases in healthcare costs  research and development and depreciation and amortization expenses and legal expenses associated with the trade secret litigation totaling approximately million 
aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to growth in global commercial air traffic and us military maintenance demand which created increased demand for the repair and overhaul of auxiliary power units as well as the brokering of similar units  and the inclusion of the net sales of the casting business formerly a part of the other segment in this segment 
since we made a decision to exit the igt market  the casting business has transitioned its target market away from igt products and shifted its focus to the production of aerospace products in fiscal accordingly  the fiscal results of the casting business are included in the aftermarket services segment 
the fiscal results of the casting business are included in the other segment 
these actions are collectively referred to in this discussion as the casting business realignment 
aftermarket services segment operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was due to the million operating loss of the casting business in fiscal as a result of the casting business realignment  and an increase in staffing  healthcare and other costs associated with the increase in business activity 
other segment the other segment net sales decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this was a result of our decision to exit the igt business and stop taking sales orders relative to this particular market 
the other segment incurred an operating loss of million for fiscal compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal this improvement was primarily due to the effect of the casting business realignment  which included a million operating loss of the casting business in fiscal significant charges and costs of million associated with the restructuring steps taken to exit the igt business were incurred in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
during fiscal  we amended and restated our existing credit agreement as amended and restated  the credit facility with its lenders to reduce the credit facility to million from million  extend the maturity date to july  and amend certain other terms and covenants 
the credit facility bears interest at either i libor plus between and or ii the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus if greater plus between and or iii an overnight rate at our option 
the applicable interest rate is based upon our ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and on the unused portion of the credit facility 
we may allocate up to million of the available credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit 
our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility 
on march   an aggregate amount of approximately million was outstanding under the credit facility  million of which was accruing interest at libor plus applicable basis points totaling per annum  and million of which was accruing interest at the overnight interest rate of per annum 
amounts repaid under the credit facility may be reborrowed 
during fiscal  we entered into a loan agreement with the city of shelbyville  indiana related to the city of shelbyville  indiana economic development revenue bonds  series the bonds 
the proceeds of the bonds of up to million are being used to fund the expansion of one of our subsidiary s facilities and to retire the remaining outstanding bonds from the loan agreement dated may  with the city of shelbyville  indiana relating to the city of shelbyville  indiana adjustable rate economic development revenue bonds  series the bonds are due to mature on october  and bear interest at a variable rate equal to approximately ninety percent of the three month libor rate the effective rate was at march  
capital expenditures were approximately million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be to million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
during fiscal  we prepaid million of principal of the senior notes as a result of cash proceeds from the sale of triwestern metals as prescribed by the amended note purchase agreement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we paid million related to a contract signed with general electric to provide the inlet gearbox as well as specific related spare parts for the cfm engine program for the life of the program 
we expect to pay approximately million in additional consideration through april related to the contract 
the cash paid was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   we announced a program to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
from the inception of the program through march   we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total purchase price of million 
in april  we acquired all of the assets of excel manufacturing  inc  renamed triumph structures wichita  which is located in wichita  kansas 
in may  we acquired substantially all of the assets of air excellence international  inc  renamed triumph interiors  which is headquartered in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
the combined purchase price for these assets  which was paid in cash at the closings of approximately million  was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years debt principal debt interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total included in our balance sheet at march  includes interest component 
includes fixed rate interest only 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisition and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated  our credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with invoice terms  generally when completed products or repaired parts are shipped 
our policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at our option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
if actual future sales returns  allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience  additional amounts may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
for our impairment test  we use market multiples from an external source for an average of stock price to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for certain companies in the aerospace and defense markets in computing the fair value of each reporting unit 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
no impairment charges have been incurred since the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  which adopts language from the international accounting standards board s iasb international accounting standard no 
inventories in an effort to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting 
the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact that this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the company intends to adopt sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method beginning on april   and therefore  will begin to expense the fair value of all outstanding options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options are not fully vested as of the adoption date and will expense the fair value of all future options granted subsequent to march  over their service periods 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as currently required 
the company estimates it will record pre tax share based compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal this estimate may be impacted by potential changes to the structure of the company s share based compensation plans which could impact the number of stock options granted in fiscal  changes in valuation assumptions  the market price of the company s common stock  among other things and  as a result  the actual pre tax share based compensation expense in fiscal may differ from the company s current estimate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effects 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including our revolving credit facility 
we try to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rate as of march  variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor  federal funds rates and other weekly rates and represent the weighted average rate at march  expected years of maturity next months months months months months there after total fixed rate cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rate variable rate cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rate there are no other significant market risk exposures 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management s beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers as well as competitive factors relating to the aviation and metals industries
