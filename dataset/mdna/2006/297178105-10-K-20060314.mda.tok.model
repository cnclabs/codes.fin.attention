average same property monthly rental rate per apartment unit represents total scheduled rent for the same property apartment units for the period actual rental rates on occupied apartment units plus market rental rates on vacant apartment units divided by the number of such apartment units and further divided by the number of months in the period 
average same property monthly expenses per apartment unit represents total monthly operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  for the same property apartment units for the period divided by the total number of such apartment units and further divided by the number of months in the period 
occupancy rates are based on financial occupancy 
for an explanation of how financial occupancy is calculated  see properties occupancy rates in item of part i of this form k 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
these consolidated financial statements include all adjustments which are  in the opinion of management  necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature 
overview the company is a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  that acquires  develops  redevelops and manages multifamily residential properties in selected communities located primarily in the west coast of the united states 
the company owns all of its interests in its real properties  directly or indirectly  through the operating partnership 
the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and  as of december   had an approximately general partner interest in the operating partnership 
our investment strategy has two components constant monitoring of existing markets  and evaluation of new markets to identify areas with the characteristics that underlie rental growth 
our strong financial condition supports our investment strategy by enhancing our ability to quickly shift our acquisition  development  and disposition activities to markets that will optimize the performance of the portfolio 
by region  the company s operating results and rent growth analysis are as follows southern california region as of december   we had ownership interests in this region representing of our multifamily units 
during the year ended december   the region continued to perform well  as same property as defined below revenues increased compared to the company expects new residential supply of  single family homes and  multi family units which represents a total new supply of of existing stock 
the company expects this region to generate positive rent growth of approximately in northern california region as of december   the company had ownership interests in this region representing of its multifamily units 
the region improved from a decrease in same property revenues of in compared to  to an increase in same property revenues of in compared to the company expects new residential supply of  single family homes and  multi family units which represents a total new supply of of existing stock 
the company expects this region to generate positive rent growth of approximately in pacific northwest region as of december   the company had ownership interests in this region representing of its multifamily units 
the region improved from an increase in same property revenues of in compared to  to an increase in same property revenues of in compared to the company expects new residential supply of  single family homes and  multi family units which represents a total new supply of of existing stock 
the company expects this region to generate positive rent growth of approximately in as of december   we had ownership interests in multifamily properties  comprising  apartment units 
our multifamily residential properties are located in three major west coast regions southern california los angeles  ventura  orange  riverside and san diego counties northern california the san francisco bay area pacific northwest seattle  washington and portland  oregon metropolitan areas the company s consolidated multifamily properties are as follows as of december  as of december  number of apartment homes number of apartment homes southern california northern california pacific northwest other total at december   we also had ownership interests in three office buildings with approximately  square feet  three recreational vehicle parks comprising spaces and one manufactured housing community containing sites 
we currently have three development projects and other pre development projects in our pipeline  aggregating units  with total incurred costs as of december  of million and estimated remaining costs of approximately million 
these consolidated development projects are northwest gateway  in los angeles  california consisting of units 
moorpark  in ventura county  california consisting of units 
tuscana  in tracy  california consisting of units 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  average financial occupancy rates of the company s multifamily stabilized properties or same properties properties consolidated by the company for each of the years ended december  and increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue 
actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions 
total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units  with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents 
we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 
financial occupancy may not completely reflect short term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 
the regional breakdown of the company s same property portfolio for financial occupancy for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  southern california northern california

 the results of operations of those properties are reported as a component of discontinued operations for  and liquidity and capital resources standard and poor s and fitch ratings have existing issuer credit ratings of bbb stable for essex property trust  inc and essex portfolio lp at december   the company had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that cash flows generated by our operations  existing cash balances  availability under existing lines of credit  access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the timing  source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment  which can affect our plans for acquisitions  dispositions  development and redevelopment activities 
non revenue generating capital expenditures are improvements and upgrades that extend the useful life of the property 
for the year ended december   non revenue generating capital expenditures totaled approximately per unit 
the company expects to incur approximately per unit in non revenue generating capital expenditures for the year ended december  these expenditures do not include the improvements required in connection with the origination of mortgage loans  expenditures for deferred maintenance on acquisition properties  expenditures for property renovations and improvements which are expected to generate additional revenue  and renovation expenditures required pursuant to tax exempt bond financings 
the company expects that cash from operations and or its lines of credit will fund such expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the actual expenditures incurred during and or the funding thereof will not be significantly different than the company s current expectations 
the company is currently developing three multifamily residential projects  with an aggregate of units 
such projects involve certain risks inherent in real estate development 
see discussion under caption risks that development activities will be delayed or not completed and or fail to achieve expected results in item a  risk factors  of this form k 
in connection with these development projects  the company has directly  or in some cases through its joint venture partners entered into contractual construction related commitments with unrelated third parties and the total projected estimated cost for these projects is approximately million 
as of december   the remaining commitment to fund these development projects is approximately million 
the company expects to fund such commitments by using a combination of some or all of the following sources its working capital  amounts available on its lines of credit  net proceeds from public and private equity and debt issuances  and proceeds from the disposition of properties  if any 
our redevelopment strategy strives to improve the financial and physical aspects of our redevelopment apartment communities and to target a to percent return on the incremental renovation investment 
many of the company s properties are older and in excellent neighborhoods  providing lower density with large floor plans that represent attractive redevelopment opportunities 
as of december   we had six communities  aggregating  units in various stages of redevelopment 
total redevelopment cost of these projects as of december  is approximately million  of which million remains to be expended 
essex had a million unsecured line of credit as of december   and was outstanding with an average interest rate on the line of credit of approximately 
this facility matures in april  with an option for a one year extension 
the underlying interest rate on this line is based on a tiered rate structure tied to our corporate ratings and is currently libor plus 
we also have a million credit facility from freddie mac  which is secured by six of essex s multifamily communities 
as of december   we had million outstanding under this line of credit  which bears an average interest rate of percent and matures in january the underlying interest rate on this line is between and basis points over the freddie mac reference rate 
fund ii obtained a credit facility during the first quarter of  aggregating million  and during the second quarter of fund ii amended the credit facility increasing the facility to million 
this line bears interest at libor plus  and matures in june  as of december   we had the capacity to issue up to million in equity securities  and the operating partnership had the capacity to issue up to million of debt securities under our existing shelf registration statements 
during october and november  the company s operating partnership  essex portfolio  lp  raised million from the sale of exchangeable senior notes the notes with a coupon of due on or after november   the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holder into cash and  in certain circumstances at essex s option  shares of company s common stock at an initial exchange price of per share subject to certain adjustments 
the notes will also be exchangeable prior to november   but only upon the occurrence of certain specified events 
on or after november   the operating partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest  if any 
note holders may require the operating partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest  if any on the notes on november   november  and november  with the proceeds from the sale of the notes  the company repurchased million in common stock and paid down million on the outstanding lines of credit 
in part using proceeds from the sale of notes  in the fourth quarter of  the company paid off ten mortgage notes payable totaling million with fixed rates ranging from to  and the company originated two new mortgage notes payable totaling million with fixed rates of and 
as of december   our mortgage notes payable totaled billion  which consisted of million in fixed rate debt with interest rates varying from to and maturity dates ranging from to and million of tax exempt variable rate demand bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 
the tax exempt variable rate demand bonds have maturity dates ranging from to  and are subject to interest rate caps 
the company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution 
until it is distributed  cash available for distribution is invested by the company primarily in short term investment grade securities or is used by the company to reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit 
in an effort to hedge the cash flows associated with the forecasted issuance of debt expected to occur in and  on february   essex entered into a million notional forward starting swap with a commercial bank at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before october  additionally  on august   essex entered into a million notional forward starting swap with a commercial bank at a fixed rate of and a settlement date on or before october  on february   the company entered into additional notional forward starting swaps 
the first was for million with a commercial bank at a fixed rate of and a settlement date on or before january  the second and third swaps are for a total of million with two commercial banks at a fixed rate of and a settlement date on or before january  these derivatives will be used to economically hedge the cash flows associated with the refinancing of debt that matures in and  respectively there can be no assurance that essex will have access to the debt and equity markets in a timely fashion to meet such future funding requirements 
future working capital and borrowings under the lines of credit may not be available  or if available  may not be sufficient to meet the company s requirements  and we may not be able to sell properties in a timely manner and under terms and conditions that we deem acceptable 
alternative capital sources the essex apartment value fund ii fund ii  a value added discretionary fund  is essex s investment vehicle subject to certain exceptions until october   or when fund ii s committed capital has been invested  whichever occurs first 
fund ii invests in multifamily properties in the company s targeted west coast markets with a focus on investment opportunities in the seattle metropolitan area and the san francisco bay area 
fund ii announced its final closing on partner equity commitments on september  there are eight institutional investors including essex with combined partner equity commitments of million 
essex has committed million  which represents a interest as general partner and limited partner 
fund ii expects to utilize leverage equal to approximately of the estimated value of the underlying real estate 
consistent with fund i  essex will record revenue for its asset management  property management  development and redevelopment services  and promote distributions if fund ii s returns exceed certain financial return benchmarks 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes the maturation or due dates of our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods and and in thousands thereafter total mortgage notes payable exchangeable bonds lines of credit interest on indebtedness development commitments redevelopment commitments essex apartment value fund ii  lp capital commitment variable interest entities consolidated variable interest entities in accordance fin r  the company consolidates emc  efc  down reit limited partnerships comprising ten properties  an office building that is subject to loans made by the company  and the multifamily improvements owned by a third party in which the company owns the land underlying these improvements and from which the company receives fees  including land lease  subordination and property management fees  and a joint venture to develop a building in los angeles  california 
the company consolidated these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under fin r 
the company s total assets and liabilities related to these variable interest entities vies  net of intercompany eliminations  were approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  interest holders in vies consolidated by the company are allocated net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow 
the remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the company 
properties consolidated in accordance with fin r were encumbered by third party  non recourse loans totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
unconsolidated variable interest entities as of december  the company is involved with four vies  of which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
total assets and liabilities of these entities as of december  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company does not have a significant exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with these unconsolidated vies 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities  ii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  iii internal cost capitalization  iv and qualification as a reit 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie 
if such an entity is a vie  then the company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary 
if the company is the primary beneficiary  then the entity is consolidated 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental  and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 
rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation components on rental properties have been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from to years using the straight line method 
development costs include acquisition  direct and indirect construction costs  interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods 
maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred 
asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures  and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development 
local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable  the carrying amount is evaluated 
if the sum of the property s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property  then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges 
when the company determines that a property is held for sale  it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property 
the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  incurred during development and redevelopment activities 
interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use 
the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting  legal fees  and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 
forward looking statements certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k which are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions  beliefs and strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding the company s expectations as to the timing of completion of current development and redevelopment projects and the stabilization dates of such projects  expectation as to the total projected costs and rental rates of development and redevelopment projects  beliefs as to the adequacy of future cash flows to meet operating requirements and to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements  expectations as to the amount of capital expenditures  expectations as to the amount of non revenue generating capital expenditures  future acquisitions  the company s anticipated development projects in  the anticipated performance of the second essex apartment value fund fund ii  the anticipated performance of existing properties  anticipated results from various geographic regions and the company s investment focus in such regions  statements regarding the company s financing activities  and the use of proceeds from such activities 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors including  but not limited to  that the company will fail to achieve its business objectives  that the actual completion of development projects will be subject to delays  that the stabilization dates of such projects will be delayed  that the total projected costs of current development projects will exceed expectations  that the company s development strategy will change  that such development projects will not be completed  that development projects and acquisitions will fail to meet expectations  that estimates of future income from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate  that future cash flows will be inadequate to meet operating requirements and or will be insufficient to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements  that the actual non revenue generating capital expenditures will exceed the company s current expectations  that the company s partners in fund ii fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required  that there may be a downturn in the markets in which the company s properties are located  that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness  as well as those risks  special considerations  and other factors discussed under the caption potential factors affecting future operating results below and those discussed in item a  risk factors  of this form k  and those risk factors and special considerations set forth in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are made as of today  and the company assumes no obligation to update this information 
potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a 
of this annual report on form k and the following development and redevelopment activities the company pursues multifamily residential properties and development and redevelopment projects from time to time 
these projects generally require various government and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
the company s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks  including the following funds may be expended and management s time devoted to projects that may not be completed  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible  projects may be delayed due to  among other things  adverse weather conditions  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and expenses at a completed development project may be higher than anticipated 
these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company s stockholders 
further  the development and redevelopment of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments 
interest rate fluctuations the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective 
however  current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with higher historical levels 
the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the company s variable interest rate debt 
the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company s ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the company s ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 
funds from operations ffo ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry 
essex presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure 
ffo is not used by essex as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of essex s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of essex s ability to fund its cash needs 
ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does essex intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
essex believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  essex believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 
in calculating ffo  essex follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits nareit  which is a reit trade association 
essex believes that  under the nareit ffo definition  the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties 
essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented 
however  other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure  and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to essex s calculation 
the following table sets forth the company s calculation of ffo for and for the year ended for the quarter ended net income adjustments depreciation and amortization co investments gain on sale of real estate gain on sale of real estate discontinued operations gain on sale of co investment activities  net

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows 
management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december  because interest rates  yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments 
management has estimated that the fair value of the company s billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds at december  is approximately billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 
for the years ended december thereafter total fair value in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate libor debt average interest rate  covered by a forward starting swap at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before october   covered by a forward starting swap at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before october  also  effective february   covered by a forward starting swap at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before january  effective february   covered by two forward starting swaps at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before january   subject to interest rate caps 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates 
the company s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount
