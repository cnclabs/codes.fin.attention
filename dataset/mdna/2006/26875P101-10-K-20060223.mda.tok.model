item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview eog resources  inc eog is one of the largest independent non integrated oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states  canada  offshore trinidad and the united kingdom north sea 
eog operates under a consistent strategy which focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return  drilling internally generated prospects  delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
net income available to common for of  million was up compared to net income available to common of million  attributable primarily to higher commodity prices and increased production 
at december   eog s total reserves were trillion cubic feet equivalent  an increase of billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe from december  operations several important developments have occurred since january  united states and canada 
the fort worth  texas office was opened in to expand on eog s drilling success in the barnett shale play of the fort worth basin 
eog has successfully expanded the play beyond its conventional limits by using horizontal drilling and enhanced completion technology 
by year end  eog had over  acres under lease in several counties 
eog plans on substantially increasing its drilling program in eog s effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada 
eog plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays  which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eog s crude oil and natural gas production 
eog has several larger potential plays under way in wyoming  utah  texas  oklahoma and western canada 
international 
during  eog commenced natural gas production in trinidad to supply two new long term contracts 
first  eog is supplying natural gas that is being used as feedstock for the m methanol plant which commenced operations in september second  the atlantic lng train alng began taking gas in december  prior to commercial operations  and volumes supplied by eog during this pre start up period have been higher than eog s contractual rate 
although eog continues to focus on united states and canada natural gas  eog sees an increasing linkage between united states and canada natural gas demand and trinidad natural gas supply 
for example  liquefied natural gas lng imports from existing and planned facilities in trinidad are serious contenders to meet increasing united states demand 
in addition  ammonia  methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the united states and canada to trinidad  driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation 
eog believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to the two ammonia plants  the new methanol plant and the alng  will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to united states and canada natural gas fundamentals 
in  eog continued its progress in the southern gas basin of the united kingdom north sea 
production commenced in january from the arthur well and in july from the arthur well 
the arthur well is expected to spud in the first half of eog expects only modest activity in due to the difficulty in obtaining rigs in the north sea 
capital structure as noted  one of management s key strategies is to keep a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio 
at december   eog s debt to total capitalization ratio was  down from at year end by primarily utilizing cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from stock options exercised in  eog funded its  million exploration and development expenditures  paid down million of debt and paid dividends to common shareholders of million 
in addition  in  eog s board of directors increased the cash dividend on common stock to an annual rate of per share  which represents a increase in the annual cash dividend 
as management currently assesses price forecast and demand trends for  eog believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can essentially be funded by cash from operations 
for  eog s estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately billion  excluding acquisitions 
united states and canada natural gas continues to be a key component of this effort 
when it fits eog s strategy  eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration and or production opportunities 
management believes that eog continues to maintain one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog s history 
the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning with page f results of operations net operating revenues during  net operating revenues increased  million to  million from  million in total wellhead revenues  which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids  increased  million  or  to  million as compared to  million in natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids revenues solely represent wellhead revenues for these products 
wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended december  were as follows natural gas volumes mmcfd united states canada trinidad united kingdom total average natural gas prices mcf united states canada trinidad united kingdom composite crude oil and condensate volumes mbbld united states canada trinidad united kingdom total average crude oil and condensate prices bbl united states canada trinidad united kingdom composite natural gas liquids volumes mbbld united states canada total average natural gas liquids prices bbl united states canada composite natural gas equivalent volumes mmcfed united states canada trinidad united kingdom total total bcfe deliveries million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day  as applicable

million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent  as applicable  includes natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids 
compared to wellhead natural gas revenues for increased  million  or  to  million from  million for due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price million  increased natural gas deliveries million and a second quarter revenue adjustment related to an amended trinidad take or pay contract million 
the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased to per mcf for from per mcf in excluding the aforementioned adjustment  the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased to per mcf for this adjustment increased the average trinidad wellhead natural gas price by per mcf for natural gas deliveries increased mmcfd  or  to  mmcfd for from  mmcfd in the increase was due to higher production of mmcfd in the united states  mmcfd in trinidad  mmcfd in the united kingdom and mmcfd in canada 
the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas mmcfd and louisiana mmcfd 
the increase in trinidad was due to the increased contractual requirements and demand related to the ammonia and methanol plants 
the increase in the united kingdom was due to the commencement of production from the arthur field in january mmcfd and the full year production from the valkyrie field  which commenced production in august mmcfd 
the increase in canada was attributable to the drilling program  primarily in the wapiti  drumheller and connorsville areas 
wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased million  or  to million from million as compared to  due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price million and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries million 
the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for was per barrel compared to per barrel for natural gas liquids revenues increased million  or  to million from million as compared to  due to increases in the composite average price million and deliveries million 
during  eog recognized gains on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of million  which included realized gains of million 
during  eog recognized losses on mark to market financial commodity derivative contracts of million  which included realized losses of million and collar premium payments of million 
compared to wellhead natural gas revenues for increased million  or  to  million from  million for due to increases in natural gas deliveries million and the composite average wellhead natural gas price million 
the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased to per mcf for from per mcf in natural gas deliveries increased mmcfd  or  to  mmcfd for from mmcfd in  due to a mmcfd  or  increase in canada  a mmcfd  or  increase in trinidad  and a mmcfd increase in the united kingdom due to commencement of production in august  partially offset by a mmcfd  or decline in the united states 
the increased deliveries in canada mmcfd were attributable to property acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of and additional production related to post acquisition drilling 
the increase in trinidad was attributable to the increased production from the u a block mmcfd which began supplying natural gas in mid to the n ammonia plant and commencement of production from the parula wells on the secc block in february mmcfd 
wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased million  or  to million from million as compared to  due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price million and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries million 
the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for was per barrel compared to per barrel for wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries increased mbbld  or  to mbbld from mbbld for the increase was mainly due to production from new wells in the united states mbbld and higher production in trinidad from the parula wells mbbld and from the u a block as a result of new production mbbld 
natural gas liquids revenues were million higher than a year ago primarily due to increases in deliveries million and the composite average price million

operating and other expenses compared to during  operating expenses of  million were million higher than the  million incurred in the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december lease and well  including transportation depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a general and administrative g a taxes other than income interest expense  net total per unit costs total per unit costs do not include exploration costs  dry hole costs and impairments 
the per unit costs of lease and well  including transportation  dd a  taxes other than income and interest expense  net for compared to were due primarily to the reasons set forth below 
lease and well expense includes expenses for eog operated properties  as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property 
lease and well expense can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eog s oil and natural gas wells  the cost of workovers  transportation costs associated with selling hydrocarbon products and lease and well administrative expenses 
operating and maintenance expenses include  among other service costs  pumping services  salt water disposal  equipment repair and maintenance  compression expense  lease upkeep  fuel and power 
workovers are costs to restore or maintain production from existing wells 
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient  safe and environmentally responsible operations 
eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas 
operating costs within these existing and new areas  as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors  fluctuate over time 
lease and well expenses  including transportation  of million were million higher than due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states million  increased transportation related costs in the united states million and the united kingdom million  higher lease and well administrative expenses in the united states million  changes in the canadian exchange rate million  and higher workover expenditures in the united states million and trinidad million 
dd a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
eog s dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact an individual field  such as the field production profile  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  reserve revisions upward or downward  primarily related to well performance  and impairments 
changes to the individual fields  due to any of these factors  may cause eog s composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 
dd a expenses of million were million higher than primarily as a result of increased production in the united states million  canada million and trinidad million and the commencement of production in the united kingdom million 
dd a rates increased in the united states due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties million and in canada predominantly from the development of acquired proved reserves million 
the canadian exchange rate also contributed to the dd a expense increase million 
taxes other than income include severance production taxes  ad valorem property taxes  payroll taxes  franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes 
taxes other than income of million were million higher than severance production taxes increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues in the united states million  trinidad million and canada million  partially offset by the increase in credits taken for a texas high cost gas severance tax exemption million and a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of million 
other items contributing to the increase were an additional trinidadian supplemental petroleum tax expense as a result of tax legislation that increased the tax expense retroactively to january million and production tax relief in trinidad million 
ad valorem property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the united states million 
net interest expense in included costs associated with the early retirement of notes million see note to consolidated financial statements 
excluding these early retirement costs  the net interest expense decreased million compared to primarily due to higher capitalized interest million  an interest charge related to the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of million and lower average debt balance in the united states million 
exploration costs of million were million higher than due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the barnett shale area 
impairments include amortization of unproved leases  as well as impairments under the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long lived assets based on future cash flow analysis 
impairments of million were million lower than due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the united states million and lower impairments to the carrying value of certain long lived assets in canada million  partially offset by higher impairments to the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the united states million and higher amortization of unproved leases in canada million 
eog recorded impairments of million and million for and  respectively  under sfas no 
for certain properties in the united states and canada 
other income  net of million increased million compared to primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of properties million  interest income million and equity income from investments in the caribbean nitrogen company limited cncl and nitrogen unlimited n ammonia plants in million  decreased net foreign currency transaction losses million  and a gain on the sale of part of eog s interest in the n ammonia plant in the first quarter of million 
income tax provision of million increased million as compared to  due primarily to higher pre tax income million and income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings million 
the effective tax rate for increased to from in compared to during  operating expenses of  million were million higher than the  million incurred in the following table presents the costs per mcfe for the years ended december lease and well  including transportation dd a g a taxes other than income interest expense  net total per unit costs the higher per unit costs of lease and well  including transportation  dd a and taxes other than income for compared to were due primarily to the reasons set forth below 
lease and well expenses  including transportation  of million were million higher than due primarily to a general increase in service costs related to increased operating activities  including an increase in the number of wells  in the united states million  canada million  and trinidad million  increased transportation related costs in the united states million  canada million and the united kingdom million  and changes in the canadian exchange rate million 
dd a expenses of million increased million from due primarily to increased production in canada million  the united states million  and trinidad million  the commencement of production in the united kingdom million  increased dd a rates in the united states due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties million  increased dd a rates in canada mainly from developing acquired proved reserves million  and changes in the canadian exchange rate million 
g a expenses of million were million higher than due primarily to expanded operations 
taxes other than income of million were million higher than due primarily to a decrease in credits taken against severance taxes resulting from the qualification of additional wells for a texas high cost gas severance tax exemption million  an increase as a result of higher wellhead revenues in the united states million  trinidad million and canada million  higher property taxes as a result of higher property valuation in the united states million  the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of million  and an increase in the number of wells and facilities in canada million 
exploration costs of million were million higher than due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states million  canada million  the united kingdom million and trinidad million  and increased exploration administrative expenses across eog million 
impairments of million were million lower than due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the united states million  partially offset by higher amortization of unproved leases in canada million 
total impairments under sfas no 
were million in each of and net interest expense of million was million higher than due primarily to a slightly higher average debt balance 
other income expense  net for included income from equity investments of million  gains on sales of reserves and related assets of million and foreign currency transaction losses of million as a result of applying the changes in the canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany short term loans that eliminate in consolidation 
income tax provision increased million to million compared to  primarily resulting from higher income before income taxes million  offset by lower deferred income taxes associated with the alberta  canada corporate tax rate million and lower effective foreign income tax rates million 
the net effective tax rate for remained unchanged from the rate of 
in november  canada enacted legislation reducing the canadian federal income tax rate for companies in the resource sector from to for  with further reductions to phased in over the next four years 
this legislation also made changes to the tax treatment of crown royalties and the resource allowance 
beginning in  canadian taxpayers are allowed to deduct of actual provincial and other crown royalties 
this percentage increases each year through  at which time of crown royalties will be deductible 
the resource allowance  a statutory deduction calculated as of adjusted resource profits  will be phased out through  when the deduction will be completely eliminated 
capital resources and liquidity cash flow the primary sources of cash for eog during the three year period ended december  included funds generated from operations  funds from new borrowings  proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan  proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties and proceeds from sales of partial interests in certain equity investments in trinidad

the level of exploration and development expenditures  including acquisitions  will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant 
there are no material continuing commitments associated with current expenditure plans

the estimated fair value of eog s debt at december  and was  million and  million  respectively 
the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and  where such prices were not available  upon interest rates currently available to eog at year end 
eog s debt is primarily at fixed interest rates 
at december   a decline in interest rates would result in a million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
during and  eog utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations 
while eog maintains a million commercial paper program  the maximum outstanding at any time during was million  and the amount outstanding at year end was zero 
eog considers this excess availability  which is backed by the million revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note to consolidated financial statements  combined with approximately million of availability under its shelf registration described below  to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 
in  the short term commercial paper loan balance was reduced by million  the million  notes due and the remaining million outstanding under the senior unsecured term loan facility were repaid primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
on february   a foreign subsidiary of eog repaid million of the million it borrowed in see note to consolidated financial statements 
during  based on resources available at december   eog plans to pay off the million  notes due contractual obligations the following table summarizes eog s contractual obligations at december  in thousands contractual obligations total beyond current and long term debt non cancelable operating leases interest payments on current and long term debt pipeline transportation service commitments drilling rig commitments seismic purchase obligations other purchase obligations total contractual obligations this table does not include the liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties

 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january   eog recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  this table does not include eog s pension or postretirement benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december  management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 
shelf registration as of february   the amount available under various filed registration statements with the securities and exchange commission for the offer and sale from time to time of eog debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock totaled approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
such entities  often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe  are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries  including canada  trinidad and the united kingdom 
the foreign currency most significant to eog s operations during was the canadian dollar 
the continued strengthening of the canadian dollar in impacted both the revenues and expenses of eog s canadian subsidiaries 
however  since the canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united states prices  the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses 
eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
effective march   eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note to consolidated financial statements 
eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
 and under those provisions  as of december   eog recorded the fair value of the swap of million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of million for the year ended december  this amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
outlook natural gas prices historically have been volatile  and this volatility is expected to continue 
uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends  and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry 
in eog s opinion  overall natural gas production in the united states is declining 
in addition  the increasing recognition of natural gas as a more environmentally friendly source of energy is likely to result in increases in demand 
being primarily a natural gas producer  eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices 
longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels  such as oil and coal 
assuming a totally unhedged position for  based on eog s tax position and the portion of eog s anticipated natural gas volumes for for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts  eog s price sensitivity for each per mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
eog is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil price 
eog s price sensitivity in for each per barrel change in average wellhead crude oil prices is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
for information regarding eog s natural gas hedge position as of december   see note to consolidated financial statements 
marketing companies have played an important role in the united states and canada natural gas market 
these companies aggregate natural gas supplies through purchases from producers like eog and then resell the gas to end users  local distribution companies or other buyers 
in recent years  several of the largest natural gas marketing companies have filed for bankruptcy or are having financial difficulty  and others are exiting this business 
eog does not believe that this will have a material effect on its ability to market its natural gas production 
eog continues to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of partners to whom it sells its production and where appropriate  to seek new markets 
eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada 
however  in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in trinidad and the united kingdom north sea  eog anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the united states and canada 
in addition  eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in other exploitation type opportunities 
budgeted exploration and development expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are approximately billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eog s strategy of funding the united states and canada exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition activities primarily from available intern ally generated cash flow 
the level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
based upon existing economic and market conditions  eog believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year 
however  eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant 
while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states  canada  trinidad and the united kingdom  such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to protection of the environment  affect eog s operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration  development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances  including crude oil  into the environment 
in addition  eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eog s control 
under environmental laws and regulations  eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators 
in addition  eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the op erator 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases eog s overall cost of business  but has not had a material adverse effect on eog s operations or financial condition 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning  and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on  among other things  their impact on the portrayal of eog s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and the degree of difficulty  subjectivity and complexity in their deployment 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
management routinely discusses the development  selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies 
following is a discussion of eog s most critical accounting policies proved oil and gas reserves eog s engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic cond itions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
oil and gas exploration costs oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production  a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability o f the project is being made 
all other exploratory wells that do not meet these criteria are expensed after one year 
as of december  and  eog had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note to consolidated financial statements 
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil  are capitalized 
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis  and any impairment in value is recognized 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive  based on historical experience  is amortized over the average holding period 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on eog s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis 
assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions  and impairments

r is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after june  eog adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
eog expects this will reduce net earnings by a pre tax amount of approximately million  taking into consideration the estimated forfeitures and cancellations 
this amount includes approximately million of expense for unvested options outstanding at december  and approximately million of expense for the employee stock purchase plan 
sfas no 
r also requires a public entity to present its cash flows provided by tax benefits from stock options exercised in the financing cash flows section of the statement of cash flows
