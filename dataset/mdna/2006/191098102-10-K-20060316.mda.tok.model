consolidated the company produces  markets and distributes nonalcoholic beverages  primarily products of the coca cola company  which include some of the most recognized and popular beverage brands in the world 
the company is the second largest bottler of products of the coca cola company in the united states  operating in eleven states primarily in the southeast 
the company also distributes several other beverage brands 
the company s product offerings include carbonated soft drinks  bottled water  teas  juices  isotonics and energy drinks 
the company had net sales of approximately billion in the nonalcoholic beverage market is highly competitive 
the company s competitors in these markets include bottlers and distributors of nationally advertised and marketed products  regionally advertised and marketed products and private label soft drinks 
in each region in which the company operates  between and of carbonated soft drink sales in bottles  cans and other containers are accounted for by the company 
table of contents and its principal competitors  which in each region includes the local bottler of pepsi cola and  in some regions  the local bottler of dr pepper  royal crown and or up products 
during the last three years  volume of sugar carbonated soft drinks in the soft drink industry has declined 
the decline in sugar carbonated beverages has generally been offset by volume growth in other nonalcoholic product categories 
the company s bottle can sales volume by product category as a percentage of total bottle can sales volume was as follows fiscal year product category sugar carbonated soft drinks diet carbonated soft drinks total carbonated soft drinks bottled water isotonics other noncarbonated total noncarbonated total areas of emphasis key priorities for the company during and over the next several years include revenue management  product innovation  distribution cost management and overall productivity 
revenue management revenue management includes striking the appropriate balance between generating growth in volume  gross margin and market share 
it requires a strategy which reflects consideration for pricing of brands and packages within channels  as well as highly effective working relationships with customers and disciplined fact based decision making 
revenue management has been and continues to be a key driver which has significant impact on the company s operating income performance 
product innovation volume growth of carbonated soft drinks has slowed over the past several years 
innovation of both new brands and packages has been and will continue to be critical to the company s overall volume 
during the first quarter of  the company introduced coca cola with lime and full throttle  an energy product from the coca cola company 
during the second quarter of  the company introduced coca cola zero  dasani flavors  and vault in certain markets 
the company introduced vault in the company s remaining markets in the fourth quarter of the company introduced diet coke with lime  coca cola c and rockstar  an energy drink  in in addition  the company has also developed specialty packaging for customers in certain channels over the past several years 
distribution cost management distribution cost represents the cost of transporting finished goods from company locations to customer outlets 
total distribution costs amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
over the past several years  the company has focused on converting its distribution system from a conventional routing system to a predictive system 
this conversion to a predictive system has allowed 
table of contents the company to more efficiently handle increasing numbers of brands and packages 
in addition  the company has closed a number of smaller sales distribution centers reducing its fixed warehouse related costs 
the company has three primary delivery systems for its current business bulk delivery for large supermarkets  mass merchandisers and club stores  pre sell delivery for convenience stores  drug stores  small supermarkets and on premise accounts  and full service delivery for its full service vending customers 
in  the company will begin changing its delivery method for its pre sell delivery system 
historically  the company loaded its trucks at the warehouse with products the route delivery employee would deliver during the day 
the delivery employee was responsible for pulling the required products off a side load truck at each stop to fill the customer s order 
the company will begin using a new pre sell delivery method in which involves pre building orders in the warehouse on a small pallet that the delivery employee can roll off a truck directly into the customer s location 
this new method involves the use of a rear loading truck rather than the conventional side loading truck 
in the initial rollout of this new method  the company anticipates delivery efficiency will increase by approximately for its pre sell delivery routes 
the company plans to implement this new delivery method in approximately distribution centers during these distribution centers accounted for approximately of the company s total bottle can sales volume in this rollout will require additional capital spending for the new type of delivery vehicle 
capital spending is anticipated to increase significantly in as compared to as discussed more fully below 
the company anticipates that this change in delivery methodology will result in significant savings in future years  more efficient delivery of a larger number of products  improved employee safety and a reduction in the number of workers compensation claims 
distribution cost management will continue to be a key area of emphasis for the company for the next several years 
productivity to achieve improvements in operating performance over the long term  the company s gross margin must grow faster than the growth in selling  delivery and administrative s  d a expenses 
a key driver in the company s s  d a expense management relates to ongoing improvements in labor productivity and asset productivity 
the company continues to focus on its supply chain and distribution functions for opportunities to improve productivity 

table of contents overview of operations and financial condition the following overview provides a summary of key information concerning the company s financial results for the three years ended fiscal year in thousands except per share data net sales gross margin income from operations interest expense income taxes net income basic net income per share results for included a favorable adjustment of million pre tax related to the settlement of high fructose corn syrup litigation  which was reflected as a reduction in cost of sales

results for included a favorable adjustment of approximately million pre tax for certain customer related marketing programs between the company and the coca cola company  which was reflected as a reduction in cost of sales 
results for included net favorable adjustments to income tax expense of million relating to the favorable settlement of a state income tax audit and the reduction of its valuation allowance for certain deferred income tax assets  offset partially by incremental tax expense associated with the decision to terminate certain company owned life insurance policies 
the company does not currently have any stock options or other common stock equivalents that would result in dilution of earnings per share 
accordingly  for the periods presented  basic and fully diluted earnings per share are equivalent 
the company s net sales grew approximately from to the net sales increase was primarily due to an increase in average revenue per unit of approximately  a increase in bottle can sales volume  and a increase in sales to other coca cola bottlers primarily related to shipments of full throttle  the new energy drink of the coca cola company 
the company has seen declines in the demand for sugar carbonated soft drinks over the past three years and expects that this trend will continue 
the company anticipates that overall bottle can sales volume will be primarily dependent upon continued growth in diet products  isotonics  bottled water and energy drinks as well as the introduction of new products 
gross margin increased approximately in compared to the company s gross margin percentage declined from in to in due to higher raw material costs and an increase in sales to other coca cola bottlers  which have lower margins than the company s bottle can franchise sales 
sales to other coca cola bottlers accounted for of the decrease in gross margin percentage 
the company s raw material packaging costs increased significantly in the company increased selling prices to partially offset these increased costs 
income from operations increased approximately in compared to the increase was due to solid growth in gross margin and lower depreciation expense  which more than offset higher s  d a expenses 

table of contents s  d a expenses have increased approximately from to the increase in s  d a expenses was primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation of approximately  employee benefit plan costs of approximately  property and casualty insurance costs of approximately and fuel costs of approximately 
depreciation expense decreased approximately from to the decrease in depreciation expense from to was primarily due to lower levels of capital spending over the past several years

discussion of critical accounting policies  estimates and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has not made changes in any critical accounting policies during any significant changes in critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company during the quarter in which a change is contemplated and prior to making such change 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on the company s recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding 

table of contents the company s review of potential bad debts considers the specific industry in which a particular customer operates  such as supermarket retailers  convenience stores and mass merchandise retailers  and the general economic conditions that currently exist in that specific industry 
the company then considers the effects of concentration of credit risk in a specific industry and for specific customers within that industry 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
factors such as changes in the planned use of manufacturing equipment  vending equipment  transportation equipment  warehouse facilities or software could also result in shortened useful lives 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
the company evaluates long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset s carrying amount  the asset is written down to its fair value and the company recognizes an impairment loss 
franchise rights the company considers franchise rights with the coca cola company and other beverage companies to be indefinite lived because the agreements are perpetual or  in situations where agreements are not perpetual  the company anticipates the agreements will continue to be renewed upon expiration 
the cost of renewals is minimal and the company has not had any renewals denied 
the company considers franchise rights as indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
and therefore  does not amortize the value of such assets 
instead  franchise rights are tested at least annually for impairment 
impairment testing of franchise rights and goodwill the only intangible assets the company classifies as indefinite lived are franchise rights and goodwill 
sfas no 
requires testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the company conducts its annual impairment test in the third quarter of each fiscal year 
the company also reviews intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment if there are significant changes in business conditions 
for the annual impairment analysis of franchise rights  the fair value for the company s acquired franchise rights is estimated using a multi period excess earnings approach 
this approach involves projecting future earnings  discounting those estimated earnings using an appropriate discount rate and subtracting a contributory charge for net working capital  property  plant and equipment  assembled workforce and customer relationships to arrive at excess earnings attributable to franchise rights 
the present value of the excess earnings attributable to franchise rights is their estimated fair value and is compared to the carrying value on an aggregate basis 
based on this analysis  there was no impairment of the company s recorded franchise rights in the projection of earnings includes a number of assumptions such as projected net sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes 
changes in the assumptions required to estimate the present value of the excess earnings attributable to franchise rights could materially impact the fair value estimate 

table of contents for the annual impairment analysis of goodwill  the company develops an estimated fair value for the enterprise using an average of three different approaches market value  using the company s stock price plus outstanding debt and minority interest  discounted cash flow analysis  and multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization based upon relevant industry data 
the estimated fair value of the enterprise is then compared to the company s carrying amount including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the company exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill will be considered not to be impaired and the second step of the sfas no 
impairment test will not be necessary 
if the carrying amount including goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
based on this analysis  there was no impairment of the company s recorded goodwill in the discounted cash flow analysis includes a number of assumptions such as projected sales volume  net sales  cost of sales and operating expenses 
changes in these assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimate of the enterprise 
income tax estimates the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
a reduction in the valuation allowance and corresponding adjustment to income may be required if the likelihood of realizing existing deferred tax assets were to increase to a more likely than not level 
the company regularly reviews the realizability of deferred tax assets and initiates a review when significant changes in the company s business occur 
in addition to a valuation allowance related to state net operating loss carryforwards  the company records liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of january  principally related to state income taxes and certain federal income tax attributes 
these liabilities reflect the company s best estimate of the ultimate income tax liability based on currently known facts and information 
material changes in facts or information as well as the expiration of statutes and or settlements with the individual state or federal jurisdictions could result in material adjustments to these estimates in the future 
risk management programs in general  the company is self insured for the costs of workers compensation  employment practices  vehicle accident claims and medical claims 
the company uses commercial insurance for claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses 
losses are provided for using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry  adjusted for company specific history and expectations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all full time nonunion employees and certain union employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  employee turnover  age at retirement and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as mortality rates to estimate the projected 
table of contents benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost recorded by the company in future periods 
in  the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans decreased to from in due to declining interest rates for long term corporate bonds  which serve as the benchmark for determining the discount rate 
the discount rate assumption is generally the estimate which can have the most significant impact on net periodic pension cost and the projected benefit obligation for these pension plans 
the company determines an appropriate discount rate annually based on the annual yield on long term corporate bonds as of the measurement date 
a 
increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption would have impacted the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost as follows in thousands 
increase 
decrease impact on projected benefit obligation at january  net periodic pension cost in the weighted average expected long term rate of return of plan assets was for  and this rate reflects an estimate of long term future returns for the pension plan assets 
this estimate is primarily a function of the asset classes equities versus fixed income in which the pension plan assets are invested and the analysis of past performance of these asset classes over a long period of time 
this analysis includes expected long term inflation and the risk premiums associated with equity and fixed income investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the details by asset type of the company s pension plan assets at january  and january   and the weighted average expected long term rate of return of each asset type 
the actual return of pension plan assets was and for and  respectively 
on february   the board of directors of the company approved an amendment to the principal company sponsored pension plan to cease further benefit accruals under the plan effective june  the company anticipates that the annual expense for the pension plans will decrease approximately million in the company sponsors a postretirement health care plan for employees meeting specified qualifying criteria 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and postretirement benefit obligation for this plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate and the expected growth rate for the cost of health care benefits 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected liability under this plan 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
the company does not pre fund its postretirement benefits and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these benefits in the future 
in october  the company announced changes to its postretirement health care plan 
due to the changes announced  the company s expense and liability related to its postretirement health care plan will be reduced 
both the expense and liability for postretirement health care benefits are subject to determination by the company s actuaries and include numerous variables that will affect the impact of the announced changes 
the company anticipates that the annual expense for the postretirement health care plan will decrease from million in to approximately million in the annual expense for the postretirement health care plan will decrease approximately million in 
table of contents the discount rate assumption  the annual health care cost trend and the ultimate trend rate for health care costs are key estimates which can have a significant impact on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost and postretirement obligation in future periods 
the company annually determines the health care cost trend based on recent actual medical trend experience and projected experience for the following years 
the discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on yield rates available on double a bonds as of each plan s measurement date 
the discount rates for were derived using the citigroup pension discount curve which is a set of yields on hypothetical double a zero coupon bonds with maturities up to years 
projected benefit payouts from each plan are matched to the citigroup pension discount curve and an equivalent flat discount rate is derived and then rounded to the nearest quarter percent

table of contents net sales net sales increased by approximately in compared to the net sales increase in was primarily due to an increase in average revenue per case of approximately  an increase in bottle can sales volume of approximately and an increase in sales to other coca cola bottlers of more than 
in  the company s bottle can sales accounted for of the company s net sales 
bottle can net pricing is based on the invoice price charged to customers reduced by promotional allowances 
bottle can net pricing per case is impacted by the price charged per package  the volume generated in each package and the channels in which those packages are sold 
to the extent the company is able to increase volume in higher margin packages that are sold through higher margin channels  bottle can net pricing per case can increase without an actual increase in wholesale pricing 
in  the increase in the company s bottle can net price per case was primarily achieved with price increases  but also reflects additional mix benefit associated with new products  including energy drinks  vault  dasani flavors and coca cola zero 
the company s net sales to other coca cola bottlers and post mix net sales increased to million and million in compared to million and million in  respectively 
the significant increase in sales to other coca cola bottlers resulted from volume related primarily to shipments of full throttle  the new energy product of the coca cola company 
the company produced this product for the majority of the coca cola bottlers in the eastern half of the united states in and anticipates continuing to produce this product for these customers in the percentage increases in bottle can sales volume by product category in compared to the comparable period in were as follows product category bottle can sales volume increase sugar carbonated soft drinks diet carbonated soft drinks total carbonated soft drinks bottled water isotonics other noncarbonated beverages including energy drinks total noncarbonated beverages total bottle can sales volume the company s noncarbonated beverage portfolio continues to provide strong volume growth with dasani growing at and powerade growing at in the newly introduced energy drinks  full throttle and rockstar  accounted for

cost of sales cost of sales on a per unit basis for bottle can sales volume increased approximately in compared to primarily due to higher raw material costs 
the increase in cost of sales was mitigated by the million settlement of litigation regarding purchases of high fructose corn syrup 
during the second quarter of  the coca cola company changed its method of concentrate pricing  resulting in a change in the company s investment in inventories and an increase in cost of sales of million 
cost of sales for included a favorable item of approximately million  primarily for certain customer related marketing programs between the company and the coca cola company  which were recorded in the first quarter of as marketing funding support and were reflected as a reduction of cost of sales 
packaging costs per unit increased by approximately during as compared to the increase in packaging costs in related to significantly higher plastic bottle costs resulting from cost increases in the underlying components and increased aluminum can costs  and was the primary cause of the increase in cost of sales on a per unit basis in at the beginning of  the company reclassified plastic shells  premix tanks and co tanks  which totaled million  from property  plant and equipment to inventories 
these items were reclassified as the company believes that they are more closely related to the sale of finished product inventories than to a component of property  plant and equipment 
this reclassification had no significant impact on the company s overall financial position or results of operations 
costs associated with these items have been reflected in cost of sales beginning in previously  costs associated with these items were recorded as depreciation expense 
the company relies extensively on advertising and sales promotion in the marketing of its products 
the coca cola company and other beverage companies that supply concentrates  syrups and finished products to the company make substantial marketing and advertising expenditures to promote sales in the local territories served by the company 
the company also benefits from national advertising programs conducted by the coca cola company and other beverage companies 
certain of the marketing expenditures by the coca cola company and other beverage companies are made pursuant to annual arrangements 
although the coca cola company has advised the company that it intends to continue to provide marketing funding support  it is not obligated to do so under the company s bottle contracts 
significant decreases in marketing funding support from the coca cola company or other beverage companies could adversely impact operating results of the company in the future 
total marketing funding support from the coca cola company and other beverage companies  which includes direct payments to the company and payments to customers for marketing programs  was million for versus million for and was recorded as a reduction in cost of sales 
since may   the coca cola company has provided the majority of the company s marketing funding support for bottle can products through a reduction in the price of concentrate

these measures exclude the impact of high fructose corn syrup litigation proceeds in and a change in concentrate pricing and an adjustment of customer marketing programs reimbursements in the decrease in adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales from to resulted primarily from the impact of higher sales to other coca cola bottlers  which have lower margins of the decrease 
the remainder of the decrease resulted primarily from increases in the company s packaging costs which were not offset by higher average net pricing 
the company s gross margins as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to other companies  since some entities include all costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales and the company excludes a portion of these costs from gross margin  including them instead in s  d a expenses 
s  d a expenses s  d a expenses increased by approximately in compared to the increase in s  d a expenses was primarily due to wage increases for the company s employees of approximately million  higher employee benefits costs including pension and health care costs of approximately million and higher fuel costs of approximately million 
the company continues to incur increased fuel costs 
over the last three years  the company has converted the majority of its distribution system from a conventional sales method to a predictive selling method in which sales personnel either visit or call a customer to determine the customer s requirements for their order 
this predictive selling method has enabled the company to add a significant number of new products and packages and provides the capacity to add additional product offerings in the future 
the company will continue to evaluate its distribution system in an effort to improve the process of distributing products to customers 
the company is in the process of changing its delivery method for certain customers as described more fully above under areas of emphasis  distribution cost management
