through on line connectivity  applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions 
in we improved our cost structure related to freight  shipping and logistical services by opening new global distribution centers in the philippines and shanghai  china and improved domestic shipping and customs clearance operations  and as a result we achieved approximately million of cost savings related to our freight and logistical support operations compared to we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 
patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor and our on logo 
we own rights to a number of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business 
in connection with our recapitalization  motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed  as the case may be  to us certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business 
as of january  we had approximately us and foreign patents and approximately patent applications pending worldwide 
our patents have expiration dates ranging from to none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business 
additionally  we have rights to more than registered and common law trademarks 
our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 
as part of the recapitalization  motorola assigned to us approximately us patents and patent applications  approximately foreign patents and patent applications  rights to over trademarks not including the motorola name previously used in connection with our products  rights in know how relating to at least semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials 
in addition  motorola licensed on a nonexclusive  royalty free basis other patent  trademark  copyright and know how rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our long range plans 
we have perpetual  royalty free  worldwide rights under motorola s patent portfolio and other intellectual property  existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the five year period existing only with respect to patents  as necessary to manufacture  market and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines 
additionally  motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization  which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program 
we believe that we have the right to use all motorola owned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 
seasonality historically  our revenues have been affected by the seasonal trends of the semiconductor and related industries 
as a result of these trends  we have typically experienced sales increases in the first two quarters of the year and relatively flat sales levels in the third and fourth quarters 
however  beginning in  various events have disrupted this pattern 
in  revenues declined due to slowing demand in the semiconductor market and the general economic decline 
in and  revenues fluctuated within a narrow range and in revenues increased in the first and second quarter  but declined in the last two quarters 
in  revenues were relatively flat in the first and second quarter and increased in the last two quarters 
at this time  it is unclear when the semiconductor industry is going to return to the seasonal trends that existed prior to backlog our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are booked as far as weeks in advance of delivery 
generally  prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking 
backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers  in each case scheduled to be shipped over the week period following such date 
backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to 
table of contents product lead times 
because we record revenues on a sell through basis  backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered 
during  our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between and of actual revenues during such quarter 
as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases  customers tend to order products further in advance and  as a result  backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 
in the semiconductor industry  backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs 
agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or  as a matter of industry practice  are often not enforced 
therefore  a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable 
for these reasons  the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 
we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just in time principles while shortening the cycle times required to produce ordered products 
however  these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 
competition the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for general purpose semiconductor products like ours  is highly competitive 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies  as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
see risk factors trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs elsewhere in this report

government regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances  the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites  and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

table of contents our manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona is located on property that is a superfund site  a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to clean up activities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of on site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona 
as part of our recapitalization  motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 
manufacturing facilities in slovakia and the czech republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by government owned entities 
in each case  these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on site and off site with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations 
the governments of the czech republic and slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries  subject to specified limitations  for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination 
based upon the information available  we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 
our manufacturing facility in east greenwich  rhode island has adjoining property that has localized soil contamination 
in connection with the purchase of the facility  we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island 
this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property 
based on the information available  we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 
we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and liability for currently known environmental conditions  to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
it is possible  however  that future developments  including changes in laws and regulations  government policies  customer specification  personnel and physical property conditions  including currently undiscovered contamination  could lead to material costs

table of contents trends  risks and uncertainties related to our business we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be  subject to substantial fluctuations 
our revenues for were  million  compared to  million for and  million for we reported net income of million in and incurred net losses of million in and million in reduced end user demand  price declines  excess inventory  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business  and we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses in the future 
in order to remain profitable  we must continue to successfully implement our business plan  including our cost reduction initiatives 
however  we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our recent profitability 
we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future 
the most recent downturn  which began in the fourth quarter of  was severe and prolonged  and it is uncertain whether recent improvements in semiconductor industry performance will continue or whether such improvements will benefit us to the same extent as they benefit other industry participants 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry may also be severe and prolonged 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to fully recover from its recent downturn  could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the s and continuing into  the semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth  benefiting from the rapid expansion of the internet and other computing and communications technologies 
during  we like many of our customers and competitors were adversely affected by a general economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end user products that incorporate our integrated circuits and standard semiconductors 
the terrorist attacks of september  also further depressed economic activity and demand for end user products 
the impact of slowing end customer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of equipment and component inventories among our original equipment manufacturer  subcontractor and distributor customers  resulting in increasing pricing pressure 
we expect that factors including  but not limited to  economic uncertainty and downturns relating to the threat or actual occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  reduced demand for end user products  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and changes in our revenue mix could adversely impact our operating results in the near term 
our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit was for  compared to for and for gross profit improved in and  in each case as a result of increased sales volume and cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs 
increased competition and other factors may lead to further price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

table of contents the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of  our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
between and the end of  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in response to the significant downturn in our industry 
these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions  transitioning higher cost external supply to internal manufacturing  working with our material suppliers to further lower costs  personnel reductions  reductions in employee compensation  temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead 
however  we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will  in and of themselves  help us sustain our profitability 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in  million in and million in to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives 
these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments 
the impact of these restructuring actions on our ability to compete effectively is subject to risks and uncertainties 
because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes  without limitation  plans to continue to aggresively manage  maintain and refine our product portfolio  continue to develop leading edge customer support services  expand further our just in time delivery capabilities  increase our die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner  reduce further the number of our product platforms and process flows  rationalize our manufacturing operations  relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions  reduce selling and administrative expenses  manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands  actively manage working capital  develop new products in a more efficient manner  and focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
in particular  we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential  increase our volume or revenue  rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 
our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably 
each of these factors depends on our ability  among other things  to finance our operating and product development activities  maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations  relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations  access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a cost effective and timely manner  protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy  such as risks associated with international operations  the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities  increased competition  legal developments and general economic conditions  are beyond our control 
in addition  circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 
we may require additional capital in the future  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations and sales of assets in the ordinary course of business  will be sufficient to meet our planned 
table of contents capital needs for the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future activities or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
as of february   we had million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
subject to the restrictions contained in our senior bank facilities  we may be able to raise these funds by selling securities to the public or selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly  reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development  make selective dispositions of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets  or otherwise impair our ability to remain competitive 
we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we routinely purchase inventory based on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 
during various periods in  and  short customer lead times prevailed given the overcapacity in the industry 
these and other factors adversely affected our revenues during these periods 
an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us  and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries that are currently the primary end users of semiconductors 
as these industries evolve and introduce new products  our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by designing  developing  manufacturing  marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and end users and adapt to such changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end users could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

table of contents competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for semiconductor components  is highly competitive 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 
many of our competitors may have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products  longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets  patent protection and greater name recognition 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price  quality  technical performance  product features  product system compatibility  customized design  strategic relationships with customers  new product innovation  availability  delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 
gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used  such as personal computers  industrial and telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive  the failure  inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 
our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in we may be required to increase our future capital expenditures to meet increased demand 

table of contents semiconductor manufacturing has historically required  and in the future is likely to continue to require  a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 
we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency 
any such implementation  however  can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation  any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or  in some instances  to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned 
in the case of abandonment  we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing or information technology and equipment 
in addition  our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures 
if we were to lose one of our large customers or if the existing downturn in the automotive market persists or deepens  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
product sales to our ten largest customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries  and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered 
generally  our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products 
we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
in  approximately of our total revenues were attributable to our various automotive customers 
certain of these automotive customers have been experiencing a downturn in their business  in part due to labor difficulties 
on october   delphi corporation  one of our automotive customers  and certain of its us subsidiaries commenced reorganization proceedings under chapter of the us federal bankruptcy code 
in  our sales to delphi accounted for less than of our total annual revenues and approximately million of our receivables due from delphi are subject to collection pending resolution of the reorganization proceedings 
there can be no assurance that other automotive customers will not also enter into reorganization proceedings or declare bankruptcy 
we may have to change our revenue recognition practices from an accrual basis to a cash basis for these customers if the collection of accounts receivable from them is not reasonably assured  which would have an adverse impact on our profitability 
the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services  or increases in the prices of such goods or services  could adversely affect our operations and productivity 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates 
our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials  including silicon wafers  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
generally  our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations  and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just in time basis 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

table of contents in addition  for some of our products  such as our silicon germanium sige technology  we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials 
the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods 
these contract manufacturers  including ait  ase  kec  magnachip  phenitec and psi  accounted for approximately  and of our manufacturing costs in  and  respectively 
our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts  and in some cases require longer term commitments in the early stages of the relationship 
our operations could be adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated  the cost of such services increased significantly  the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 
acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or dilute our stockholders 
we may in the future acquire and form strategic alliances relating to other businesses  products and technologies 
successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require  among other things  efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business  and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in addition  we may issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances  which could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances  which could harm our operating results 
without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 
approximately  and of our revenues in  approximately  and of our revenues in and approximately  and of our revenues in were derived from the americas  the asia pacific region and europe including the middle east  respectively 
we maintain significant operations in seremban  malaysia  carmona  the philippines  aizu  japan  leshan  china  roznov  the czech republic  and piestany  the slovak republic 
in addition  we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia pacific region 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets 
risks inherent in doing business on an international level include  among others  the following economic and political instability including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  
table of contents power supply shortages and shutdowns  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other labor problems  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  and other risks relating to the administration of or changes in  or new interpretations of  the laws  regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 
if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
for example  analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain  and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components 
we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting 
at times  our stock price has declined substantially  reducing the effectiveness of these incentives 
loss of the services of  or failure to effectively recruit  qualified personnel  including senior managers and design engineers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
technology companies like ours have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  allowed companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb and accordingly  we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
under sfas no 
r  companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
the guidance provides that employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares are included within the term share based compensation arrangements 
public companies will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  the cumulative effect of initially applying sfas no 
r  if any  is recognized as of the required effective date 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method as defined by sfas no 
r and accordingly will begin recognizing compensation expense in the first quarter of in light of our anticipated adoption of fas r  we and our compensation committee are re evaluating our current incentive compensation strategies 
based on this re evaluation  we may make changes to our policies and procedures regarding equity based 
table of contents compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal will have an adverse impact on our results of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our share based compensation arrangements rather than disclosing the impact on results of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
this could negatively impact our future common stock price 
in addition  this could impact our ability to utilize broad based employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 
we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties  and litigation could arise in the future 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that any of the substantial number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business  including those that motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization  will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  the license rights granted by motorola in connection with our recapitalization will provide competitive advantages to us  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  any of the trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  know how or mask works that motorola has assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  or any of our pending or future trademark  copyright  or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 
also  we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
litigation could cause us to incur significant expense  by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  discontinue the use of processes  or obtain licenses to the infringing technologies 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms 
any such development  acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 
we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 
we are party to securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
in july  three stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us  certain of our former officers  current and former directors and various investment banking firms who acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public offering in may in april  the plaintiffs filed a consolidated  amended complaint that supercedes the individual complaints originally filed 
the amended complaint generally alleges that our offering documents failed to disclose certain underwriting fees and commissions and underwriter tie ins and other arrangements with certain customers of the underwriters that impacted the price of our common stock in the after market 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages 
on july   together with other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit 
on february   the court dismissed claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws with prejudice 
however  the court denied the motion to dismiss claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws 
in addition  the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of claims brought against the current and former directors and officers who were named as individual defendants in the litigation 
in june  upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon obtaining approval by the court 
on september   the court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement  directed that notice of the terms of the proposed settlement be provided to class members and scheduled a fairness hearing  at which objections to the proposed settlement will be heard 
thereafter  the court will determine whether to grant final approval to the proposed settlement 
if this proposed settlement is ultimately approved by the court  it would result in a dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this securities litigation 
any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the cost to us of defending the litigation  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
because the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the semiconductor industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit 
we are involved in a variety of routine legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these matters typically fall into the following broad categories those involving suppliers and customers  employment and labor  and intellectual property 
we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we are spending a significant amount of management time and external resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under section of the sarbanes oxley act of which requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm 
we have completed this section process for  and in doing so we were required to hire additional personnel and use outside advisory services and as a result we incurred additional accounting and legal expenses 
we believe that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december   however  if in the future our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as specified by applicable sec rules and regulations and or other applicable standards  our ability to publish accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be jeopardized and our common stock price and our business could be affected in a material adverse manner 
we do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting and more broadly our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent and or detect all errors and all fraud 
nevertheless  our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives 
that being said  a control procedure  no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that objectives of the control procedure are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods has risks  and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
because of its inherent limitations  disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
further  these sorts of controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within a company have been detected 
see part ii  item a controls and procedures of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola s ownership  occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our recapitalization 
we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances 
however  we cannot assure you that such 
table of contents indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 
based on information currently available to us  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and any liability for currently known environmental conditions  will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
however  we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september   or threats or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
on september  the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope 
the threat or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the market in which we operate and our profitability 
the terrorist attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets and future or threatened terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could result in greater economic instability 
warranty claims  product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design  original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves  or a requirement that we participate in a product recall  would have adverse effects that could be material on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total long term indebtedness of  million including current maturities  but excluding unused commitments and interest expense of million for the year ended december  also  we may incur additional debt in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 

table of contents the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to you  including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations  some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our debt agreements contain  and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain  financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the semiconductor industry  and our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors who have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures 
we may incur more debt  which could exacerbate the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  but do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 
the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 
our debt agreements contain  and any future debt agreements may include  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make investments  loans or advances  make some acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  pay dividends  redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  pay dividends from semiconductor components industries  llc to on semiconductor corporation  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  enter into new lines of business  issue some types of preferred stock  and enter into transactions with our affiliates 

table of contents in addition  our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated ebitda as defined therein 
any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 
our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or  if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control  that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities 
further  if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt  the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling additional assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
as of february   we had million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
on january   we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than million 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all  or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large portion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from our customers  including cancellations and reschedulings  the timing of introduction of new products  the gain or loss of significant customers  including as a result of industry consolidation  seasonality in some of our target markets  changes in the mix of products we sell  
table of contents changes in demand by the end users of our customers products  market acceptance of our current and future products  variability of our customers product life cycles  changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold  such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in the prices of our products  which can be affected by the level of our customers and end users demand  technological change  product obsolescence  competition or other factors  cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third party manufacturers  including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements  our liquidity and access to capital  and our research and development activities and the funding thereof 
our stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments  new products or product enhancements  loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  and additions or departures of key personnel

item legal proceedings we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information currently available  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters  including the matters described in the next paragraphs  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation  should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
securities class action litigation during the period july  through july   we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers  current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering 
the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv  breuer v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv  and cohen v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv on april   the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed 
the amended complaint alleges  among other things  that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering 
the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement 
the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages 
we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately other publicly traded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city  which have all been transferred  along with the case against us  to a single federal district judge for purposes of coordinated case management 
we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended  and intend to continue to defend  the litigation vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain  however  and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

table of contents on july   together with the other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated  amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants 
the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them 
in addition  the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation  and they are no longer parties to the litigation 
on february   the court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants 
in that ruling the court granted in part and denied in part those motions 
as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws  the court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice  and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to re plead these claims 
as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws  which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded  the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well 
the court also denied the underwriter defendants motion to dismiss in all respects 
in june  upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
if ultimately approved by the court  this proposed settlement would result in the dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
the proposed settlement does not provide for the resolution of any claims against the underwriter defendants  and the litigation against those defendants is continuing 
the proposed settlement provides that the class members in the class action cases brought against the participating issuer defendants will be guaranteed a recovery of billion by the participating issuer defendants 
if recoveries totaling less than billion are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants  the class members will be entitled to recover the difference between billion and the aggregate amount of those recoveries from the participating issuer defendants 
if recoveries totaling billion or more are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants  however  the monetary obligations to the class members under the proposed settlement will be satisfied 
in addition  we and any other participating issuer defendants will be required to assign to the class members certain claims that we may have against the underwriters of our initial public offerings 
the proposed settlement contemplates that any amounts necessary to fund the settlement or settlement related expenses would come from participating issuers directors and officers liability insurance policy proceeds  as opposed to funds of the participating issuer defendants themselves 
a participating issuer defendant could be required to contribute to the costs of the settlement if that issuer s insurance coverage were insufficient to pay that issuer s allocable share of the settlement costs 
we expect that our insurance proceeds will be sufficient for these purposes and that we will not otherwise be required to contribute to the proposed settlement 
consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon obtaining approval by the court 
on september   the court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement  directed that notice of the terms of the proposed settlement be provided to class members  and scheduled a fairness hearing for april   at which objections to the proposed settlement will be heard 
thereafter  the court will determine whether to grant final approval to the proposed settlement 
if the proposed settlement described above is not consummated  we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously 
while we can make no promises or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings  we believe that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
ams matter on march   we entered into a settlement agreement with austriamicrosystems  ag ams regarding a pending lawsuit 
under the settlement agreement we paid ams million in cash upon the signing of the agreement 
we had previously reserved million as a reasonable loss estimate of the loss exposure for 
table of contents this matter 
the settlement agreement includes  among other things  a full and complete mutual release of any and all claims  except for any claims arising out of the arbitration described below 
it also provides that the pending litigation will be dismissed with prejudice and each party will bear its own costs and fees incurred in connection with the litigation 
this dismissal occurred shortly after the signing of the agreement 
the settlement agreement requires that we and ams enter into final  binding and non appealable arbitration limited to one unresolved issue associated with the pending litigation 
the arbitration is currently anticipated to be held during the second quarter of if the arbitrator rules in favor of ams  we will pay an additional million within fifteen days of the ruling by the arbitrator 
if the arbitrator rules in favor of us  ams will not be entitled to any additional amounts of money from us 
each party shall bear its own costs and fees incurred in connection with the arbitration  and the parties will each pay fifty percent of the costs and fees of the arbitrator 
the matter originated out of an action filed in october in arizona superior court by ams against us 
the complaint i alleged that we breached a foundry agreement entered into in under which ams was to provide services to us  and ii claimed tortious interference with contract 
the complaint sought approximately million in contract damages  plus interest  costs  attorneys fees and exemplary damages 
we plan to vigorously defend ourselves at the arbitration and believe that we will prevail at the proceeding  although there can be no assurances that this will in fact occur 
we believe that the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
other matters on september   we entered into a settlement agreement with one of our customers and one of that customer s customers  resolving a potential claim against us for costs incurred in remedying certain alleged failures of products purchased directly or indirectly from us 
the potential claim  which was estimated by our customer to aggregate approximately million 
under the settlement agreement we agreed to pay our customer s customer million in cash and each party agreed to bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the claim 
at the same time  we entered into separate agreements with our customer  in part as a result of the claim and in part in an effort to increase our business with the customer  pursuant to which we agreed to i provide certain rebates to the customer for products and services purchased from us by them for a period of five years beginning october   and ii rebate not less than million in cash regardless of actual purchases no later than september  the amounts were considered to be warranty claims resulting in a warranty expense of million during the year ended december  see part i  item government regulation of this report for information on certain environmental matters

fin no 
requires that certain variable interest entities be consolidated by the primary beneficiary  as that term is defined in fin no 
we determined that our investment in leshan phoenix semiconductor company limited meets the definition of a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary  therefore  our investment in leshan should be consolidated under fin no 
we had previously accounted for our investment in leshan using the equity method 
while consolidation of our investment in leshan did not impact our previously reported net income loss or stockholders equity deficit  financial information for periods beginning on or after january  that appears in this report on form k has been revised for comparative purposes as allowed by fin no

in and  the charge represents the write off of capitalized debt issuance costs and certain third party expenses in connection with the prepayment of a portion of our senior bank facilities 

table of contents effective january   we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors 
recognition of revenue and the related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product to the end user 
during the second quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit pension obligations 
historically  we amortized our net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining service lives of active plan participants  to the extent that such net gains or losses exceeded the greater of of the related projected benefit obligation or plan assets 
effective january   we no longer defer actuarial gains or losses and will recognize such gains and losses during the fourth quarter of each year  which is the period in which our annual pension plan actuarial valuations are prepared 
the impact of this change for periods prior to january  was a charge of million  both before and after income taxes

for further information regarding the events summarized herein  you should read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety 
industry overview worldwide semiconductor industry sales were billion in  an increase of from billion in we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by the world semiconductor trade statistics group to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components 
the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since year ended december  worldwide semiconductor industry sales percent change total addressable market sales percent change in billions in billions based on shipment information published by world semiconductor trade statistics wsts  an industry research firm 
wsts collects this information based on product shipments  which is different from our revenue recognition policy as described in critical accounting policies revenue recognition contained elsewhere in this report 
we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable  but we have not independently verified it 
wsts periodically revises its information 
we assume no obligation to update such information 
our total addressable market comprises the following specific wsts product categories a discrete products all discrete semiconductors other than sensors  rf and microwave power transistors modules  rf and microwave diodes  rf and microwave ss transistors  power fet modules  igbt modules and optoelectronics  b standard analog products amplifiers  voltage regulators and references  comparators  assp consumer  assp computer  assp automotive and assp industrial and others  and c standard logic products general purpose logic and mos general purpose logic only 
although we categorize our products as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components  wsts uses different product categories 
following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of  the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in and grew more robust in both and worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by in  in and in sales in our total addressable market grew by in and in  reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines 
sales in our total addressable market remained stable in  reflecting increases in volume that were offset by price declines 
the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately during through these are projections and may not be indicative of actual results 
business overview we classify our products broadly as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components 
we design  manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products 
our power management semiconductor components control  convert  protect and monitor the supply of power to the 
table of contents different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices 
our data management semiconductor components provide high performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems 
our standard semiconductor components serve as building block components within virtually all electronic devices 
these various products fall into the logic  analog and discrete categories used by wsts 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical 
during a down cycle  unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem  resulting in revenue declines 
in response to such declines  manufacturers have shut down production capacity 
when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen  production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again 
as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities  shortages have begun to occur  which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers  thus prompting further capacity expansion 
such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand  which has triggered another similar cycle 
during the first half of  we experienced an increase in the end market unit demand sufficient to offset price decreases 
we also enjoyed growth in bookings during the second quarter with the book to bill ratio above one for the first quarter since the second quarter of during the second half of we also experienced an increase in the end market unit demand sufficient to grow revenues despite price decreases 
we expect price declines during to be moderate and we will continue to monitor the supply and demand picture to determine if pricing could be held or increased 
cost savings and restructuring activities since the fourth quarter of  we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and  as a result  we expect to rank  as compared to our primary competitors  among the lowest in terms of cost structure 
our profitability enhancement program includes the phase out of our manufacturing operations in east greenwich  rhode island  which was announced in december  and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic  which was announced in november we began to realize savings from this program during the fourth quarter of  with the full benefit beginning by the end of the fourth quarter of despite delays of approximately two quarters due to increased demand  the closure of our operations in east greenwich was completed in the third quarter of with all manufacturing equipment decommissioned and removed 
during the fourth quarter of  we successfully completed the work related to the decommissioning of the manufacturing building  which is currently being marketed for sale 
we expect to incur marginal operating expenses in to maintain the building until the sale is completed 
overall  we expect the full cost savings from these activities will produce at least million to million of annual cost savings beginning in the first quarter of in the second quarter of  we evaluated our operations in the czech republic and determined certain overhead functions were no longer necessary as a result of our previously announced transfer of our back end manufacturing lines in roznov to malaysia and the philippines 
following the reduction of such overhead functions  we realized approximately million of actual cost savings in we expect the total estimated annualized cost savings from the profitability enhancement program  including the transfer of our back end manufacturing lines from roznov to malaysia  to reduce our cost of revenues due to reduced employee costs  reduced depreciation and other cost savings  by million to million  million to million and million to million  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a five year agreement with respect to the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure 
as part of the agreement  we sold certain system software modules  resulting in a loss on disposal of assets of million 
as a result of these actions  starting in the second 
table of contents quarter of  we began to realize approximately million of annualized cost savings that reduces our general and administrative expenses due to reduced depreciation expense 
in the second quarter of  we announced our plan to transfer wafer fabrication operations from our facility in malaysia to our facility in arizona by the end of  which will eliminate approximately jobs 
as a result of this action  we expect to realize costs savings of approximately million to million over the next five years  beginning in the third quarter of savings during are expected to be insignificant due to transition and other costs  however  savings during are expected to be approximately million 
although we have production at several locations  we have initiated process improvements and selective low cost capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity 
our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on consolidation of manufacturing sites to improve economies of scale  transfer of production to lower cost regions  increase in die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner by moving production from to wafers and increasing the number of die per square inch  reduction of the number of new product platforms and process flows  and focusing production on profitable product families 
new product innovation as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives  excluding the introduction of lead free products  we introduced new products in  new products in and new products in our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications 
it is our practice to regularly re evaluate our research and development spending  to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly 
we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position us for continued growth 
as a result  we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity analog  standard component  mos power and clock and data management products 
we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 
debt reduction and financing activities since our recapitalization  we have had relatively high levels of long term debt as compared to our principal competitors 
during and  we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions  which extended a portion of our debt maturities 
some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense 
in connection with these transactions  we amended our senior bank facilities to  among other things  make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 
in the second half of and continuing into  we began undertaking measures to reduce our long term debt and related interest costs 
we reduced both our total debt and interest expense as a result of our public offerings of common stock in september and february  a portion of the proceeds from which we applied to prepay and redeem a portion of our outstanding debt prior to scheduled maturity 
we also lowered our interest expense further as a result of the issuance of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our senior bank facilities  the proceeds from which were used to repay higher interest notes 

table of contents in the second half of we continued these measures to reduce our interest costs by issuing convertible senior subordinated notes and using the proceeds from the issuance  along with cash on hand  to repay our junior subordinated note  which carried a significantly higher interest rate than the convertible senior subordinated notes 
in november  our outstanding series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock beneficially owned by an affiliate of the texas pacific group tpg was converted into common stock  which eliminated the accrual of preferred stock dividends 
additionally  in december and also in january we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate on the senior bank facilities 
as a result of these debt prepayments and refinancings  we reduced our total long term debt balance including the current portion from  million as of december  to  million as of december  we also reduced our interest expense from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the details of each of these financing events are outlined in the following sections 
also  see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this report and note long term debt  note redeemable preferred stock and note common stock of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
outlook based upon booking trends  backlog levels and estimated turns levels  we anticipate that revenues will be approximately million in the first quarter of as compared to revenues of million in the first quarter of and revenues of million in the fourth quarter of backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of were up from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  and represented over percent of our anticipated first quarter revenues 
we expect average selling prices will be down approximately one percent in the first quarter of we also expect that cost reductions will offset the decline in average selling prices and that gross profit will be flat at approximately in the first quarter of beginning in the first quarter of  we are required to expense stock based compensation in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment 
we currently expect this expense to be approximately million in the first quarter of due to the volatility of the price of our common stock and the uncertainty of future option grants to employees  we are unable to estimate this expense for periods subsequent to the first quarter of on november   we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options outstanding under our stock plans 
the acceleration of vesting applied to all unvested options that had an exercise price per share of or higher  with the exception of options granted to directors  certain officers and employees with options granted under the french provisions in our stock incentive plan 
as a result of the acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately 
the weighted average exercise price of the affected options was per share 
in making the decision to accelerate these options  the board of directors believed it was in the best interest of the stockholders to reduce the future earnings impact resulting from the planned adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of  and the resulting impact that this may have on our market value 
this acceleration of these options that were outstanding on november  is expected to reduce future expenses on a pre tax basis by approximately million in for the first quarter of  we expect selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses at approximately of revenues and research and development expenses at approximately of revenues 
we anticipate that net interest expense will be approximately million for the first quarter of for the year ended december  we anticipate cash capital expenditures will be approximately million

revenues from our power management and standard analog product line declined from to and increased from to in  the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in revenues from the automotive electronics and wireless communications end markets  partially offset by an increase in revenues from the computing end market 
in  revenues increased as increases in demand for consumer electronics and portable wireless devices were slightly offset by further decreases in automotive electronic product revenue 
revenues from mos power devices decreased from to and increased from to the decrease from to can be primarily attributed to a decrease in revenue from the computing end market and to the discontinuance of select products sold into the automotive electronics end markets  partially offset by an increase in revenues from the wireless communications end markets 
the growth in revenue from to can be attributed to increased demand across all markets  with primary growth in revenue attributed to the ongoing introduction of new devices for specific end markets such as computing  portable and consumer electronics  as well as modest increases in the automotive electronics end market 
revenues from high frequency clock and data management products decreased from to and increased from to the decrease in can be attributed to decreased demand across all markets  which has been most pronounced in the industrial electronics and networking end markets 
the growth in this sector in was primarily driven by an increase in the industrial electronics end markets  which was attributable to increased revenue from automated test equipment  partially offset by decreases in the networking end market 
revenues from standard components increased steadily from to this product line consists of many products that are available from numerous competitors in the marketplace and is thus heavily influenced by pricing pressures and general market conditions 
the increase in revenue from to can be primarily attributed to an increase in revenues from the wireless communications end market  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the industrial electronics and consumer end markets 
the increase in revenue from to was attributed to increased demand across all markets  with significant increases in demand for end products used in wireless communications and handheld applications and consumer electronics

in the normal course of our business  we enter into various operating leases for equipment including our mainframe computer system  desktop computers  communications  foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 
our other long term contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our us and foreign pension plans 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the us pension plan  named the on semiconductor grandfathered pension plan grandfathered plan  has been terminated effective december  as approved by the pension benefit guaranty corporation in and such termination was determined by the internal revenue service not to adversely affect its qualification for federal tax purposes 
in connection with the termination of our grandfathered plan  all cash funding requirements 
table of contents for the liability have been settled and the related plan assets have been distributed as of december  the remaining obligation in the table above includes estimated funding requirements for liabilities related to our foreign pension plans 
our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december  we believe that our cash flows from operations  coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs over the next months 
our senior bank facilities include a million revolving facility 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december  we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than million 
contingencies we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements 
some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement  property damage including environmental contamination  personal injury  failure to comply with applicable laws  our negligence or willful misconduct  or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 
we are a party to various agreements with motorola  a former affiliate  which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola 
pursuant to these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to  for example  breach of representations and warranties and covenants  damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets  and for specified environmental matters 
our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract  which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola s claims 
we provide for indemnification of directors  officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements  certificates of incorporation  by laws  articles of association or similar organizational documents  as the case may be 
we maintain directors and officers insurance  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in addition to the above  from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification  other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see part i  item legal proceedings of this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i  item business government regulation of this report for information on certain environmental matters 

table of contents sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments  and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances 
in the near term  we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales 
additionally  as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows  including changes in demand for our products  competitive pricing pressures  effective management of our manufacturing capacity  our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses  the impact of our restructuring programs on our productivity and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business  and factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise  including interest rate fluctuations  our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants under our existing credit facilities and other limitations imposed by our credit facilities or arising from our substantial leverage 
our ability to service our long term debt  to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to  among other things  our future operating performance as well as to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may beyond our control 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or  if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december  to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

table of contents operations our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash  and our management of our assets and liabilities  including both working capital and long term assets and liabilities 
each of these components is discussed herein ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and cash flows 
while ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity  we believe this measure is useful to investors to assess our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth our ebitda for the years ended december   and  with a reconciliation to cash flows from operations  the most directly comparable financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles in millions december  december  december  net income loss increase decrease depreciation and amortization interest expense interest income income tax provision ebitda increase decrease interest expense interest income income tax provision loss gain on sale or disposal of fixed assets non cash portion of loss on debt prepayment amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount provision for excess inventories cumulative effect of accounting change non cash impairment write down of property  plant and equipment non cash impairment of other long lived assets non cash interest on junior subordinated note payable to motorola deferred income taxes stock compensation expense other changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities as a result of the improved operating performance we generated positive ebitda for  and ebitda for was million  primarily as a result of the restructuring  asset impairment and other  net charges in that were million higher than those in and a cumulative effect of accounting change of million in ebitda for declined to million primarily as a result of the charges associated with our previously described debt refinancings partially offset by improved operating performance 
ebitda for increased to million largely due to the generation of net income of million for the year 

table of contents as discussed in note long term debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  our debt covenants require us to maintain a trailing month minimum adjusted ebitda of million 
adjusted ebitda  as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately million for the months ended december  this adjusted ebitda computation excludes certain restructuring and other charges and contains other differences from the ebitda as defined above 
therefore  ebitda in the above table is not representative of the adjusted ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 
if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior secured credit agreement  including the adjusted ebitda maintenance covenant  the holders of our senior secured indebtedness could cause all outstanding amounts to be due and payable immediately 
if we were unable to repay  refinance or restructure that indebtedness  the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
working capital working capital fluctuates depending on end market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables  inventory and payables 
in times of escalating demand  our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production 
our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs  which may require us to use cash for severance payments  asset transfers and contract termination costs 
our working capital  including cash  was million at december   and has fluctuated between million and million over the last eight quarter ends 
the components of our working capital at december  and are set forth below in millions  followed by explanations for changes between and for cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and any other changes greater than million december  change current assets cash  cash equivalents and short term investments receivables  net inventories  net other current assets deferred income taxes total current assets current liabilities accounts payable accrued expenses income taxes payable accrued interest deferred income on sales to distributors current portion of long term debt total current liabilities net working capital 
table of contents the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million in was attributable to cash flow from operations of approximately million  partially offset by cash used in investing activities  excluding short term investment activity  of million and cash used in financing activities of million which was attributable to debt repayments see key financing events below 
the increase of million in accounts receivable is the result of increased sales in the last two months of the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in the decrease of million in inventory is attributable to sales levels exceeding production levels for the year 
inventory levels were a record low as of december  based on the outlook for the first quarter of  we anticipate relatively flat inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of the increase of million in other current assets is a result of a million reclassification of the net book value of certain assets held for sale  which includes buildings located in phoenix  arizona and east greenwich  rhode island that are currently being marketed for sale  and an increase of million in cash flow hedges  partially offset by a decrease of million in deferred compensation 
the balance of the increase is related to miscellaneous prepaid expenses for it projects in the united states 
the increase of million in accounts payable was mainly a result of the timing of payments at the respective year ends and an increase in fixed asset additions during the fourth quarter of of million  of which approximately million remained unpaid as of december   as compared to fixed asset additions of million in the fourth quarter of the decrease in accrued expenses of million was primarily attributable to the settlement of the us pension liability of million attributable to our pension plan for us employees and a decrease in the restructuring accrual of million  which was partially offset by an increase in the employee bonus accrual in the amount of million 
the increase in the current portion of long term debt relates to the timing of payments under our debt instruments including million related to required payments under the free cash flow provision of our senior bank facilities 
see note long term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
long term assets and liabilities our long term assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 
our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently 
accordingly  we reduced our capital expenditures during we do not expect that our capital expenditure reductions will have a negative impact on our ability to service our customers  as we believe that near term access to additional manufacturing capacity  should it be required  could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  there was an excess supply of used semiconductor production equipment in the marketplace  and we were able to purchase additional equipment at discounted prices 
we will continue to look for opportunities to make similar strategic purchases in the future as we plan to invest approximately million in for additional capacity 
although our debt covenants contain certain restrictions that limit our amount of future capital expenditures  we do not believe that these restrictions will have a significant impact on our future operating performance 
our long term liabilities  excluding long term debt  consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and tax reserves 
in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans  generally  our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the 
table of contents plans operate 
this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions

the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness 
upon conversion  the company has the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of the company s common stock 
april amendment to senior bank facilities and loan repricing on april  we refinanced million of loans under our senior bank facilities 
we replaced our tranche e term loan facility with a new tranche f term loan facility  which bore interest at a base rate plus a margin that is per annum lower than the comparable margin borne by the tranche e term loan facility 
principal repayments of the new tranche f term loan facility were to be due throughout and  provided that  if we had not redeemed or repurchased our second lien senior secured notes in full on or prior to november   the tranche f term loan facility would mature on november  additionally  in connection with this repricing  the senior bank facilities were amended to  among other things permit us to use for general corporate purposes up to million of the proceeds from the sale of the east greenwich manufacturing facility  subject to certain restrictions  permit us to apply the net proceeds of certain equity or debt issuances to be used to purchase  redeem or retire any of the first lien senior secured notes  second lien senior secured notes or junior subordinated note  amend the definition of consolidated ebitda in the credit agreement relating to the senior credit facilities to permit the add back of premiums associated with the redemption  repayment or repurchase of securities  and replace the existing revolving credit facility with a new facility that bore interest at a rate that was per annum lower than the rate borne by the then existing revolving facility 
december amendment to senior bank facilities and repurchase of senior secured notes in december  we refinanced the term loan portion of our senior bank facilities and increased our total borrowings under these facilities to million 
we replaced million of the tranche f term loan facility with million of a tranche g term loan facility with terms  other than the interest rate and principal balance  that are largely identical to those of the tranche f term loan facility 
proceeds from the tranche g term loan facility were used to acquire million principal outstanding of our first lien senior secured notes due and million principal outstanding of our second lien senior secured notes due principal payments under the tranche g term loan facility are paid quarterly at an annualized rate of of the original principal balance  with the remaining principal due at maturity 
the term loan portion of our credit facility 
table of contents expires december   however if the first date on which holders of at least million in aggregate principal amount of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due is extended currently april   the term loan will mature on the date which is six months prior to the first date on which holders may exercise such put rights 
in no event can the maturity date of the term loan be extended beyond december  we also increased the interest rate on our term loans by per annum 
costs incurred in connection with this refinancing totaled million  of which million were expensed as incurred while the remaining million of such costs were capitalized and are being amortized using the effective interest method 
as discussed above  in december we used proceeds from the refinancing of our senior bank facilities to repurchase and retire all of our outstanding first lien senior secured notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes that were redeemed and second lien senior secured notes at a redemption price of 
also in connection with this debt repurchase  we wrote off million of unamortized debt discounts  million of debt issuance costs and expensed million of third party expenses in connection therewith 
covenant revisions in the fourth quarter of after meeting certain financial conditions during the fourth quarter of  certain financial covenants were revised in our senior bank facilities to increase the maximum amount of sales  transfers and other dispositions of assets during any fiscal year to million aggregate fair market value  permit acquisitions of up to million in equity interests of other companies  increase the maximum amount of other investments to million  remove the minimum cash and cash equivalents requirement  and allow payment of fees and expenses in cash to tpg in an aggregate amount not to exceed million in any fiscal year

we issued an additional  shares of common stock to the tpg affiliate to induce the conversion of the preferred stock 
following the conversion  none of the authorized shares of the preferred stock remained outstanding 
in connection with the conversion and inducement  we recognized a million charge that reduced net income applicable to common stock for a deemed dividend from the issuance of inducement shares issued upon conversion 
december repayment of junior subordinated notes and issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes as part of the recapitalization  semiconductor components industries  llc  our primary domestic operating subsidiary  issued a million junior subordinated note due during periods it was outstanding  the note bore interest at an annual rate of  compounded semi annually and payable at maturity 
the note was junior in right of payment to all senior debt 
in november  we repaid million of the junior subordinated note with cash on hand  which reduced the outstanding principal amount to approximately million 
in order to finance the repayment of the remaining principal amount of the junior subordinated note  in december we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due we received 
table of contents net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of million  which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of december  the notes bear interest at the rate of per year from the date of issuance 
interest on the notes is payable on june and december of each year  beginning on june  the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries 
the notes are convertible by holders into cash and shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain events  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
we will settle conversion of all notes validly tendered for conversion in cash and shares of our common stock  if applicable  subject to our right to pay the share amount in additional cash 
holders may convert their notes under the following circumstances i during the five business day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate  ii upon occurrence of the specified transactions described in the indenture relating to the notes  or iii after june  the notes will mature on december  beginning december   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a price of of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date

the notes also will be effectively subordinated to any of our and our subsidiaries secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
january amendment to senior bank facilities in january  we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
the amended and restated credit agreement also provides for a step down provision that would further reduce the interest rate to libor plus if we maintain a specified credit rating and meet a specified leverage ratio test that would first apply based on the results

cash management our ability to manage cash is limited  as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements  contractual obligations  debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements 
while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases  we must invest in capital on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 
accounting changes effective december  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations statement refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded a net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change in  and we recorded a million liability for asset retirement obligations  included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
during the second quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit pension obligations 
historically  we amortized our net 
table of contents unrecognized actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining service lives of active plan participants  to the extent that such net gains or losses exceeded the greater of of the related projected benefit obligation or plan assets 
effective january   we no longer defer any actuarial gains or losses but recognize such gains and losses during the fourth quarter of each year  which is the period our annual pension plan actuarial valuations are prepared 
we believe that this change is to a preferable accounting method as actuarial gains or losses will be recognized currently in income rather than being deferred 
the impact of this change for periods prior to january  was a charge of million or per share  both before and after income taxes  and has been reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for the effect of the change in was to decrease the loss before cumulative effect of accounting change by million or per share  both before and after income taxes  and to increase the net loss by million or per share  both before and after income taxes 
absent the accounting change  the million of net unrecognized actuarial losses at december  would have been recognized as an operating expense in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note significant accounting policies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue 
we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers  electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors 
we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers when title passes to the customer net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances 
title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction  reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user 
although payment terms vary  most distributor agreements require payment within days 
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience 
given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products  our actual returns and allowances do not fluctuate significantly from period to period  and our returns and allowances provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 
freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 
inventories 
we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand 
projected end user demand is generally based on sales during the prior months 
these provisions can influence our results from operations 
for example  when demand falls for a given part  all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved  impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit 
if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold  we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin 
however  the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded 
although we do sell some products that have previously been 
table of contents written down  such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
in the fourth quarter of  a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
additionally  throughout  and  no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized 
as of december  and  gross deferred tax assets were million and million  respectively  and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results 
we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset 
the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 
in recent years  most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned  sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value 
when material  these gains are recorded in the restructuring  asset impairment and other  net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
goodwill 
we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
to date  our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 
for example  as of december   a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately million 
convertible redeemable preferred stock 
during the periods the convertible redeemable preferred stock was outstanding  we accounted for the difference between the carrying amount of the convertible redeemable preferred stock and the redemption value by increasing the carrying amount for periodic accretion so that the 
table of contents carrying amount would equal the redemption value at the earliest available redemption date 
the periodic accretion amount changed as our stock price changed and as additional dividends accrued 
based on the average closing price of our common stock over the last trading days preceding december  of  the accretion charge  in respect to the redemption feature  for was million 
we also recognized an additional accretion charge of million during the first quarter of however  due to declines in our stock price after the first quarter of  the average closing price used in the accretion calculation at the end of each quarter was below the level that would result in accretion 
the average closing price of our common stock over the last trading days preceding december  was 
therefore  the previously recognized accretion charges began to be reversed on a straight line basis through september   unless future increases to our stock price required further accretion 
during  previously recognized accretion charges of million were reversed  resulting in net accretion charges of million during on november   we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with tpg to convert the preferred stock into  shares of our common stock 
during  previously recognized accretion charges of million were reversed 
asset retirement obligations 
we recognize asset retirement obligations aros when incurred  with the initial measurement at fair value 
these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income 
in addition  asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related asset s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset s respective useful life 
our aros consist primarily of estimated decontamination costs associated with manufacturing equipment and buildings 
contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on the available information  we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and estimable 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  and shall be applied prospectively 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during the quarter ended september  our early adoption of sfas no 
resulted in no impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations statement refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a 
table of contents conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  based on our evaluation of fin  we recorded a net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change upon adoption of fin in  and recorded a million liability for asset retirement obligations  included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   our long term debt including current maturities totaled  million 
we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt  which totaled million 
we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt  however  from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps covering million of our variable interest rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
however  some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents as a result of the higher rates 
on january   we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility becomes less than million 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a multinational business  we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 
this strategy reduces  but does not eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products 
our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments  trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures  or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure
