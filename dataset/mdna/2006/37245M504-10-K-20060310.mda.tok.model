item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in february  genta has devoted its principal efforts toward drug discovery and research and development 
genta s strategy is to build a product and technology portfolio primarily focused on its cancer related products 
genta has been unprofitable to date and expects to incur substantial operating losses due to continued requirements for ongoing and planned research and development activities  preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing activities  regulatory activities and establishment of a sales and marketing organization 
from our inception to december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
management expects that such losses will continue at least until its lead product  genasense oblimersen sodium injection  receives approval from the us food and drug administration fda for commercial sale in one or more indications 
achievement of profitability for the company is dependent on the timing of genasense regulatory approvals in the us and outside the us the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  the company s recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about genta s ability to continue as a going concern and as a result  genta s independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on genta s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  with respect to this uncertainty 
in addition  on march   the company executed definitive subscription agreements with institutional investors to issue and sell million shares of our common stock at a price of per share raising approximately million  net of estimated fees and expenses 
the closing of this financing is expected to close on or about march   subject to the satisfaction of customary closing condition 
assuming the completion of this financing  management believes that at the projected rate of spending  including building our sales and marketing team and capabilities  we should have sufficient cash funds to maintain our present operations into the first quarter of the company has commenced discussions with several companies regarding partnership for the further development and global commercialization of genasense 
those discussions are currently ongoing 
additional alternatives available to the company to subsequently sustain its operations include other collaborative agreements  equity financing and other financing arrangements with potential corporate partners and other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that any such collaborative agreements or other sources of funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company will need substantial additional funds before it can expect to realize significant product revenue 
our financial results in have been and will continue to be significantly affected by fda action with respect to genasense 
in late  we filed our first nda with the fda for genasense as a treatment combined with chemotherapy for patients with advanced malignant melanoma 
in may  the application failed to gain a majority vote for marketing approval from odac 
as a consequence  genta withdrew the nda  which allows the company to potentially resubmit the application 
however  we continued long term follow up of patients who were enrolled in the advanced malignant melanoma trial 
on may   we announced updated data from our phase trial of genasense in patients with advance malignant melanoma at the american society of clinical oncology meeting 
the updated data continued to show statistical significance for overall response  complete response and progression free survival 
statistical significance was also achieved for durable response p 
we commissioned a new  independent review of the x rays that documented the major responses  which confirmed the originally reported responses with high concordance 
overall survival by intent to treat analysis had improved from the time of the fda filing but did not yield a statistically significant improvement at a significance level ie  p less than 
the p value at the time of the fda filing was  whereas the p value with the most recent analysis was 
our analysis also identified a statistically significant treatment interaction effect for blood levels of an enzyme known as ldh  which was one of three prospectively specified stratification factors in this trial 
when this effect was analyzed by treatment arm  survival and all other efficacy endpoints was significantly superior for patients who had received genasense p who did not have an elevation in ldh at study entry n 
on january   the company announced that it had completed an maa to the emea  which seeks approval for use of genasense plus dacarbazine for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma who have not previously received chemotherapy 
on february   the company announced that it had received notice from the emea that its maa had been validated for review by the agency  which signals the start of formal scientific assessment 
as part of this process  genta anticipates receiving scientific questions from emea in june and then expects to make a formal response thereafter 
in december  the company presented results from its third randomized trial  which was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory cll 
in this trial  patients who had relapsed or had not responded to prior therapy were treated with standard chemotherapy using fludarabine and cyclophosphamide flu cy 
after stratifying patients using conventional criteria  they were randomly assigned to receive genasense or no additional treatment 
initial results showed that the trial achieved its primary endpoint the proportion of patients who achieved a complete or nodular partial response cr npr was significantly improved with the addition of genasense to flu cy chemotherapy vs 
 p 
the response required independent confirmation by an external clinical reviewer who was blinded to treatment assignment and who reviewed clinical  laboratory and radiologic data 
a second independent reviewer evaluated bone marrow biopsies 
agreement between the clinical and bone marrow reviews was required in order to determine response in this study 
the cll trial also showed that the duration of cr npr was significantly superior for patients treated with genasense plus chemotherapy 
to date  six of the eight patients who achieved cr npr with chemotherapy alone have relapsed compared with five of twenty patients in the genasense treatment group 
the median duration of cr npr was months in the chemotherapy alone group  the median has not been reached in the genasense group p 
all cr npr responses have been durable ie  exceeding six months duration 
additional analysis showed that patients who achieved cr npr also experienced substantial clinical benefit  especially with respect to improvement of disease related symptoms 
several secondary endpoints were not improved by the addition of genasense 
for example  no difference was observed in overall response rate ie  the percentage of patients who achieved cr npr plus partial response pr  or in time to disease progression 
overall survival will be formally evaluated in mid after all patients have completed a minimum of two years of follow up 
adverse events irrespective of relation to study drugs during treatment or within days from last dose of treatment that resulted in death occurred in nine patients treated with genasense plus chemotherapy compared with five patients treated with chemotherapy alone 
the percentage of patients who experienced serious adverse events was increased in the genasense arm  however  the percentages of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events were equal in the treatment arms 
the incidence of certain serious adverse reactions  including but not limited to nausea  fever and catheter related complications  was increased in patients treated with genasense 
on december   the company completed submission of an nda to the fda that seeks accelerated approval for the use of genasense in combination with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory cll who have previously received fludarabine 
genasense has received fast track designation by the fda in cll  meaning that the indication represents an unmet medical need 
genasense has also been granted designation as an orphan drug by the fda 
on march   the company announced that the nda had been accepted for review by the fda and set a target action date of october  however  acceptance of this nda does not necessarily lead to fda approval 
following its review of all the company s information concerning genasense  the fda may refuse to approve altogether  or may ask for more data to be obtained  so that approval can be reconsidered 
either of these two decisions by the fda would have a material adverse effect on our business 
one of the requirements for accelerated approval is that the company will be required to conduct a confirmatory trial 
the company has formulated a design for such a trial and has submitted a proposal to the fda for review as a special protocol assessment spa 
the submitted proposal incorporated initial comments received from the fda 
final comments on the submission are expected during the first half of formal initiation of the trial will depend upon resolution of trial design issues with the fda  among other factors 
although fast track designation  orphan drug designation and accelerated approval provisions are beneficial  we cannot assure you that the nda will be approved 
in particular  the fda may not be satisfied that achievement of the primary endpoint used in the company s recent clinical trial being an increased proportion of complete responses nodular partial responses compared to patients treated with standard chemotherapy is sufficient basis for approval 
further  increased symptom free time may not be considered to be sufficient demonstration of clinical benefit 
in november  genta reported that the company s randomized phase clinical trial of genasense in patients with multiple myeloma did not meet its primary endpoint 
the trial had been designed to evaluate whether the addition of genasense to standard therapy with high dose dexamethasone could increase the time to development of progressive disease in patients who previously had received extensive therapy 
based on the results of the phase trial  the company has no plans to submit an nda in this indication at the current time 
the company has not yet determined what additional clinical trials  if any  may be undertaken in patients with multiple myeloma 
in addition  the company is conducting under its own sponsorship or in conjunction with various cooperative groups randomized trials in non small cell lung cancer nsclc  small cell lung cancer sclc  acute myeloid leukemia aml and hormone refractory prostate cancer hrpc 
we are also conducting a number of non randomized clinical trials in patients with various types of cancer  either under our own sponsorship or in collaboration with the national cancer institute nci 
in april  we entered into a series of agreements with aventis regarding the development and commercialization of genasense 
on november   the company received from aventis notice of termination of the agreements between genta and aventis 
on may   the company announced that genta and aventis had signed an agreement to finalize the termination of their development and commercialization collaboration for genasense 
the termination agreement provided for no future financial obligations by either party and the retirement of the line of credit established by aventis to genta 
aventis returned its current inventory of genasense drug supply to genta 
in addition  genta assumed responsibility for the randomized clinical trial of genasense in combination with docetaxel taxotere  sanofi aventis in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer  which is currently ongoing in europe 
among other provisions  the standstill and voting agreement and registration rights agreement that were established pursuant to the aventis investment in genta common stock in were not terminated at that time

on november   aventis gave notice to genta that it was terminating its collaborative agreement with the company regarding the development and commercialization of genasense 
under the terms of the collaborative agreement  aventis continued to fund ongoing development activities through may  the company had previously determined that  due to the nature of the ongoing development work related to the collaborative agreement  the end of the development phase and the fair value of the undelivered elements were not determinable 
accordingly  we deferred recognition of the initial licensing fee and up front development funding received from aventis and recognized these payments on a straight line basis over the original estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months 
as a result of the notice of termination of the collaborative agreement  the company determined that the period over which the remaining deferred revenue should be recognized was through may  on november   we began to recognize the remaining deferred revenue over a six month period  resulting in increased revenue of million during and million during in  the company launched the commercial product ganite for the treatment of cancer related hypercalcemia that is resistant to hydration  generating million in product sales 
in  the company eliminated its sales force and significantly reduced its marketing support for ganite 
in december  a wholesaler contacted the company to return a significant portion of its inventory of ganite 
the company agreed to the return of this product and recorded a provision for sales returns  as well as provided for potential returns from other wholesalers 
our provision for sales returns increased by million in  resulting in net sales of million for sales of ganite during were million 
cost of goods sold during  we recorded provisions for excess ganite inventory of million 
excluding the provision for excess inventory  cost of goods sold for decreased from the prior year period  consistent with the decline in product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses before reimbursement were million in compared to million in and million in approximately million or of research and development expenses before reimbursement were incurred on the genasense project for the twelve months ended december  in the prior year period  approximately million or of research and development expenses before reimbursement were incurred on the genasense project 
included in the million was million related to the expensing of vialed genasense product and genasense bulk drug substance  much of which had been originally produced and acquired to be commercial inventory and other expenses related to the manufacturing and purchase of genasense bulk drug substance 
research and development expenses in also declined due to our decision in may to reduce staff and reduce most non genasense related programs as well as a lower level of activity on clinical trials 
of the million in research and development expenses for the year ended december   million were reimbursable pursuant to our collaborative agreement with aventis 
with the aventis notice of termination  payments otherwise due to genta were applied against the balance of the line of credit until it was repaid in may see note to our financial statements 
research and development expenses in include a million write off of acquired in process research and development resulting from the august acquisition of salus therapeutics  inc in august  genta completed the closure of its research facility in salt lake city  which had originated from the acquisition of salus therapeutics  inc excluding these items  research and development expenses declined million in  primarily resulting from our decision in may to reduce staff and reduce most non genasense related programs  as well as from the comparison to a prior year period where expenses were significantly higher resulting from genasense phase clinical trials and nda preparation activities 
research and development expenses incurred on the genasense project in were approximately million  representing of research and development expenses after excluding the write off of acquired in process research and development expenses 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete projects in development are not reasonably estimable 
results from clinical trials may not be favorable 
data from clinical trials are subject to varying interpretation and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  clinical development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in lower expenses in reflect the impact of the may elimination of the sales force  reduction of other administrative positions and substantial reduction of marketing support for ganite 
in addition  during  we recorded million of legal expenses related to certain class action lawsuits see note to our financial statements 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million compared to as a higher rate of spending in the first half of the year  in anticipation of approval and launch of genasense  was more than offset by the impact of the elimination of the sales force and other cost cutting measures 
loss on disposition of property and equipment in august  we completed the closure of our research facility in salt lake city  sold all related equipment and assigned our lease on the facility to another company 
additionally  we disposed of excess equipment at corporate headquarters 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a loss on disposition of property and equipment of approximately million 
aventis reimbursement a breakdown of the various third party  drug supply costs and internal costs of scientific and technical personnel  full time equivalents or fte s that aventis was required to reimburse under our collaborative agreement with aventis  follows reimbursement to genta third party costs    drug supply costs    fte s    amount due to genta    reimbursement to aventis   net reimbursement to genta    net expense reimbursement from aventis of million for declined from million for due to the termination of the collaborative agreement in may and lower expenses incurred on the genasense project 
in addition  in september  the company transferred million of vialed genasense drug product and genasense bulk drug substance to aventis 
this amount is included in drug supply costs in the above table 
once aventis provided notice of termination of the collaborative agreement  all payments otherwise due from aventis were applied against the balance on the line of credit until the line of credit was repaid in may net expense reimbursement from aventis of million for decreased from million for primarily due to the greater activity and expenses in resulting from the nda filing for genasense 
purchases of drug material were expensed as incurred and were not reimbursable pursuant to our collaborative agreement with aventis until they were used in clinical trials 
reimbursement to aventis consisted of our share of third party costs incurred by aventis and internal costs of aventis scientific and technical personnel 
gain on forgiveness of debt gain on forgiveness of debt of million in and million in is the result of the termination of the collaborative agreement with sanofi aventis 
in  pursuant to the terms of the collaborative agreement  million of reimbursable costs accrued and owed to the company by aventis were applied against the line of credit with aventis and the remaining balance of million was forgiven 
in  under the terms of the collaborative agreement  aventis forgave the million of convertible debt issued to them in connection with the collaboration  along with million in accrued interest  resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
other income expense net other income of million in favorably compared to net other expense of million for the prior year 
this was the result of lower interest expense  due to the company having no debt since may  partially offset by lower interest income  resulting from lower investment balances 
net other expense of million in unfavorably compared to net other income of million in  primarily due to lower average investment balances throughout as compared to income tax benefit expense new jersey has enacted legislation permitting certain corporations located in the state to sell state tax loss carryforwards and state research and development credits 
the company sold portions of its new jersey net operating losses in both and and received a payment of million in each year that is recognized as income tax benefit 
in  the benefit was offset by million of an accrued income tax expense that has arisen from a state of new jersey tax audit for the years through the state has taken the position that amounts reimbursed to the company by aventis for co development expenditures during the audit period are subject to new jersey s alternative minimum assessment 
although the company and its outside tax accountants believe the state s position is unjustified  there is little case law on the matter and it is probable that the company will be required to pay the liability in if still available under new jersey law  the company will attempt to sell its tax loss carryforwards in we cannot be assured that the new jersey program will continue in  nor can we estimate what percentage of our saleable tax benefits new jersey will permit us to sell  how much money will be received in connection with the sale  or if the company will be able to find a buyer for its tax benefits 
net loss genta incurred a net loss of million  or per share  for  million  or per share  for and million  or per share  for in  the improvement in net loss and per share net loss to common shareholders was primarily due to accelerated recognition through may of the initial licensing fee and up front development funding previously received from aventis  lower research and development expenses  lower selling  general and administrative expenses  along with a gain on forgiveness of debt

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
in april  the securities and exchange commission approved a ruling that delayed the effective date of sfas r for annual rather than interim periods that begin after june  under the new standard  all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options will now be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  as pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument issued 
the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based upon research done by the company on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future  the company has determined that it will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation as of the current time 
for the years ended december   and  we accounted for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with apb no 
 and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas sfas r requires all public entities that used the fair value method for either recognition or disclosure under sfas to apply the modified prospective transition method as of the required effective date 
as a result  we adopted the provisions of sfas r using this method  effective january  under the modified prospective method  new awards will be valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption 
outstanding prior awards that are unvested as of january  will be recognized as compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period 
prior periods will not be restated 
the adoption of sfas r is anticipated to increase our reported net loss and loss per share 
management forecasts that the impact of adopting sfas r for the twelve months ending december  will be between million and million  taking into account options granted in january this forecast is based on the black scholes option pricing model and includes estimates on the additional number of options to be granted during  the price of our stock at the time of grants  the volatility of our stock price and the expected forfeiture rates 
as such  our actual stock option expense may differ from this estimate 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following represent its critical accounting policies o revenue recognition 
our policy is to recognize revenues under license arrangements when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties are recognized when earned 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  initial funding of ongoing development received from aventis  after the achievement of certain research and development milestones were being recognized on a straight line basis over the original estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months 
on november  we received from aventis notice of termination of the agreements between genta and aventis  with an effective termination date of may  accordingly  we started recognizing the remaining balance of the initial funding on a straight line basis over the time period from november  through may  see note to our financial statements 
genta recognizes revenue from product sales when title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer and we are reasonably assured of collecting payment for the sale 
all revenue from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns  rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances 
we allow return of our product for up to twelve months after product expiration 
in december  a wholesaler contacted the company to return a significant portion of its inventory of ganite 
the company agreed to the return of this product and recorded a provision for sales returns  as well as provided for potential returns from other wholesalers 
our provision for sales returns increased by million in in january  the wholesaler returned million of ganite 
at december   the company s remaining provision for sales returns was million 
o research and development costs 
all such costs are expensed as incurred  including raw material costs required to manufacture drugs for clinical trials 
reimbursements for applicable genasense related costs under the collaborative agreement  have been recorded as a reduction to expense in the consolidated statements of operations see note to our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million  a decline of million from million at december  during  cash flow used in operating activities was million compared with million in this decline reflects our smaller organization  focus on genasense and lower level of activity on clinical trials 
at december   genta had no outstanding short term debt compared with the outstanding balance of million on the line of credit with aventis as of december  the company s recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about genta s ability to continue as a going concern and as a result  genta s independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on genta s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  with respect to this uncertainty 
in addition  on march   the company executed definitive subscription agreements with institutional investors to issue and sell million shares of our common stock at a price of per share raising approximately million  net of estimated fees and expenses 
assuming the completion of this financing  management believes that at the projected rate of spending  including building our sales and marketing team and capabilities  we should have sufficient cash funds to maintain our present operations into the first quarter of the closing of this financing is expected to close on or about march   subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
the company commenced discussions with several companies regarding partnership for the further development and global commercialization of genasense 
those discussions are currently ongoing 
additional alternatives available to the company to subsequently sustain its operations include other collaborative agreements  equity financing and other financing arrangements with potential corporate partners and other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that any such collaborative agreements or other sources of funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company will need substantial additional funds before it can expect to realize significant product revenue 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million  a decline of million from million at december  during  cash flow used in operating activities was million  primarily resulting from a net loss of million and non cash reimbursements of research and development expenses of million 
partially offsetting this outflow  in december  we raised million  net of issuance costs  from the issuance of common stock 
at december   the company had million outstanding compared to million as of december  on the line of credit from aventis 
during  as a result of certain non cash transactions  the company reduced amounts owed under the line of credit by million 
as a result of aventis purchase commitments to genta  in september we supplied million of vialed genasense drug product and genasense bulk drug substance to aventis 
this amount is included in the company s consolidated statement of operations as aventis reimbursement 
the companies agreed to offset amounts owed under the line of credit by million and accrued interest on the line of credit by million 
with the aventis notice of termination  genta could not borrow additional funds and the line of credit had to be repaid no later than may  all payments otherwise due to genta were applied against the balance on the line of credit until the line of credit was repaid 
in  million of reimbursement due to genta was applied to the balance of the line of credit 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million declined million from million at december  during  cash flow used in operating activities was million  primarily resulting from a net loss of million and lower accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
partially offsetting this outflow were borrowings under the line of credit from aventis of million 
our principal expenditures relate to our research and development activities  primarily focused on genasense  which include our ongoing and future clinical trials 
we expect these expenditures to continue 
the company may seek collaborative agreements and other financing arrangements with potential corporate partners and other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that any such collaborative agreements or other sources of funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company will need substantial additional funds before it can expect to realize significant product revenue 
if we obtain nda approval of genasense for one or more applications  we anticipate seeking additional product development opportunities through potential acquisitions or investments 
such acquisitions or investments may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
our working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of our research and development programs  ii the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that we devote to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  vi our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products and vii legal costs and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings 
contractual obligations future contractual obligations at december  are as follows thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations     total     not included in the above table are any genasense bulk drug purchase obligations to avecia per the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement entered into between avecia and genta in december the agreement calls for genta to purchase a percentage of our global genasense bulk drug requirements from avecia during the term of the agreement 
due to the uncertainties regarding the timing of any genasense approval and sales volume projections  specific obligation amounts cannot be estimated at this time 
due to past purchases of genasense bulk drug substance  the company has access to sufficient drug for its current needs 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our carrying values of cash  marketable securities  accounts payable  accrued expenses and debt are a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies see note to our financial statements 
we have not entered into and do not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
genta s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on such instruments 
we have no material currency exchange or interest rate risk exposure as of december  therefore there will be no ongoing exposure to material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation for sensitivity to changes in interest rates or to changes in currency exchange rates
