item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subtitled pfoa and note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company may make certain commitments  including representations  warranties  indemnities and guarantees of third party obligations 
if the company were required to make payments as a result  they could exceed the amounts accrued  thereby adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
for further information see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 
the company s operations are subject to various federal  state and international laws and regulations governing the environment  including the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the management and disposal of hazardous substances 
the company could incur substantial costs  including cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims 
the costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations  as well as internal voluntary programs  are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future 
the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict 
the company s accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the allegation  the complexity of the site  site geology  the nature and extent of contamination  the type of remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other prps 
it is the company s policy that all of its operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements for protecting the environment

the company s ability to generate sales from genetically enhanced products  particularly seeds and other agricultural products  could be adversely affected by market acceptance  government policies  rules or regulations and competition 
the company is using biotechnology to create and improve products  particularly in its agriculture nutrition segment 
demand for these products could be affected by market acceptance of genetically modified products as well as governmental policies  laws and regulations that affect the development  manufacture and distribution of products  including the testing and planting of seeds containing biotechnology traits  and the import of crops grown from those seeds 
the company competes with major  global companies that have strong intellectual property estates supporting the use of biotechnology to enhance products  particularly in the agricultural products and production markets 
speed in discovering and protecting new technologies  and bringing products based on them to market is a significant competitive advantage 
failure to predict and respond effectively to this competition could cause the company s existing or candidate products to become less competitive adversely affecting sales 
changes in government policies and laws or worldwide economic conditions could adversely affect the company s financial results 
sales outside the us constitute more than half of the company s revenue 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales and that continued growth and profitability will require further international expansion 
the company s financial results could be affected by changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  or other activities of us and us governments  agencies and similar organizations 
these conditions include but are not limited to changes in a country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade regulations affecting production  pricing and marketing of products  local labor conditions and regulations  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  restrictions on currency exchange activities  burdensome taxes and tariffs and other trade barriers 
international risks and uncertainties  including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism  political hostilities and war  could lead to reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales 
economic factors  including inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices could affect the company s financial results 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
because the company has significant international operations  there are a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales  purchases  investments  and borrowings 
the company actively manages currency exposures that are associated with monetary asset positions  committed currency purchases and sales  and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business 
failure to successfully manage these risks could have an adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
business disruptions could seriously impact the company s future revenue and financial condition and increase costs and expenses 
business disruptions  including supply disruptions  increasing costs for energy  temporary plant and or power outages  natural disasters and severe weather events  such as hurricanes  and pandemics  could seriously harm the company s operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers 
although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events  they could result in reduced demand for the company s products  make it difficult or impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers or to receive raw materials from suppliers  create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions 
the impact from business disruptions could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact the company s financial performance 
inability to protect and enforce the company s intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company s financial results 
intellectual property rights are important to the company s business 
the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported 
however  the company may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions 
the extent to which the company is unable to protect its intellectual property could have an adverse impact its financial results 
the company is subject to information system security risks and systems integration issues that could disrupt the company s internal operations 
the company is dependent upon technology for the distribution of information within the company and to customers and suppliers 
this information technology is vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including but not limited to computer viruses  security breach and defects in design 
there also could be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly 
various measures have been implemented to manage the company s risks related to information system and network disruptions  but a system failure or security breach could negatively impact the company s operations and financial results

environmental proceedings acid plants new source review enforcement action in  the epa issued a notice of violation and finding of violation for the company s fort hill sulfuric acid plant in north bend  ohio 
the epa conducted a review of capital projects at the plant over the past twenty years 
based on its review  the epa believes that two of the projects triggered a requirement to meet the new source performance standards for sulfuric acid plants and that the company should have sought a permit under the new source review requirements of the clean air act caa 
in july  the epa issued a notice of violation for the james river acid plant with similar allegations 
the company vigorously disagrees with the epa s findings because the epa continues to change its interpretation of these rules and requirements without going through the required process to amend them 
the courts are split on these interpretations 
the company has a total of four sulfuric acid plants that use similar technology 
the epa has invited the company to engage in settlement negotiations  but insists that all four sulfuric acid plants be included 
since there can be no assurance that the company will prevail if it litigates this matter  the company has accepted the epa s invitation and has proposed to install technology at the four plants  or shut them down over the next five years 
the epa has yet to agree on the emission limits and the timing 
if the negotiations are successful  the resulting settlement would include capital expenditures as well as a penalty 
however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of such costs at this time 
chambers works plant  new jersey on january   dupont s chambers works plant in new jersey received a draft administrative consent order from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep proposing a penalty of  for incidents that occurred between november and october involving minor spills of product and wastes  and technical violations of the resource  conservation and recovery act rcra permitting provisions 
the njdep has alleged that the foregoing are violations of the new jersey solid waste management act and spill compensation and control act 
the proposed penalty does not take into account dupont s actions to mitigate the potential impact of these events and substantial commitments to minimize discharges in the future 
the company is negotiating with the njdep 
pfoa west virginia and ohio departments of environmental protection for purposes of this report  the term pfoa means collectively perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts  including the ammonium salt  and does not distinguish between the two forms 
dupont uses pfoa as a processing aid to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions at its washington works plant in wood county  west virginia 
currently  dupont recovers or destroys percent of the pfoa that potentially could be emitted or discharged during the manufacturing process at the washington works plant 
in november  the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep and dupont signed a multimedia consent order the wv order that requires environmental sampling and analyses and the development of screening levels for pfoa that is used or managed by the washington works plant 
as a result of this process  wvdep issued its final ammonium perfluorooctanoate assessment of toxicity team report in august in the report  the wvdep established a screening level of micrograms pfoa per liter screening level for drinking water and a soil screening level of parts per million 
none of the local sources for drinking water has tested at or above the screening level 
the report established a screening level of microgram per cubic meter for air 
dupont submitted to the wvdep its initial air dispersion modeling results for the period between september and august which demonstrated that the air screening level was not exceeded during the time period 
unless dupont violates its terms  the wv order does not call for sanctions 
dupont has completed all major activities currently required by the wv order and has spent approximately million through december   in connection with these activities 
dupont committed to conduct additional environmental monitoring in and around the washington works plant 
as recommended by wvdep  this testing began in and will end in environmental sampling of the pfoa levels in the groundwater and drinking water has been conducted across the ohio river pursuant to a memorandum of understanding among dupont  the ohio environmental protection agency  the wvdep  and the division of health and human resources  the mou 
under the mou  these results were shared with the ohio epa 
also  dupont is funding investigations of ground and drinking water in that state comparable to the studies in west virginia  pursuant to the mou 
in addition  dupont signed a safe drinking water consent sdwc order with epa region iii which includes west virginia and region v which includes ohio in march of to assure provision of alternative drinking water if supplies are found to exceed screening levels established under the wv order 
since the pfoa concentrations in drinking water tested to date are significantly below the screening level  it is unlikely that dupont will be required to provide alternative drinking water under the sdwc order 
pursuant to discussions with  and recommendations from the ohio epa  dupont is conducting additional environmental monitoring in ohio  starting in and ending in sabine river works  orange  texas on november   dupont received a notice of enforcement action notice from the texas commission on environmental quality tceq regarding its sabine river works facility located in orange  texas 
the notice contains allegations relating to reportable and non reportable emission events from through and assesses an administrative penalty of  dupont will contest the allegations in the event that negotiations with tceq are unsuccessful 
gibson city  illinois the epa has alleged that the solae company violated the caa s new source review regulations and certain prevention of significant deterioration requirements at its plant in gibson city  illinois

going where the growth is the company seeks significant growth opportunities by increasing its direct presence and sales efforts in emerging markets and extending the company s science  products  brands and market position into new applications and uses  thereby creating new markets 
the company has a strong presence in the fastest growing emerging markets and continues to leverage its resources and market position to realize new growth 
analysis of operations during  the company maintained its leading position in biotechnology  safety and protection  and crop yield improvement  and continued to execute its growth strategies  while overcoming a number of operational and business challenges 
the most significant of these challenges were record high energy costs  in addition to the aftermath of two major hurricanes  katrina and rita  which struck the gulf coast region of the us management estimates that cost increases for raw materials in exceeded billion versus the prior year  principally reflecting higher market prices for oil  natural gas  and hydrocarbon feedstock 
the company took actions to increase pricing and improve productivity to offset these cost increases 
the company has manufacturing plants located in the gulf coast region that were affected by the hurricanes 
ten of these had minimal damage and resumed operations quickly 
four plants  two in mississippi and two in texas  experienced serious damage to electrical systems  instrument controls and computer based electronic process control systems 
charges of million were recorded in related to the clean up and repair of manufacturing assets  the write off of inventory and plant assets destroyed by the hurricanes and other hurricane related costs 
the most significant damage was to the company s delisle  mississippi  titanium dioxide plant which remained shut down from august until production began a phased in restart in january management expects this plant to return to normal operations during the second quarter of the resumption of operations at the other three sites was completed by december  all sites remain structurally sound and environmentally secure 
following the hurricanes  the company declared force majeure for several product lines of the coatings color technologies  safety protection and the performance materials segments manufactured at the four sites noted above  because of hurricane induced plant outages  limited availability of purchased utilities and raw materials  and damaged infrastructure

the amount or timing of any insurance recoveries are not yet determinable

the decrease relative to sales reflects a significant benefit from portfolio changes  principally the sale of invista  which had higher cogs in relation to sales than the rest of the company 
cogs as a percent of sales also improved due to higher local selling prices and increased sales volumes with higher gross margins due to improved operating rates  lower plant operating costs  and higher manufacturing yields 
the currency impact from the weaker usd also had a positive impact as its benefit to sales exceeded its concurrent increase in cogs 
the positive factors discussed above were partly offset by increased litigation charges and significantly higher raw material costs

in addition  the value of the usd is forecast to be stronger than the average  adversely affecting the results of the company s operations outside of the us on the positive side  the company expects that its costs for pensions and other postretirement benefits will be lower than those for based on these expectations  management estimates that earnings per share will be about in  with net sales of about billion 
accounting standards issued not yet adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
dupont voluntarily adopted the sfas no 
fair value based method of accounting on january   for share based payment transactions with employees 
sfas no 
r amends some aspects of the fair value measurement of the equity instruments granted to employees 
this statement becomes effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of the company will use the modified prospective method and will continue to use the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for its awards 
based on the company s evaluation  the adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts  including  but not limited to  receivable and inventory valuations  impairment of tangible and intangible assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  income taxes  restructuring reserves  environmental matters  and litigation 
management s estimates are based on historical experience  facts and circumstances available at the time  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate 
management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates 
discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
management reviews these two key assumptions at least annually 
these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate 
as permitted by gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis  and to the extent that such differences exceed percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets  the excess is amortized over the average remaining working life of current employees 
about percent of the company s benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company s other postretirement benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the us the company utilizes published long term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the measurement date 
where commonly available  the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments 
within the us  the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk 
strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries 
where appropriate  asset liability studies are also taken into consideration 
the long term expected return on plan assets in the us is based upon historical real returns net of inflation for the asset classes covered by the investment policy and projections of inflation over the long term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants 
in determining annual expense for the principal us pension plan  the company uses a market related value of assets rather than their fair value 
accordingly  there tends to be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation 
as a result  changes in the fair market value of assets is not immediately reflected in the company s calculation of net pension cost 
the market related value for the principal us pension plan was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the corresponding fair value was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
for other plans  pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets 
the fair value of assets in all pension plans was billion at december   and the related projected benefit obligations were billion 
in addition  obligations under the company s unfunded other postretirement benefit plans were billion at december  the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  dollars in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease discount rate expected rate of return on plan pension assets additional information with respect to pension and other postretirement employee expenses  liabilities  and assumptions is discussed under long term employee benefits beginning on page environmental matters dupont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made 
the company s estimates are based on a number of factors  including the complexity of the geology  the nature and extent of contamination  the type of remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other prps at multiparty sites  and the number of and financial viability of other prps 
the company has recorded a liability of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted 
considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and  under adverse changes in circumstances  the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued 
much of this liability results from the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  often referred to as the superfund  rcra and similar state laws 
these laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company generated waste was disposed 
the accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required  but which are not currently the subject of cercla  rcra or state enforcement activities 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations  and could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company generated waste disposal 
over the next two decades  the company could incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra 
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site 
these activities  and their associated costs  depend on the mix of unique site characteristics  evolving remediation technologies  diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies  as well as the presence or absence of prps 
therefore  it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of future site remediation costs 
a detailed discussion of environmental matters is contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page legal contingencies the company s results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company  including product liability claims  patent infringement claims and antitrust claims 
the company records reserves for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management makes adjustments to these reserves to reflect the impact and status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter 
predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits  and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims  the company s experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  input from outside legal counsel  the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter s current status 
considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation reserve when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding 
in such situations  the company will not recognize a loss if  based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information  management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal 
a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the breadth of the company s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company s tax assets and tax liabilities 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies 
for example  changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance  thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period 
in some situations these changes could be material 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of million  net of valuation allowance of  million 
realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time 
as a result  changes in tax laws  assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets 
during  it is reasonably possible that valuation allowances related to the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries estimated to be about million will be reversed if improved business performance in those subsidiaries is sustained 
this potential valuation allowance reversal is not reflected in the company s current estimate of the effective income tax rate of about percent 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  net of valuation allowances of  million 
of this amount  million has no expiration date  million expires after but before the end of  and million expires after valuation of assets assessment of the potential impairment of property  plant and equipment  goodwill  other purchased intangible assets  and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company s normal ongoing review of operations 
testing for potential impairment of long lived assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management s best estimates at a particular point in time 
the dynamic economic environments in which the company s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices  market growth and inflation rates  can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests 
estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results 
changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on both the existence and magnitude of impairments  as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized 
future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges 
information with respect to the company s significant accounting policies on long lived assets is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

sales from these products declined modestly in  primarily due to reduced sales in parts of europe and asia pacific 
versus sales of billion increased percent reflecting percent higher usd selling prices and percent lower volumes 
higher selling prices reflect a richer mix in corn and soybean seed 
volume declines were driven by lower corn seed sales in north america and specialty food ingredients partially offset by increases in the sale of soybeans  insecticides in latin america and herbicides for cereals in europe 
during the year approximately new products and product applications were introduced 
ptoi was million versus million in  up percent 
the improvement in ptoi reflects higher usd selling prices partially offset by lower volumes and higher raw material costs 
results also included restructuring charges of million

the key markets in which coatings color technologies operates continued to grow in  with more significant growth in the latin america and asia pacific regions 
a key driver of the segment s sales growth in was the successful implementation of global price increases  most notably  for titanium dioxide white pigment and refinish products 
global demand for titanium dioxide white pigment remained consistent with levels 
sales volumes for major global producers of titanium dioxide white pigment declined by approximately to percent  while volumes increased for small producers in china  india  and eastern europe which generally provide lower performance and lower price products 
during the first half of the year  the company s market share grew slightly  however  share in the second half declined as a result of hurricane damage to the company s delisle plant 
sales for refinish products grew in all regions  most notably in the us  europe  and latin america 
while the oem market realized growth in latin america  it was more than offset by declines in the us  europe  and asia pacific 
this reflects flat or lower north american and european builds of automobiles and light trucks 
powder coatings remained flat in europe  while the demand in the us and latin america showed improvement 
worldwide sales in the specialty coatings  electrical insulation and metal coatings markets continued to improve  while adhesives remained flat 
versus sales of billion were up percent  reflecting percent higher usd selling prices  partly offset by percent lower volumes 
higher selling prices reflect concerted efforts within the segment to increase prices for the majority of its products as part of its efforts to offset the impact of higher raw material costs 
sales volumes were lower due to the delisle plant outage and the impact of lower global oem automotive volumes 
during the year approximately new products and product applications were introduced 
ptoi in of million decreased from million in the prior year 
higher raw material costs and lower sales volumes negatively affected earnings 
ptoi in includes a million hurricane charge while included charges of million for employee separation costs and an automotive refinish litigation settlement 
versus sales of billion increased percent  principally reflecting a percent benefit from the weaker dollar  percent higher sales volumes  and percent higher local prices 
the increase in volumes is primarily related to titanium dioxide as capacity utilization for global titanium dioxide producers grew throughout the year  with all major producers essentially sold out beginning late in third quarter oem coatings volume growth moderated in the second half as major auto producers  particularly in the us  announced production cutbacks to reduce new car inventories 
ptoi was million in  down slightly from million in higher sales volumes and local selling price increases essentially offset net charges totaling million for employee separation costs and million related to the automotive refinishes litigation settlement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
higher raw material  energy  and product distribution costs reduced ptoi by approximately million 
higher fixed costs were largely driven by currency translation rates in the coatings businesses  and by spending for growth initiatives in the titanium dioxide business 
outlook the segment expects to increase sales modestly in  while taking actions to improve profitability 
critical to improving the segment s profitability is the sustainability of price increases to offset higher raw materials and other costs and the successful restoration of full operations at the delisle titanium dioxide plant 
industry demand for titanium dioxide is expected to remain strong sustaining continued high capacity utilization 
competitive conditions in the global coatings industry will continue to provide a challenging operating environment in modest growth is expected for refinish markets on flat volumes in mature economies while strong growth is expected to continue in emerging markets 
profitability of coatings sold to oem producers is highly dependent upon volume at specific plants the company services 
us and european automotive builds are expected to be essentially flat with levels  with moderate growth in asia pacific

pharmaceuticals segment sales dollars in billions ptoi dollars in millions on october   dupont pharmaceuticals was sold to the bristol myers squibb company 
dupont retained its interest in cozaar losartan potassium and hyzaar losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide 
these aiia drugs were discovered by dupont and developed in collaboration with merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension 
the us patents covering the compounds  pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension  including approval for pediatric use  will expire in dupont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for cozaar and hyzaar to merck

through  approvals based on the renaal study have been granted in countries  with further approvals pending 
the losartan intervention for endpoint reduction in hypertension study life results were reported and published in march at the annual meeting of the american college of cardiology 
the study found that use of cozaar significantly reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death  heart attack and stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy lvh compared to the beta blocker atenolol 
in march  the fda approved cozaar as the first and only hypertensive medicine to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and lvh 
in total  countries have granted regulatory licenses to cozaar based on the life study 
in  the fda approved hyzaar to reduce the risk of stroke based on the life study 
the fda granted a new indication for hyzaar in for use in patients with severe hypertension 
this fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension  except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients 
in  hyzaar mg tablets were introduced offering a new treatment alternative for doctors with patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by cozaar mg alone 
outlook dupont and merck continue to support cozaar and hyzaar with clinical studies designed to identify additional therapeutic benefits for patients with hypertension and co morbid conditions 
the company expects the ongoing cozaar hyzaar collaboration to continue to be an important contributor to earnings until the us patents expire in thereafter  earnings are expected to decline significantly

liquidity capital resources the company s liquidity needs can be met through a variety of independent sources  including cash provided by operating activities  cash and cash equivalents  marketable debt securities  commercial paper  syndicated credit lines  bilateral credit lines  equity and long term debt markets  and asset sales 
the company s relatively low long term borrowing level  strong financial position and credit ratings provide excellent access to these markets 
in october  standard poor s s p  moody s investors service moody s  and fitch ratings fitch downgraded the company s long term debt credit rating following the company s announced billion share buyback program 
the company s management expected this revision and believes that it will have a minimal impact on the company s borrowing costs and ability to access capital markets 
the credit rating agencies left the company s short term credit ratings at or near the highest rating levels 
the company s long term lt and short term st rating history at year end over the last three years follows lt st outlook lt st outlook lt st outlook s p a a stable aa a negative aa a negative moody s a p negative aa p stable aa p stable fitch a f stable aa f stable not rated the company s liquidity  financial position and flexibility remain strong and management considers this strength to be a competitive advantage 
this advantage is based on strong business operating cash flows over an economic cycle  and a commitment to cash discipline regarding working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
pursuant to its cash discipline policy  the company seeks first  to maintain a strong balance sheet and second  to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances of billion and bank credit lines of billion as of december   provide primary liquidity to support all short term obligations 
secondary liquidity  sufficient to meet upcoming debt maturities  comes from excellent access to capital markets  strong cash flow generation and the ability to sell assets 
management believes that the company s ability to generate cash and access the capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements to fund working capital  capital spending  dividend payments and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
in the unlikely event that the company would not be able to meet its short term liquidity needs  the company has access to approximately billion in same day credit lines with several major financial institutions 
these credit lines are primarily multi year facilities 
dollars in millions cash provided by operating activities    the company s cash provided by operating activities was billion in  a million decrease from the billion generated in the year over year decrease principally reflects higher contributions to pension plans  primarily a billion contribution to the principal us pension plan 
changes in accounts receivable and inventories were modest 
working capital productivity measures of days sales outstanding  inventory days supply and days payable outstanding in were essentially flat versus the company s cash provided by operating activities was billion in  a million increase from the billion generated in the year over year increase was primarily the result of higher earnings in cash provided by operations in was adversely impacted by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the termination of the company s accounts receivable securitization program 
dollars in millions cash used for provided by investing activities   in  cash was used for investing activities totaling million compared to investing activities that provided cash of billion in the primary difference was related to proceeds from the sale of assets  which were million in compared to  million in  the latter related principally to the sale of invista see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in  the settlement of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company s net exposure  by currency  related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the receipt of million versus cash payments of million in the cash inflow in was primarily related to the stronger usd while the payments in were primarily attributable to the weaker usd 
these settlements were largely offset by revaluations of the items being hedged  which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
purchases of plant  property and equipment in totaled billion  including million to replace plant assets destroyed by the hurricanes 
cash flows totaling billion were provided by investing activities in as compared to cash used for investing activities in in  proceeds from the sale of invista were  million 
these proceeds were partly offset by cash payments associated with the settlement of forward currency exchange contracts of million and purchases of plant  property and equipment of billion 
payments for businesses acquired in totaled billion  primarily consisting of two acquisitions 
in june and july  the company acquired  shares in dupont canada from the minority owners for billion 
in may  the solae company  a majority owned subsidiary of the company  acquired percent of bunge limited s brazilian ingredients operation for million  with the additional percent acquired in the fourth quarter of for million 
in addition  in  payments associated with the settlement of foreign exchange contracts were million and purchases of plant  property and equipment were billion including million of synthetic leases 
the company expects purchases of plant  property and equipment to be between and billion  which includes million for hurricane related capital expenditures 
dollars in millions cash used for provided by financing activities   changes in cash flows related to financing activities are principally related to the company s use of commercial paper and debt  the payment of dividends and share repurchase activity 
total debt at december   was billion  an increase of billion from december   primarily due to new borrowings to support the ajca cash repatriation program and the billion contribution to the principal us pension plan  partially offset by repayments 
total debt at december  was billion  a decrease of billion from december   primarily due to the use of proceeds from the sale of invista to pay down commercial paper 
also  million of the company s debt was assumed by koch in the sale of invista 
at december  the company s commercial paper balance was  million  and billion for  and  respectively 
in addition to changes in the level of debt  the mix of the company s debt also changed 
commercial paper decreased billion in over and in the company issued billion of six and ten year notes 
these notes essentially refinanced the billion of maturing long term notes due in and extended the company s maturity profile 
dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were billion in   and dividends per share of common stock were in and in both and the common dividend declared in the first quarter was the company s th consecutive dividend since the company s first dividend in the fourth quarter the company s board of directors authorized a billion share buyback plan in june during  the company purchased million shares at a cost of million against this program  bringing the cumulative purchases against this program to million shares at a cost of million 
management expects to continue purchasing stock under this buyback plan to offset dilution from shares issued under employee compensation plans 
however  management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining stock under this program 
in addition to the plan  in october the board of directors authorized a billion share buyback plan 
on october   the company repurchased million shares of dupont s outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion from goldman sachs under an accelerated share repurchase agreement  which is discussed in certain derivative instruments under off balance sheet arrangements 
the company intends to execute the remaining billion repurchase over the months following the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program in mid  consistent with the company s cash discipline policy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of shares activity 
in  the company redeemed two minority interest structures for billion and recorded a charge of million primarily to write off the remaining unamortized costs associated with the transactions 
these structures had been established in and the associated costs were being amortized on a straight line basis over a five year period 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities cash and cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities totaled billion  billion  and billion at december    and  respectively 
the billion decrease in cash from to was due mainly to the billion share buyback and debt pay down partially offset by new borrowings to fund the repatriation of billion under ajca and positive net cash flow in several regions 
the million increase in cash from to was due mainly to proceeds from sale of invista almost entirely offset by debt repayments 
net debt at december   net debt was billion compared to billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
the company defines net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
management believes that net debt is meaningful because it provides the investor with a more holistic view of the company s liquidity and debt position since the company s cash balance is available to meet operating and capital needs  as well as to provide liquidity around the world 
net debt also allows the investor to more easily compare cash flow between periods without adjusting for changes in cash and debt 
the following table reconciles the differences from total debt to net debt dollars in millions december  commercial paper  long term debt due in one year  other short term debt total short term debt   long term debt    borrowings and capital leases held for sale total debt    cash and cash equivalents held for sale cash and cash equivalents    marketable debt securities net debt    the following table summarizes changes in net debt throughout  and dollars in millions december  net debt beginning of year    cash provided by continuing operations    purchases of property  plant equipment and investments in affiliates net payments for businesses acquired  proceeds from sales of assets proceeds from sale of assets textiles interiors  net of cash sold debt assumed by koch forward exchange contract settlements dividends paid to stockholders    acquisition of treasury stock  redemption of corporate minority interest structures  effect of exchange rate changes on cash other increase decrease in net debt    net debt end of year    off balance sheet arrangements certain guarantee contracts indemnifications the company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures  and related business activities prior to the completion of the transactions 
the terms of these indemnifications  which typically pertain to environmental  tax and product liabilities  are generally indefinite 
in addition  the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law  against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company  such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters 
if the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim  pursuant to the terms of the indemnification  the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party 
the maximum amount of potential future payments is generally indeterminable 
the carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of december  and is million and million  respectively 
although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued  due to the nature of indemnified items  it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss 
no assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist 
in connection with the sale of invista  the company indemnified koch against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes  legal and environmental matters  and other representations and warranties 
the estimated fair value of these obligations of million is included in the indemnifications balance of million at december  the fair value was based on management s best estimate of the value expected to be required to issue the indemnifications in a stand alone  arm s length transaction with an unrelated party and  where appropriate  by the utilization of probability weighted discounted net cash flow models 
the company does not believe that these indemnities will have a material impact on the future liquidity of the company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
obligations for equity affiliates and others the company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates  customers  suppliers and other unaffiliated companies 
at december   the company had directly guaranteed million of such obligations  plus million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries and affiliates 
this represents the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees 
the company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party 
no material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees 
at december   the liabilities recorded for these obligations were not material 
existing guarantees for customers and suppliers arose as part of contractual agreements 
existing guarantees for equity affiliates arose for liquidity needs in normal operations 
in certain cases  the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers 
the company has historically guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities related to divested subsidiaries including conoco and its subsidiaries and affiliates  invista entities sold to koch  and consolidation coal sales company 
the restructuring  transfer and separation agreement between dupont and conoco requires conoco to use its best efforts to have conoco  or any of its subsidiaries  substitute for dupont 
conoco  koch and consolidation coal sales company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees 
no material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees 
at december   the company has no liabilities recorded for these obligations 
additional information with respect to the company s guarantees is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations  however  the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees should unforeseen circumstances arise 
certain derivative instruments during  the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with goldman  sachs co 
goldman sachs under which the company agreed to repurchase from goldman sachs shares of dupont s outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  million 
under the agreement  the company purchased and retired  shares of dupont s common stock on october   at a price per share of with goldman sachs purchasing an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the nine month period ending july  at the end of the nine month period  the company may receive from  or be required to pay to  goldman sachs a price adjustment that may be settled  at the company s option  in cash or shares of its common stock 
the price adjustment is based upon the difference between the volume weighted average price vwap of dupont common stock during the nine month purchase period and  multiplied by the number of shares purchased by goldman sachs 
if the vwap is less than  then goldman sachs will owe an adjustment to the company  conversely if the vwap exceeds  the company will owe goldman sachs 
through december   goldman sachs had purchased  shares with a vwap of 
if goldman sachs purchased the remaining  shares at the december  closing price of  then the company would owe goldman sachs a price adjustment of million upon settlement  payable in cash or shares of the company s common stock 
the repurchase agreement caps the number of shares that could be required to be issued at  the forward contract for the price adjustment is accounted for as an equity instrument and changes in its fair value are not recorded during the contract period 
upon settlement in cash or shares  the price adjustment will be recorded as equity 
synthetic leases at december   the company has one synthetic lease program relating to miscellaneous short lived equipment valued at approximately million 
lease payments for these assets totaled million in  million in and million in  and were reported as operating expenses in the consolidated income statement 
the leases under this program are considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
furthermore  the lease payments associated with this program vary based on one month libor 
the company may terminate the program at any time by purchasing the assets 
should the company decide neither to renew the leases nor to exercise its purchase option  it must pay the owner a residual value guarantee amount  which may be recovered from a sale of the property to a third party 
residual value guarantees totaled million at december  during  the company purchased the assets under its synthetic leases related to manufacturing and warehousing facilities under construction for million 
contractual obligations information related to the company s significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table dollars in millions payments due in total at december  and beyond long term and short term debt    capital leases operating leases purchase obligations information technology infrastructure services raw material obligations research development agreements utility obligations invista related obligations human resource services other total purchase obligations  other long term liabilities  workers compensation asset retirement obligations environmental remediation legal settlements other total other long term liabilities total contractual obligations     included in the consolidated financial statements 
represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the agreement 
includes raw material supply obligations of million and contract manufacturing obligations of million 
primarily represents obligations associated with distribution  health care benefit administration  and other professional and consulting contracts 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within long term employee benefits 
primarily represents employee related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations should unforeseen circumstances arise 
long term employee benefits the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees 
the company maintains retirement related programs in many countries that have a long term impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans  and medical  dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors 
about percent of the company s worldwide benefit obligation for pensions  and essentially all of the company s worldwide benefit obligation for retiree medical  dental and life insurance benefits are attributable to the benefit plans covering substantially all us employees 
where permitted by applicable law  the company reserves the right to change  modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension and medical  dental and life insurance benefits 
benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement 
pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
unless required by law  the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits 
the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits 
by law  no contributions are currently required to be made to the principal us pension plan in and no contributions are currently anticipated 
the company will monitor the pension funding legislation in the us  but the company does not anticipate it will have a material near term impact on required or voluntary contributions 
contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
us pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows 
pension coverage for employees of the company s non us consolidated subsidiaries is provided  to the extent deemed appropriate  through separate plans 
funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates 
thus  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense 
in general  however  reduced asset valuations tend to result in higher contributions to pension plans 
in  the company contributed  million to its pension plans  including  million to its principal us pension plan 
the company anticipates that it will make approximately million in contributions in to pension plans other than the principal us pension plan 
gaap requires the full reflection of the amount of pension under funding  if any  defined as the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the amount of pension assets as of the measurement date 
to the extent this amount has not already been fully reflected  the company is required to reflect an additional minimum pension liability  and any adjustment is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
for this purpose  each of the company s pension plans must be tested individually 
at year end  a non cash after tax charge of billion to stockholders equity was recorded in response to lower asset valuations and somewhat higher benefit obligations as of that date 
in  and  million   million and million  respectively  of this charge was reversed  reflecting the net effect of recovering asset values  company contributions  and changes in discount rates 
medical  dental and life insurance plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows 
pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
this amount is expected to be about million in changes in cash requirements during this period reflect higher per capita health care costs  demographic changes  and changes in participant premiums  co pays and deductibles 
in addition  lower cash requirements for reflect the commencement of the government sponsored prescription drug coverage under the us medical program 
the company s income can be significantly affected by pension benefits as well as retiree medical  dental and life insurance benefits 
the following table summarizes the extent to which the company s income over each of the last three years was affected by pretax charges and credits related to long term employee benefits 
pretax dollars in millions pension charges other postretirement benefit charges credits net charge the decrease in pension cost is primarily attributable to the absence of million net settlement and curtailment charges recorded in in connection with the sale of invista 
in addition  the lower expense in reflects favorable returns on pension assets  higher contributions to pension plans and changes in discount rates 
the increase in other benefit expenses principally reflects the absence of million curtailment gains recognized in in connection with the sale of invista 
the company s key assumptions used in calculating its long term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increases  and the discount rate see note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective for the consolidated financial statements  the company updated the mortality tables used for most us plans 
the impact of the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates were more than offset by the effects of favorable investment and other economic experience under these plans 
for  these factors are expected to result in a reduction in pension and other postretirement benefit pretax expenses of about million 
environmental matters dupont operates global manufacturing facilities  product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations 
company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  dupont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions  eliminate the generation of hazardous waste  decrease the volume of waste water discharges  increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent  bioaccumulative and toxic materials 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations  as well as internal voluntary programs and goals  are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
pretax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled million in compared with million in and million in these expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below  operating  maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste  air and water pollution control facilities  and the costs of environmental research activities 
while expenses related to the costs of environmental research activities are not a significant component of the company s overall environmental expenses  the company expects these costs to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development 
the largest of the environmental expenses in was million for the operation of water pollution control facilities and million for solid waste management 
about percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from operations in the us in  dupont spent approximately million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company s internal environmental goals 
the company currently estimates expenditures for environmental related capital projects will total million in in the us  significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment  storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the caa 
until all caa regulatory requirements are established and known  considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures 
total caa capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from million to million 
the epa challenged the us chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly  high production volume hpv chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available 
an hpv chemical is a chemical listed on the inventory update rule with annual us cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more 
since  the company has spent an estimated million on hpv testing and estimates it will spend another million to complete the original hpv testing program 
an extended hpv program has been initiated by the american chemistry council in which dupont has agreed to sponsor an additional eleven new hpv chemicals listed on the inventory update rule 
since  the entire chemical industry has spent an estimated million on hpv testing 
global climate change is being addressed by the united nations framework convention on climate change the convention adopted in the kyoto protocol the protocol  adopted in december  is an effort to establish short term actions under the convention 
the protocol entered into force in february in most countries in which dupont operates 
the us has declined to ratify the protocol 
the european union eu has already begun a program to reduce emissions that includes an emissions trading system linked to the protocol 
the us continues to pursue a less restrictive climate policy framework  emphasizing voluntary action 
the protocol establishes significant emission reduction targets for six gases considered to have global warming potential and is driving mandatory reductions in developed nations outside the us dupont has a stake in a number of these gases co  hfcs and pfcs and has been reducing its emissions of these gases since dupont remains well ahead of the target and timetable of the protocol 
however  the company faces the possibility of country specific restrictions in several countries where major reductions have not yet been achieved 
high energy prices in europe and the us in recent years are also due  at least in part  to expectations of emission reduction mandates and the impact of european climate change policies 
dupont is participating in emissions trading in the eu and elsewhere that could aid in satisfying such country specific requirements 
emission reduction mandates within the us are not expected in the near future  although congressional proposals for such mandates have been introduced and a number of states are pursuing state level programs 
dupont has discovered that very low levels of dioxins parts per trillion to low parts per billion and related compounds are inadvertently generated during its titanium dioxide pigment production process 
the company has launched an extensive research and process engineering development program to identify the cause of the dioxin generation and to identify process modifications that will eliminate dioxin formation 
the programs implemented to date have resulted in reductions of almost percent  significant progress against dupont s aggressive goals to reduce such dioxin generation by percent by over percent of the dioxin generated at dupont s production plants becomes associated with process solid wastes that are disposed in controlled landfills where public exposure is negligible 
remediation expenditures the rcra extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous waste 
rcra requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility 
if conditions warrant  companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations 
in contrast to cercla  the costs of the rcra corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company 
the company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required over the next two decades 
annual expenditures for the near term  however  are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years 
longer term  expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 
the company s expenditures associated with rcra and similar remediation activities were approximately million in  million in  and million in the company  from time to time  receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a prp under cercla or similar state statutes 
cercla is often referred to as the superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted operations or where company generated waste has been disposed 
the company has also  on occasion  been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties 
these requests  notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned  but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company s past operations 
as of december   the company had been notified of potential liability under cercla or state laws at sites around the us  with active remediation under way at of these sites 
in addition  the company has resolved its liability at sites  either by completing remedial actions with other prps or by participating in de minimis buyouts with other prps whose waste  like the company s  represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site 
the company received notice of potential liability at new sites during compared with four similar notices in  and five in the company s expenditures associated with cercla and similar state remediation activities were approximately million in  million in  and million in for nearly all superfund sites  the company s potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other prps is relatively low 
other prps at sites where the company is a party typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and  where they do not  or where prps cannot be located  the company s own share of liability has not materially increased 
there are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant  and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites  and at all cercla sites in the aggregate  is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position  liquidity or results of operations of the company 
total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under cercla  rcra and similar state laws were million in  million in  and million in remediation accruals at december   the consolidated balance sheets included an accrued liability of million compared to million at year end considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and  under adverse changes in circumstances  potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of december  of the million accrued liability  approximately percent was reserved for non us facilities 
approximately percent of the reserve balance was attributable to rcra and similar remediation liabilities  while percent was attributable to cercla liabilities 
remediation accruals of million  million and million were added to the reserve in  and  respectively 
in  nearly million of remediation liabilities were transferred to koch as part of the sale of invista 
pfoa dupont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers  marketing many of them under the teflon and zonyl brands 
the fluoropolymer resin and dispersion businesses are part of the electronic communication technologies segment  the fluorotelomers business is part of the safety protection segment 
fluoropolymer resins and dispersions are high performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics  telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation  automotive fuel systems  computer chip processing equipment  weather resistant breathable apparel and nonstick cookware 
fluorotelomers are used to make soil  stain and grease repellants for paper  apparel  upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings 
a form of pfoa is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions 
for over years  dupont purchased its pfoa needs from a third party  but beginning in the fall of  it began producing pfoa to support the manufacture of fluorpolymer resins and dispersions 
pfoa is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers  however  it is an unintended by product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer based products 
dupont performance elastomers  llc uses pfoa in its manufacture of kalrez perfluoroelastomer parts and certain fluoroelastomers marketed under the viton trademark 
as a result of a series of agreements with dow  dupont became the sole owner of dupont dow elastomers  llc on june  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the wholly owned subsidiary has been renamed dupont performance elastomers  llc and is a part of the performance materials segment 
pfoa is bio persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population 
as a result  the epa initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of pfoa in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to pfoa is occurring 
in  the epa issued a preliminary risk assessment on pfoa that focuses on the exposure of the us general population to pfoa and possible health effects  including developmental toxicity concerns 
on january   the epa issued a draft risk assessment on pfoa 
the draft stated that cancer data for pfoa may be best described as suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity  but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential under the epa s guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment 
under the guidelines  the descriptor suggestive is typically applied to agents if animal testing finds any evidence that exposure causes tumors in one species of animal 
the epa requested that the science advisory board sab review and comment on the scientific soundness of this assessment 
on january   the sab issued a draft report that disagreed with the epa s draft risk assessment which had described the cancer data as suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity 
the predominant sab view was that the experimental weight of evidence regarding human carcinogenic potential of pfoa was more consistent with the epa s descriptor of likely to be carcinogenic as defined in the guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment 
under the guidelines this description is typically applied to agents that have tested positive in more than one species  sex  strain  site or exposure route with or without evidence of carcinogenicity in humans 
a few sab members did not find the weight of evidence sufficient to support the likely descriptor and agreed with epa s suggestive descriptor 
dupont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the sab draft report because it is based on laboratory studies in rats  and does not adequately reflect human health data which to date demonstrates no increase in cancer rates known to be associated with pfoa 
the epa has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with pfoa 
the epa has also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any consumer or industrial related products that contain pfoa 
currently  pfoa is not regulated by the epa and there are no regulatory actions pending that would prohibit its production or use 
however  there can be no assurance that the epa or any other regulatory entity will not in the future choose to regulate or prohibit the production or use of pfoa 
products currently manufactured by the company representing approximately billion of revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition 
dupont respects the epa s position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of pfoa and dupont  as well as other companies  have outlined plans for continued research  emission reduction activities  and product stewardship activities to help address the epa s questions 
in january  dupont pledged its commitment to the epa s pfoa stewardship program 
the epa program asks participants to commit to achieve  no later than  a percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of pfoa  pfoa precursors  and related higher homologue chemicals and to commit to working toward the elimination of pfoa  pfoa precursors  and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than key elements of the dupont commitment to epa include reducing global emissions from manufacturing facilities by percent by which incorporates the substantial achievement of percent reduction already realized through dupont s ongoing reduction program  establishing emission caps for us facilities to limit the absolute number of pounds of pfoa emitted  implementing product caps for pfoa in fluoropolymer dispersions by  and  by  reducing pfoa content and any residual impurities in fluorotelomer products that could break down to pfoa 
in addition  dupont will work individually and with others in the industry to inform epa s regulatory counterparts in the european union  canada  china and japan about these activities and pfoa in general  including emissions reductions from dupont s facilities as well as reformulation of the company s fluoropolymer dispersions 
dupont has developed technology that can reduce the pfoa content in fluoropolymer dispersions by percent 
dupont is offering the technology to fluoropolymer manufacturers globally on a royalty free basis 
based on existing scientific data  dupont believes that pfoa exposure at the levels observed does not pose any health risk to the general public 
to date no human health effects are known to be caused by pfoa  even in workers who have significantly higher exposure levels than the general population 
dupont is conducting a two phase employee health study on pfoa for more than  workers at its washington works site located near parkersburg  w 
va 
results from the first phase of this study indicate no association between exposure to pfoa and most of the health parameters that were measured 
the only potentially relevant association is a modest increase in some  but not all  lipid fractions  eg cholesterol  in some of the highest exposed workers 
it is unclear if this association is caused by pfoa exposure or is related to some other variable  therefore  dupont is consulting with medical and other scientific experts to design and conduct appropriate follow up testing 
the second phase is a mortality study that involves the examination of all causes of death in employees who worked at the washington works site during its more than fifty years of operation 
dupont has established reserves in connection with certain pfoa litigation matters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments derivatives and other hedging instruments under procedures and controls established by the company s financial risk management framework  the company enters into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price risks 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions  petrochemical and petroleum companies  and exchanges 
the company hedges certain business specific foreign currency exposures as well as foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
in addition  the company enters into exchange traded agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge exposures relevant to agricultural feedstock purchases 
in january  the company terminated its broad based foreign currency revenue hedging program  as well as its program to hedge natural gas purchases 
all outstanding foreign currency and natural gas hedging positions related to these programs expired during in october  the company authorized the use of financial derivatives to hedge exposure to price fluctuations for certain energy feedstock purchases 
however  at december   the company had not entered into any derivative instruments with respect to this program 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash  investments  accounts receivable and derivatives 
as part of the company s risk management processes  it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service dupont  and monitors actual exposures versus established limits on a daily basis 
the company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions 
the company maintains cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  derivatives  and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions 
these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed  and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 
the company s sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers 
as of december   no one individual customer balance represents more than percent of the company s total outstanding receivables balance 
credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic  industry and customer diversity associated with the company s global businesses 
the company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit 
as a result  it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances 
length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region 
foreign currency risk the company s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and cash flows 
the company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations 
the primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized 
the following table summarizes the impacts of this program on the company s results of operations for the years ended december   and dollars in millions pretax exchange gain loss tax expense benefit after tax loss this table includes the company s pro rata share of its equity affiliates exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on forward exchange contracts 
in addition  option and forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion of certain anticipated foreign currency raw material purchases from vendors outside of the us gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the related foreign currency denominated costs 
from time to time  the company will enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the usd amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case by case basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure  market volatility and economic trends 
forward exchange contracts are also used  from time to time  to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements and to place foreign currency deposits and marketable securities investments 
interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on three or six month usd libor 
interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt 
commodity price risk the company enters into over the counter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases 
the company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory 
under these contracts  growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain for a period of time following harvest 
derivative instruments  such as commodity futures that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity  are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers 
the company utilizes agricultural commodity futures to manage the price volatility of soybean meal 
these derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk 
additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
value at risk a value at risk var analysis provides a forward looking perspective of the maximum potential loss in fair value for a defined period of time assuming normal market conditions and a given confidence level 
the company s risk management portfolio consists of a variety of hedging instruments which provide protection from volatility in the areas of interest rates  foreign currency  agricultural commodities  and energy feedstock commodities 
the valuations and risk calculations for the var analysis were conducted using the company s risk management portfolios as of december   and the average  high and low values reflected in the table were developed from each of the four quarters ended in the var analysis used a monte carlo simulation type model with a covariance matrix  and employed  pseudo random market paths including all risk factors associated with the hedging instruments in the company s risk management portfolios 
the calculations were conducted over a business day period at a percent confidence level 
the following table details the results of the var analysis for each significant risk management portfolio at the end of both and var for the entire risk management portfolio is a loss of million for  and a loss of million for  these values reflect the diversification benefits and covariance correlation of the total portfolio 
dollars in millions average high low foreign currency interest rates agricultural commodities the table above represents the var potential loss in fair value when each risk management portfolio is valued individually 
the changes in portfolio vars in as compared to are due to changes in portfolio size  price volatility and  for interest rates  higher short term rates and a flatter yield curve 
the var model results are only an estimate and are not intended to forecast actual losses that may be incurred in future periods 
since the company s risk management programs are highly effective  the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposures
