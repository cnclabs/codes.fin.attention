critical accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  contained elsewhere in this report  includes a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policy  with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses  involve a high degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often requires assumptions or estimates about uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially 
this critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed by central jersey bancorp s audit committee and board of directors 
additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments  including goodwill  investment securities and deferred tax assets 
central jersey bancorp performs an annual analysis to test the aggregate balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for purposes of goodwill impairment evaluation  central jersey bancorp is identified as the reporting unit 
fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination and uses standard valuation methodologies including a review of comparable transactions 
if the carrying amount of goodwill pursuant to this analysis were to exceed the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized 
no impairment loss was required to be recognized for the year ended december  for the year ended december   central jersey bancorp recorded million of goodwill related to the combination with allaire community bank 
central jersey bancorp s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
estimated fair values are based on published or securities dealers market prices 
securities which central jersey bancorp has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
central jersey bancorp conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other than temporary 
if such a decline were deemed other than temporary  central jersey bancorp would write down the security to fair value through a charge to current period operations 
the market value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities increases 
with significant changes in interest rates  central jersey bancorp evaluates its intent and ability to hold securities to maturity or for a sufficient amount of time to recover the recorded principal balance 
the determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income 
such estimates are subject to management s judgment 
a valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items

the basic objectives of the investment function are o to keep central jersey bank  na s funds fully employed at the maximum after tax return  o to minimize exposure to credit risk  and o to provide liquidity required by current circumstances 
as used in our investment policy and in other policies of central jersey bank  na  the term liquidity refers to the expected cash flow from performing assets and secondary to borrowings secured by performing assets 
these two sources of liquidity are expected to fund the operations of central jersey bank  na for this reason  unless otherwise indicated  the term liquidity in central jersey bank  na s policies does not refer to proceeds from the sale of assets  except for the sale of assets available for sale 
investment management therefore emphasizes o preservation of principal  o strong cash flow characteristics  o ready availability of credit information  o appropriateness of size both as to central jersey bank  na and as to an obligor s outstanding debt  o eligibility as collateral for public agency deposits and customer repurchase agreement accounts  and o broad marketability  as an indicator of quality 
the purpose of bonds in the held to maturity portfolio is to provide earnings consistent with the safety factors of quality  maturity and risk diversification 
this purpose is reflected in the accounting principle that carrying a debt security at amortized cost is appropriate only if the investment committee of central jersey bank  na has the intent and ability to hold that security to maturity 
management should be indifferent to price fluctuations unrelated to the continuing ability of a security to contribute to recurring income 
for purposes of our investment policy  a security shall be deemed to have matured if it is sold within months of maturity or a call date if exercise of the call is probable  or after collection of at least of the principal outstanding at acquisition 
debt securities that are not positively expected to be held to maturity  but rather for indefinite periods of time  and equity securities  shall be booked to the available for sale portfolio  which shall be monitored daily and reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a tax effected net amount in a separate component of shareholders equity 
however  in calculating and reporting regulatory capital  only net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities is deducted from tier or core capital 
loan portfolio central jersey bank  na s primary policy goal is to establish a sound credit portfolio that contributes  in combination with other earning assets  to a satisfactory return on assets  return on shareholders equity and capital to asset ratio 
central jersey bank  na conducts both commercial and retail lending activities 
the loan approval process at central jersey bank  na is driven by the aggregate indebtedness of the borrower and related entities 
executive officers with lending authority and loan officers have various individual and collective loan approval authorities up to  this lending limit was increased from  to  on january   the effective date of the combination of central jersey bancorp and allaire community bank 
all credit accommodations exceeding  are referred to central jersey bank  na s loan committee for review and approval 
the loan committee is comprised of internal and outside directors 
a loan officer with a loan application for more than  or from a borrowing relationship with aggregate debt in excess of  presents a complete analysis of the proposed credit accommodation to the members of the loan committee for their consideration 
the analysis includes  among other things  the following o a description of the borrower  o the loan purpose and use of proceeds  o the requested loan amount  o the recommended term  o the recommended interest rate  o primary  secondary and tertiary sources of repayment  o proposed risk rating  o full collateral description  o fees if any  o full borrower financial analysis  including comparative balance sheets  income statements and statements of cash flows  and o inherent strengths and weaknesses of the requested credit accommodation 
a similar analysis is prepared for those loan requests aggregating in excess of  but less than the  threshold 
central jersey bank  na utilizes a comprehensive approach to loan underwriting 
the primary quantitative determinants in the underwriting process include overall creditworthiness of the borrower  cash flow from operations in relation to debt service requirements and the ability to secure the credit accommodation with collateral of adequate value 
for commercial loans  the collateral is somewhat dependent on the loan type 
commercial lines of credit  term loans and time notes are typically secured by a general lien on business assets and qualified typically less than days accounts receivable based upon an acceptable advance rate 
commercial mortgage loans are secured by the underlying property with an acceptable equity margin 
personal guarantees from the principals of a business are generally required 
in general  central jersey bank  na requires that income available to service debt repayment requirements be equal to at least of those requirements 
commercial loans are often subject to cyclical economic risks of the underlying business s of the borrower 
such risks are generally reduced during the loan approval process 
for example  central jersey bank  na requires that a loan amount be less than the value of the collateral securing the loan and that the standard cash flow analysis of the commercial borrower shows an ample margin for debt service even with significant business contraction 
commercial mortgage underwriting also requires that available funds for debt service exceed debt service requirements 
retail or consumer loan credit accommodations include home equity loans  home equity lines of credit  direct automobile loans and secured and unsecured personal loans 
underwriting criteria for home equity products include a loan to value not to exceed and a debt service to income ratio not to exceed 
such criteria provide central jersey bank  na with underwriting comfort without placing the institution in a position of competitive disadvantage 
there are a number of risks associated with the granting of consumer loans 
while income and equity or collateral values are primary determinants of the loan approval process for consumer loans  central jersey bank  na also gives much consideration to employment and debt payment history of the borrower s 
as with the commercial underwriting process  consumer loans require both an income cushion and a collateral cushion 
such criteria provide for a margin should a borrower s income diminish or the collateral securing the loan depreciate in value 
the granting of a loan  by definition  contains inherent risks 
central jersey bank  na attempts to mitigate risks through sound credit underwriting 
each loan that central jersey bank  na approves undergoes credit scrutiny that results in a quantification of risk and then the assignment of a risk rating 
individual risk ratings carry with them a required reserve that is used to fund central jersey bank  na s allowance for loan losses 
the inherent risk associated with each loan is a function of loan type  collateral  cash flow  credit rating  general economic conditions and interest rates 
central jersey bank  na is limited by regulation as to the total amount which may be committed and loaned to a borrower and its related entities 
central jersey bank  na s legal lending limit is equal to of its capital funds  including capital stock  surplus  retained earnings and the allowance for loan losses 
central jersey bank  na may lend an additional of its capital funds to a borrower and its related entities if the additional loan or extension of credit is fully secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value at least equal to the amount borrowed 
the additional limitation is separate from  and in addition to  the general limitation of

a loan  which is past due ninety days or more and still accruing interest  remains on accrual status only where it is both adequately secured as to principal and is in the process of collection 
central jersey bank  na had non performing loans totaling thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 
potential problem loans in addition to non performing loans  central jersey bank  na maintains a watch list of loans which are subject to heightened scrutiny and more frequent review by management 
loans may be placed on the watch list because of documentation deficiencies  or because management has identified structural weaknesses which potentially could cause such loans to become non performing in future periods 
as of december  and  there were no loans identified as having structural weaknesses on the watch list 
the total balance of loans on the watch list at december  and was million and million  respectively 
allowance for loan losses and related provision the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or expected on extension of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of central jersey bank  na  due to the inherently subjective nature of the evaluation 
credit losses primarily arise from central jersey bank  na s loan portfolio  but also may be derived from other credit related sources  including commitments to extend credit 
additions are made to the allowance through periodic provisions which are charged to expense 
all losses of principal are charged to the allowance when incurred or when a determination is made that a loss is expected 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
as part of our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  each quarter we prepare an analysis 
this analysis categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type commercial  commercial real estate  one to four family  consumer  etc 
and loan risk rating 
loan risk ratings for every loan are determined by credit officers who consider various factors including the borrower s current financial condition and payment status  historical loan performance  underlying collateral  as well as internal loan review and regulatory ratings 
any loans with known potential losses are categorized and reserved for separately 
the loss factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature  and  in central jersey bank  na s circumstances  even more so due to the lack of any meaningful charge off experience 
loss factors are assigned to loan risk rating categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
key factors we consider in determining loss factors for each loan type include the current real estate market conditions  changes in the trend of delinquencies and non performing loans  the current state of the local and national economy  loan portfolio growth and changes in composition and concentrations within the portfolio 
the loss factors are evaluated by management on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are approved by the board of directors of central jersey bancorp 
there have been no significant changes in loss factors in as compared to we establish the provision for loan losses after considering the allowance for loan loss worksheet  the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance  loan portfolio growth  loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis 
central jersey bank  na s allowance for loan losses is allocated on an individual loan basis and central jersey bank  na does not maintain an unallocated allowance for loan losses 
we have applied this process consistently and have made minimal changes in the estimation methods and assumptions that we have used 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  and to a lesser extent  home equity and second mortgages 
as a result of our strategic plans and lending emphasis  we have a loan concentration in commercial loans at december  and  the majority of which are secured by real property located in new jersey 
based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio over the past five years  we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are possible increases in interest rates  a possible decline in the economy  generally  and a possible decline in real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies and loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was thousand for  as compared to thousand for the provision was required based upon credit characteristics of the net loan growth for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses of thousand for the year ended december  was in response to net loan growth of during such period 
there were no significant changes in loan portfolio composition  asset quality  or credit delinquencies that impacted the allowance for loan losses during the year ended december   as compared to loan portfolio composition remained consistent in  as compared to  with commercial loans comprising of total loans outstanding at december  and in addition  central jersey bank  na had non accrual or impaired loans totaling thousand at december  as compared to thousand at december  gross loans outstanding totaled million at december   as compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million  or by  at december   from the million at december   due primarily to the combination with allaire community bank

an important component of a bank s asset and liability management structure is the level of liquidity  which are net liquid assets available to meet the needs of its customers and regulatory requirements 
during the past two years  the liquidity needs of central jersey bank  na were primarily met by cash on hand  loan and investment amortizations and borrowings 
central jersey bank  na invests funds not needed for operations excess liquidity primarily in daily federal funds sold 
with adequate cash inflows resulting from deposits during the years and  central jersey bank  na maintained levels of short term assets sufficient to maintain ample liquidity 
during  central jersey bank  na continued to maintain a large secondary source of liquidity known as investment securities available for sale 
the market value of that portfolio was million at december  and million at december  it has been central jersey bank  na s experience that its core deposit base which is defined as transaction accounts and term deposits of less than  is primarily relationship driven 
non core deposits which are defined as term deposits of  or greater are much more interest rate sensitive 
in any event  adequate sources of reasonably priced on balance sheet funds  such as overnight federal funds sold  due from banks and short term investments maturing in less than one year  must be continually accessible for contingency purposes 
this is accomplished primarily by the daily monitoring of certain accounts for sufficient balances to meet future loan commitments  as well as measuring central jersey bank  na s liquidity position on a monthly basis 
supplemental sources of liquidity include large certificates of deposit  wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  and lines of credit with correspondent banks 
correspondent banks  which are typically referred to as banker s banks  offer essential services such as cash letter processing  investment services  loan participation support  wire transfer operations and other traditional banking services 
brokered deposits  which are deposits obtained  directly or indirectly  from or through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker  may be utilized as supplemental sources of liquidity in accordance with central jersey bank  na s balance sheet management policy 
contingent liquidity sources may include off balance sheet funds  such as advances from both the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank  and federal funds purchase lines with upstream correspondents 
an additional source of liquidity is made available by curtailing loan activity and instead using the available cash to fund short term investments such as overnight federal funds sold or other approved investments maturing in less than one year 
in addition  future expansion of central jersey bank  na s retail banking network will create additional sources of liquidity from new deposit customer relationships 
central jersey bank  na is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on central jersey bank  na s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  central jersey bank  na must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of central jersey bank  na s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
central jersey bank  na s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
see item business government regulation 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require central jersey bank  na to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total capital and tier capital to risk weighted assets and of tier capital to average assets leverage ratio 
as of december   central jersey bank  na met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the occ categorized central jersey bank  na as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that we believe have changed central jersey bank  na s category 
the following is a summary of central jersey bank  na s and central jersey bancorp s actual capital ratios as of december  and  compared to the minimum capital adequacy requirements and the requirements for classification as a well capitalized institution tier i tier i capital to capital to total capital to average assets ratio risk weighted risk weighted leverage ratio asset ratio asset ratio central jersey bancorp central jersey bank n

sandler o neill partners  lp acted as placement agent in connection with the offering of the trust preferred securities 
the securities issued by mcbk capital trust i are fully guaranteed by central jersey bancorp with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  redemption or repayment 
these securities have a floating interest rate equal to the three month libor plus basis points  which resets quarterly  with an initial interest rate of 
the securities mature on april  and may be called at par by central jersey bancorp any time after april  these securities were placed in a private transaction exempted from registration under the securities act 
the entire proceeds to mcbk capital trust i from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by mcbk capital trust i in order to purchase million of subordinated debentures from central jersey bancorp 
the subordinated debentures bear a variable interest rate equal to libor plus 
although the subordinated debentures are treated as debt of central jersey bancorp  they currently qualify as tier i capital investments  subject to the limitation under risk based capital guidelines of the federal reserve 
the portion of the trust preferred securities that exceeds this limitation qualifies as tier ii capital of central jersey bancorp 
at december   the million of the trust preferred securities qualified for treatment as tier i capital 
central jersey bancorp is using the proceeds it received from the subordinated debentures to support the general balance sheet growth of central jersey bancorp and to help ensure that central jersey bank  na maintains the required regulatory capital ratios 
on march   the federal reserve adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of outstanding and prospective issuances of trust preferred securities in the tier i capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter quantitative limits and qualitative standards 
the new quantitative limits become effective after a five year transition period ending march  under the final rules  trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements are limited to of all core capital elements 
amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits may be included in tier ii capital 
at december   the only restricted core capital element owned by central jersey bancorp is trust preferred securities 
based on a preliminary review of the final rule  central jersey bancorp believes that its trust preferred issues qualify as tier i capital 
however  in the event that the trust preferred issues do not qualify as tier i capital  central jersey bank  na would remain well capitalized

the primary impact of inflation on the operation of central jersey bancorp and central jersey bank  na is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  the effects of general levels of inflation are primarily reflected in the interest rate paid in liabilities and earned on interest earning assets 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
we believe that continuation of our efforts to manage the rates  liquidity and interest sensitivity of our assets and liabilities is necessary to generate an acceptable return on assets

members of the asset liability committee include central jersey bancorp s president and chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer and chief lending officer 
the asset liability committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income 
central jersey bank  na s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable core funding base by focusing on core deposit account acquisition and increasing products and services per household 
time deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were at december  compared to at december  time deposits are generally short term in nature 
as of december   of all time deposits had maturities of one year or less compared to at december  central jersey bank  na s ability to retain maturing time deposit accounts is the result of a strategy to remain competitive priced within the marketplace 
central jersey bank  na s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and central jersey bank  na s ability to fund operations through alternative sources  primarily by accessing short term lines of credit with the federal home loan bank during periods of pricing dislocation 
quantitative analysis central jersey bank  na measures sensitivity to changes in interest rates through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models 
the analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base case and rising and declining interest rate forecasts 
central jersey bank  na measures changes in net interest income for the forecast period  generally twelve to twenty four months  within set limits for acceptable change 
the following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of december  change in interest rates net interest income in basis points rate shock amount change change base case  the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate basis point parallel increase in interest rates  central jersey bank  na would experience a  or thousand  increase in net interest income
