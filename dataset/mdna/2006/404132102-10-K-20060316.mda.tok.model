item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty insurance group with offices in the united states  the united kingdom  spain  bermuda and ireland transacting business in more than countries 
our group consists of insurance companies  underwriting agencies and intermediaries 
our shares are traded on the new york stock exchange and had a market capitalization of billion at february  we earned million or per diluted share in compared to million or earned in  despite higher losses from hurricanes  a loss from a commutation in and the dilution from a million common stock offering in december we grew shareholders equity by in to billion at december   principally from a combination of net earnings and a million equity offering in november in and  the property and casualty insurance industry suffered record losses from nine major hurricanes that affected the atlantic and gulf coasts of the united states 
we estimate our gross losses were million from the hurricanes and million from the hurricanes which  after recoveries expected from our reinsurance programs  reduces our net losses to million in and million in in  we also opportunistically commuted a large block of reinsurance recoverables 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized a loss of million which is principally the discount for the time value of money on the recoverable amount 
we expect to recoup this loss over future years as we earn interest on the cash proceeds from the commutation prior to the related claims being paid 
despite the large losses from the hurricanes and the commutation  we generated a increase to a record level of net earnings in we underwrite a variety of specialty lines of business identified as diversified financial products  group life  accident and health  aviation  london market account  and other specialty lines of business 
products in each line are marketed by our insurance companies and agencies  either through a network of independent agents and brokers  or directly to customers 
with the exception of our public company directors and officers liability business  certain international aviation risks and our london market business  the majority of our business is generally lower limit  smaller premium business that is less susceptible to price competition  severity of loss or catastrophe risk 
our major insurance companies are rated aa very strong by standard poor s corporation and a superior by am best company  inc we generate our revenue from four primary sources risk bearing earned premium produced by our insurance company operations  non risk bearing fee and commission income received by our underwriting agency and intermediary operations  ceding commissions in excess of policy acquisition costs earned by our insurance company operations and investment income earned by all of our operations 
we produced billion of revenue in  an increase of over  primarily from higher net earned premium as a result of increased retentions  recent acquisitions  organic growth  increased investment income and increases in other operating income 
during the past several years  we substantially increased our shareholders equity by retaining most of our earnings and issuing additional shares of common stock 
with this additional equity  we increased the underwriting capacity of our insurance companies and made strategic acquisitions  adding new lines of business or expanding those with favorable underwriting characteristics

results of operations net earnings increased to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in net earnings in included after tax losses of million per diluted share due to the combined effects of five hurricanes and million per diluted share due to a reinsurance commutation 
earnings from continuing operations grew to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in growth in underwriting profits  net investment income and other operating income contributed to the increase in earnings 
net earnings increased to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in net earnings in included an after tax loss of million per diluted share due to the combined effects of four hurricanes 
earnings from continuing operations grew to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in growth in all segments contributed to the increase in net earnings 
net earnings in included an after tax loss of million per diluted share due to a commutation and after tax earnings from discontinued operations of million per diluted share  which included an after tax gain of million from the sale of a subsidiary 
during and  catastrophic events occurred related to three major hurricanes  katrina  rita and wilma  and two others collectively  the hurricanes and four major hurricanes  charley  frances  ivan and jeanne collectively  the hurricanes 
we recognized pre tax losses after reinsurance recoveries and including the cost of premiums to reinstate our reinsurance protection of million in and million in in our insurance company segment 
during the past three years  we reached agreements with various reinsurers to commute certain reinsurance recoverables  some of which related to our discontinued accident and health line of business 
in and  we received cash payments that were less than the related recoverables  from certain reinsurers  in consideration for discounting the recoverables and reassuming the associated loss reserves 
we recorded pre tax losses of million in and million in related to these commutations  which were included in loss and loss adjustment expense in our insurance company segment 

table of contents the following table shows the reported amounts  as well as the effect of the hurricanes and commutations on those amounts 
the impact on ceded earned premium relates to the effect of premiums to reinstate our excess of loss reinsurance  which reduced net earned premium

to determine the effect of the hurricanes and commutations  we calculated the  and net loss ratios by excluding million  million and million  respectively  of losses from the numerator of the net loss ratio and million and million of reinstatement premium from the denominator of both the net loss ratio and the expense ratio in and  respectively

table of contents total revenue increased to billion in and to billion in  driven by significant growth in net earned premium and investment income  which more than offset the expected decrease in fee and commission income in approximately of the increase in revenue and of the increase in revenue was due to the acquisition of subsidiaries 
we expect total revenue to continue to grow in gross written premium  net written premium and net earned premium are detailed below 
premium increased from organic growth  particularly in our diversified financial products line of business  acquisitions and  with respect to net premiums  from increased retentions 
see the insurance company segment section below for further discussion of the relationship and changes in premium revenue 
gross written premium net written premium net earned premium the table below shows the source of our fee and commission income 
agencies insurance companies other fee and commission income fee and commission income decreased to million in  as expected  resulting from a decrease in the level of ceded reinsurance by our insurance company subsidiaries  which resulted in reduced revenue from our reinsurance brokers and reduced ceding commissions earned by our insurance companies and underwriting agencies 
also  effective january   we consolidated the operations of our largest underwriting agency into one of our life insurance company subsidiaries 
this higher retention of our premium and the consolidation of operations resulted in increased underwriting revenue and profitability in our insurance company subsidiaries 
fee and commission income increased in  primarily due to new business from subsidiaries acquired in the sources of net investment income are detailed below 
fixed income securities short term investments other investments total investment income investment expense net investment income net investment income increased in and in these increases were primarily due to higher investment assets  which increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  and billion at december  the growth in investment assets resulted from cash flow from operations  higher retentions  commutations of reinsurance recoverables  our public offerings of common stock in and and the increase in net loss reserves particularly from our diversified financial products line of business  which generally has a longer time period between reporting and payment of claims 
additionally  average yields on our short term investments increased from in to in we continue to invest our funds primarily in fixed income securities  extending their duration to years at the end of from years and years at the end of and  respectively  and have increased the percentage of tax exempt 
table of contents municipal bonds in our investment portfolio 
we expect investment assets to continue to increase in  consistent with our anticipated growth in revenue and earnings 
if market interest rates rise  investment income will accelerate  since new funds and current maturities could be invested at higher rates 
at december   our unrealized loss on fixed income securities was million  down from an unrealized gain of million at december   due to increases in market interest rates 
the change in the unrealized gain or loss  net of the related income tax effect  is recorded in other comprehensive income 
this loss is unlikely to affect net earnings as we typically hold our fixed income securities to maturity when we receive the full principal amount 
other operating income increased million in and million in the increase related primarily to gains from strategic investments  higher gains on sales of trading securities and a million gain on the sale of a dormant subsidiary 
the increase included million income from two mortgage impairment insurance policies treated as derivatives and a million gain from the sale of a building 
period to period comparisons in this category may vary substantially depending on market values of trading securities and other financial instruments and on income from strategic investments or dispositions of such investments 
the following table details the components of other operating income 
trading securities strategic investments sale of non operating assets financial instruments other other operating income loss and loss adjustment expense increased in and in due to the and hurricane losses and the commutation  as well as growth in net retained premium in both years 
policy acquisition costs increased in and in  primarily due to the growth in net earned premium 
see the insurance company segment section below for further discussion of the changes in loss and loss adjustment expense and policy acquisition costs 
other operating expense  which includes compensation expense  increased in and in the increases primarily related to higher incentive compensation based on increased profitability  operating expenses of subsidiaries acquired or formed  and the expensing of million for an indemnification claim in and million to cover estimated settlement costs related to pending litigation in we had  employees at december   compared to  a year earlier 
the increase in employees was primarily due to acquisitions 
our effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was for  compared to for and for the effective tax rate decreased because our tax exempt interest income increased as a percentage of our pre tax income in both and  and we recorded a special million repatriation tax benefit in in december  we sold the business of our retail brokerage subsidiary  hcc employee benefits  inc  for million in cash 
we recognized a gain of million million after tax in and additional gains of million million after tax in and million million after tax in from a contractual earnout  which is now completed 
the after tax earnings from discontinued operations and the after tax gain on sale are reported as earnings from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings 
cash flows from the subsidiary s operations are included with cash flows from continuing operations within each major category of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flows from the sale and earnout are included in investing activities 

table of contents at december   book value per share was  up from at december  and at december  total assets were billion and shareholders equity was billion  up from billion and billion  respectively  at december  segments we operate our businesses in three segments insurance company  agency and other operations 
our chairman and chief executive officer  as chief decision maker  monitors and evaluates the individual financial results of each subsidiary in the insurance company and agency segments 
each subsidiary provides monthly reports of its actual and budgeted results  which are aggregated on a segment basis for management review and monitoring 
the operating results of our insurance company and agency segments are discussed below 
insurance company segment net earnings of our insurance company segment increased to million in compared to million in  which in turn increased from million in the net earnings included million of after tax losses related to hurricanes and a commutation  while net earnings included million of after tax hurricane losses and net earnings included an million after tax commutation loss 
the growth in segment net earnings was driven by improved underwriting results  increased retentions  which resulted in higher earned premium  increased investment income and the operations of acquired subsidiaries 
effective january   we consolidated the operations of our largest underwriting agency into one of our life insurance companies  which reduced fee and commission income of our agency segment but increased the underwriting profitability of our insurance company segment 
even though there is some pricing competition in certain of our markets  our margins remain at an acceptable level of profitability due to our underwriting expertise and discipline 
we expect net earnings from our insurance companies to continue to grow in premium gross written premium increased to billion in and in we expect gross written premium to be relatively flat in net written premium increased to billion and net earned premium increased to billion in compared to increases of and  respectively  in these increases were primarily due to higher retention levels on most non catastrophe business  acquisitions and the mix of business due to increased premium in lines where we had greater retentions 
the overall percentage of retained premium increased to in from in and in net written and net earned premium are expected to continue to grow in the following table details premium amounts and their percentages of gross written premium

we experienced significant growth in our directors and officers liability gross written premium in in response to some increased competition and a reduction in available reinsurance at an acceptable cost  we scaled back our writing of this business in rates for the other products in this line have been relatively stable with the exception of surety for which rates have been increasing 
our professional indemnity and surety business increased in due to organic growth and acquisitions 
the growth in net written and net earned premium in both years was due to increased retentions resulting from a reduction in proportional reinsurance  some of which has been replaced by excess of loss reinsurance 
group life  accident and health profit margins remain at acceptable levels despite increased competition from the fully insured market 
we increased our retentions in and as this line of business generally is not volatile and has very little catastrophe exposure 

table of contents aviation our aviation premium retention levels were mostly unchanged in after excluding the effects of a portfolio transfer that occurred in this portfolio transfer recaptured ceded unearned premium and increased net written premium  but not gross written premium  as a result of a reduction in ceded reinsurance 
there has been increasing competition in the international aviation component of this line  but margins are still acceptable 
our domestic business is very stable 
london market account we reduced our london market account premium writings in and again in  due to more selective underwriting in response to reduced premium rates from increased competition 
premium rates have generally increased in as a result of the hurricane losses 
net written premium was reduced by million in and million in for additional excess of loss premium to reinstate catastrophe reinsurance coverage  which distorts the retention percentages 
because of the catastrophe exposure  we purchase excess of loss reinsurance at a significant cost 
since there generally is a fixed minimum cost  the retention percentage decreases as our written premium decreases 
other specialty lines we experienced organic growth in our other specialty lines of business from increased writings in several products 
the mix of products will affect the retention percentages 
rates in this line have been relatively stable 
reinsurance annually  we analyze our overall threshold for risk in each line of business based upon a number of factors including market conditions  pricing  competition and the inherent risks associated with the business type  then structure a specific reinsurance program for each of our lines of business 
based on our analysis of these factors  we may determine not to purchase reinsurance for some lines of business 
we generally purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks  to protect against catastrophe losses and volatility and to achieve a desired ratio of net written premium to policyholders surplus 
we purchase reinsurance on a proportional basis to cover loss frequency  individual risk severity and catastrophe exposure 
some of the proportional insurance agreements may have maximum loss limits  which are currently well above a combined ratio 
we also purchase reinsurance on an excess of loss basis to cover individual risk severity and catastrophe exposure 
additionally  we may obtain facultative reinsurance protection on a single risk 
the type and amount of reinsurance we purchase varies year to year based on our risk assessment  our desired retention levels based on profitability and other considerations  and the market availability of quality reinsurance at prices we consider acceptable 
our reinsurance programs renew throughout the year and  during  some of those renewals contained price increases  which were not material to our net underwriting results 
our reinsurance generally does not cover war or terrorism risks  which are excluded from most of our policies 
we decided for the underwriting year to retain more underwriting risk in certain lines of business with the intention of retaining a greater proportion of any underwriting profits 
in doing so  we will necessarily purchase less reinsurance applicable to that line or choose to restructure the applicable reinsurance programs  obtaining more excess of loss reinsurance and less proportional reinsurance  which significantly reduces the amount of ceded premium 
also  we have chosen not to purchase any reinsurance on other business where volatility or catastrophe risks are considered remote 
in our proportional reinsurance programs  we generally receive an overriding ceding commission on the premium ceded to reinsurers 
this compensates our insurance companies for the direct costs associated with the production of the business  the servicing of the business during the term of the policies ceded and the costs associated with the placement of the related reinsurance 
in addition  certain of our reinsurance treaties allow us to share in any net profits generated under such treaties with the reinsurers 
various reinsurance brokers  including subsidiaries  arrange for the placement of this proportional and other reinsurance coverage on our behalf and are compensated  directly or indirectly  by the reinsurers 
we have a reserve of million at december  for potential collectibility issues related to reinsurance recoverables  including disputed amounts and associated expenses 
while we believe the 
table of contents reserve is adequate based on information currently available  conditions may change or additional information might be obtained which may require us to change the reserve in the future 
we periodically review our financial exposure to the reinsurance market and the level of our reserve and continue to take actions in an attempt to mitigate our exposure to possible loss 
losses and loss adjustment expenses the table below shows the composition of gross incurred loss and loss adjustment expense 
amount loss ratio amount loss ratio amount loss ratio hurricanes hurricanes other reserve redundancies discontinued line of business adjustments all other gross incurred loss and loss adjustment expense gross incurred loss and loss expense adjustment our gross reserve development relating to prior year losses was million in  million in and million in we increased our gross losses related to prior accident years on certain assumed accident and health reinsurance contracts reported in our discontinued line of business by million in  million in and million in due to our processing of additional information received and our continuing evaluation of gross and net reserves related to this business 
we considered a combination of factors including the nature of the business  which is primarily excess of loss reinsurance  late reported losses by insureds  reinsureds and state guaranty associations and changes in our actuarial assumptions to reflect additional information received during the year 
the assumed accident and health business is primarily reinsurance that provides excess coverage for large losses related to workers compensation policies 
this business is slow to develop and may take as many as twenty years to pay out 
primary losses must develop first before the excess coverage attaches 
thus  the losses are reported to excess of loss reinsurers later in the life cycle of the claim 
compounding this late reporting is the fact that a number of large insurance companies that were cedants of this business failed and were taken over by state regulatory authorities in and the state guaranty associations covering these failed companies have been slow to report losses to us 
based on the higher amount of actual losses reported  we revised the expected loss ratios used in our actuarial calculations 
after consideration of all available information  we increased our gross and net reserves to amounts that management determined were appropriate to cover losses projected  given the risk inherent in this type of business 
reserves at december   although in excess of the actuarial point estimate  are within the actuarial range for this business 

table of contents the table below shows the composition of net incurred loss and loss adjustment expense 
amount loss ratio amount loss ratio amount loss ratio hurricanes hurricanes commutations discontinued line of business adjustments other reserve deficiencies redundancies all other net incurred loss and loss adjustment expense net incurred loss and loss adjustment expense the discontinued line of business and hurricane losses were substantially reinsured  therefore  the net losses are substantially less than the gross losses in each year 
our net adverse development relating to prior year losses was million in  million in and million in  including million in and million in due to commutations  which primarily affected our discontinued line of business 
the commutation losses primarily represent the discount for the time value of money on the reinsurance recoverables commuted 
we reduced our net loss reserves on the hurricanes by million in to reflect current estimates of our remaining liabilities 
in and  as a result of adverse development of certain assumed accident and health business in our discontinued line of business  we strengthened our reserves for this line to bring them above our actuarial point estimate 
see our discussion of factors that caused the deficiencies in the section covering gross losses above 
deficiencies and redundancies in reserves occur as a result of our continuing review and as losses are finally settled or claims exposures change 
we have no material exposure to environmental or asbestos losses and believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses

table of contents comments on significant changes in net loss ratios by line of business follow group life  accident and health rate pressure from competition as well as medical cost inflation have resulted in increasing loss ratios in this line of business  however our underwriting margins remain satisfactory 
aviation the hurricanes increased the net loss ratio and the hurricanes increased the net loss ratio 
the net loss ratio also includes the positive impact from the release of redundant reserves related to the hurricanes 
excluding the impact of the hurricanes  had worse than expected underwriting experience due to some unusually large international losses 
london market account the hurricanes increased the net loss ratio and the hurricanes increased the net loss ratio 
the london market account line of business can have relatively high year to year volatility due to catastrophe exposure 
other specialty lines the hurricanes increased the net loss ratio and the hurricanes increased the net loss ratio 
discontinued lines the commutation losses in and affected the net loss ratios for those years 
in addition  the and net loss ratios were impacted by loss reserve strengthening of million and million  respectively  on certain assumed accident and health reinsurance contracts 
policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  which are net of the related portion of commissions on reinsurance ceded  increased to million in from million in and million in policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net earned premium declined to in from in due to a change in the mix of business  reductions in commission rates on certain lines of business and our increased retentions  which increased our net earned premium at a higher rate than our non commission acquisition costs 
the expense ratio decreased in compared to for the same reasons 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net earned premium were in and lower than due to changes in the mix of business 
statutory regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gross written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and net written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
however  industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at and  respectively 
our property and casualty insurance companies have maintained premium to surplus ratios lower than such guidelines 
for  our statutory gross written premium to policyholders surplus was and our statutory net written premium to policyholders surplus was 
at december   each of our domestic insurance companies total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital level prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners 
agency segment revenue from our agency segment decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the consolidation of our largest underwriting agency into one of our life insurance companies effective january   less business produced in certain lines and the overall effect of ceding less reinsurance 
as a result  segment net earnings also decreased in to million from million in while these actions resulted in less fee and commission income to our agency segment  they resulted in increased insurance company revenue and net earnings 
segment revenue increased and net earnings increased in  primarily from increased new business and acquisitions 
we expect the revenue and net earnings of this segment will decline slightly in due to continuing changes in the mix of business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow we receive substantial cash from premiums  reinsurance recoverables  commutations  fee and commission income  proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and investment income 
our principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and loss adjustment expenses  premium payments to reinsurers  purchases of investments  debt service  policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  taxes and dividends 
cash provided by operating activities can fluctuate due to timing differences in the collection of premiums and reinsurance recoverables and the payment of losses and premium and reinsurance balances payable  the completion of commutations and activity in our trading portfolio 
our cash provided by operating activities has been strong in recent years due to our increasing net earnings  growth in net written premium and net loss reserves due to organic growth and increased retentions  commutations of selected reinsurance agreements and expansion of our diversified financial products line of business as a result of which we retain premium longer due to the longer duration of claims liabilities 
the components of our net operating cash flows are detailed in the following table 
net earnings change in premium  claims and other receivables  net of reinsurance  other payables and restricted cash change in unearned premium  net change in loss and loss adjustment expense payable  net of reinsurance recoverables gain on sale of subsidiaries change in trading portfolio other  net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased million in and increased million in cash received from commutations  included in cash provided by operating activities  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
excluding the commutations  cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to an increase of million in the decrease in was principally due to an increase in paid claims in as a result of payments of hurricane losses and claims related to business commuted in  the timing of receipt of premiums and payment of payables  and the effect of our trading portfolio activity 
cash flows increased in principally due to increasing retentions  the growth of our diversified financial products line of business and an increase in earnings from continuing operations  net of a million tax payment in on the gain on the sale of a subsidiary 
cash flows are expected to be strong again in investments at december   we had billion of investment assets  an increase of million from the end of the increase resulted from strong operating cash flows and our million common stock offering 
the majority of our investment assets are held by our insurance companies 
all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value 
our investment policy is determined by our board of directors and our investment and finance committee and is reviewed on a regular basis 
our policy for each of our insurance company subsidiaries must comply with applicable state and federal regulations which prescribe the type  quality and concentration of investments 
these regulations permit investments  within specified limits and subject to 
table of contents certain qualifications  in federal  state and municipal obligations  obligations of foreign countries  corporate bonds and preferred and common equity securities 
the regulations generally allow certain other types of investments subject to maximum limitations 
we engage independent investment advisors to oversee our fixed income investments and to make investment recommendations 
we invest our funds principally in highly rated fixed income securities 
our historical investment strategy is to maximize interest income and yield  rather than to maximize total return 
in accordance with our strategy  realized gains and losses from sales of investment securities are usually minimal  unless we decide to capture gains to enhance statutory capital and surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries 
although we generally intend to hold fixed income securities to maturity  we regularly re evaluate our position based on market conditions 
our portfolio turnover will fluctuate  depending upon opportunities to increase yields by replacing one security with another higher yielding security 
at december   we had cash and short term investments of million  of which million is held by our insurance companies 
we maintain cash and liquid short term instruments in our insurance companies in order to be able to fund losses of our insureds 
cash and short term investments were higher than normal at december  and due to proceeds from common stock offerings and commutations that were consummated close to each year end 
those proceeds had not yet been invested on a longer term basis

the market value of our fixed income securities is sensitive to changing interest rates 
as interest rates increase  the market value will generally decrease and as rates decrease  the market value will generally increase 
the fluctuations in market value are somewhat muted by the relatively short duration of our portfolio and our relatively high level of investments in state and municipal obligations 
during  the net pre tax unrealized gain on our fixed income securities decreased million due to market value changes 
we estimate that a increase in interest rates would decrease the market value of our fixed income securities by approximately million and a decrease would increase the market value by a like amount 
fluctuations in interest rates have a minimal effect on the value of our short term investments due to their very short maturities 
in our current position  higher interest rates would have a positive effect on net earnings 
some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of our portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the average duration of claims in many of our lines of business is relatively short and  accordingly  our investment portfolio had a relatively short duration 
in recent years we have expanded the directors and officers liability and professional indemnity components of our diversified financial products line of business  which have a longer claims duration than our other lines of business 
we are taking these changes into consideration in determining the duration of our investment portfolio 
we have also kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short in recent years when rates were very low  in expectation of higher interest rates 
we have recently extended the duration and maturities of our investments to take advantage of higher long term market interest rates 

table of contents the following table compares our insurance company subsidiaries cash and investment maturities with their estimated future claims payments at december  maturities estimated payment dates total thereafter cash and investment maturities of insurance companies estimated loss and loss adjustment expense payments  net of reinsurance estimated available cash flow as demonstrated in the above table  we maintain sufficient liquidity to pay anticipated policyholder claims on their expected payment dates 
in addition  we can use current operating cash flow to pay claims as they become due 
we manage the liquidity of our insurance company subsidiaries such that each subsidiary s anticipated claims payments will be met by its own current operating cash flows  cash  short term investments or investment maturities 
we do not foresee the need to sell securities prior to their maturity to fund claims payments  nor do we anticipate needing to use our million revolving loan facility to pay claims 
however  this credit facility can provide additional short term liquidity if an unexpected event was to occur 
contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of our total contractual cash payment obligations by estimated payment date at december  estimated payment dates total thereafter gross loss and loss adjustment expense payable diversified financial products group life  accident and health aviation london market account other specialty lines discontinued lines total loss and loss adjustment expense payable life and annuity policy benefits convertible notes convertible exchange notes other notes payable million revolving loan facility operating leases earnout liabilities indemnifications total obligations 
table of contents in preparing the previous table  we made the following estimates and assumptions 
the estimated loss and loss adjustment expense payments for future periods assume that the percentage of ultimate losses paid from one period to the next will be relatively consistent over time 
actual payments will be influenced by many factors and could vary from the estimated amounts above 
the convertible notes mature in and the convertible exchange notes mature in  but are shown in the column since they may be surrendered for cash at the option of the holders in the first quarter of because our stock traded at specified price levels in both convertible notes have various put and redemption dates as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts include interest payable in respective periods 
the purchase agreements for two of our acquisitions provide for earnout payments 
the above table includes the amounts earned in  which are payable in in conjunction with the sales of business assets and subsidiaries  we have provided indemnifications to the buyers 
certain indemnifications cover typical representations and warranties related to our responsibilities to perform under the sales contracts 
other indemnifications agree to reimburse the purchasers for taxes or erisa related amounts  if any  assessed after the sale date but related to pre sale activities 
we cannot quantify the maximum potential exposure covered by all of our indemnifications because the indemnifications cover a variety of matters  operations and scenarios 
certain of these indemnifications have no time limit 
for those with a time limit  the longest such indemnification expires on december  we accrue a loss related to our indemnifications when a valid claim is made by a buyer and we believe we have potential exposure 
we currently have several claims under indemnifications that cover certain net losses alleged to have been incurred in periods prior to our sale of certain subsidiaries or otherwise alleged to be covered under indemnification agreements related to such sales 
as of december   we have recorded a liability of million and have provided million of letters of credit to cover our obligations or anticipated payments under these indemnifications 
subsidiary dividends the principal assets of hcc are the shares of capital stock of its insurance company subsidiaries 
historically  we have not relied on dividends from our insurance companies to meet the parent holding company s obligations  which are primarily outstanding debt and debt service obligations  dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses  since we have had sufficient cash flow from our agencies and intermediaries to meet our corporate cash flow requirements 
however  as more profit is now expected to be earned in our insurance companies  we may have to partially depend on cash flow from our insurance companies in the future 
the payment of dividends by our insurance companies is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries 
hcc s direct domestic insurance company subsidiaries can pay an aggregate of million in dividends in without obtaining special permission from state regulatory authorities 
in and  one insurance company subsidiary paid hcc a dividend of million and million  respectively 
the funds were then contributed to another insurance company subsidiary 

table of contents lines of credit our million revolving loan facility allows us to borrow up to the maximum allowed by the facility on a revolving basis until the facility expires on november  the facility is collateralized in part by the pledge of our insurance companies stock and guarantees entered into by our underwriting agencies and reinsurance brokers 
the facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which we believe are typical for similar financing arrangements 
we had no borrowings under this facility at december  in  we entered into a million standby letter of credit facility  which allows us to replace a portion of our funds at lloyd s of london with standby letters of credit 
any letters of credit issued under the standby letter of credit facility will be unsecured commitments of hcc 
the standby letter of credit facility contains standard restrictive covenants  which in many cases are identical to or incorporate by reference the restrictive covenants from our revolving loan facility 
at december   certain of our subsidiaries maintained revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of million available through november  advances under the lines of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws  if any  on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short term direct cash advances 
the lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market value of up to million  the actual amount of collateral at any one time being of the aggregate amount outstanding 
interest on the lines is payable at the bank s prime rate of interest at december  for draws on the letters of credit and either prime or prime less on short term cash advances 
at december   letters of credit totaling million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of our subsidiaries  with total securities of million collateralizing the lines 
other in may  the board of directors declared a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend on our shares of common stock  payable to shareholders of record on july  the distribution of the million shares had no impact on our consolidated shareholders equity  results of operations or cash flows 
we have filed registration statements with the united states securities and exchange commission that provide a shelf registration for an aggregate of million of our securities  of which we have million available to be issued 
these securities may be debt securities  equity securities or a combination thereof 
we sold million and million shares of our common stock at prices of and per share in and  respectively  under this shelf registration 
net proceeds of million in were used to make million of capital contributions to our insurance company subsidiaries and to fund acquisitions 
we used the net proceeds of million in to make a million capital contribution to an insurance company subsidiary and million to pay down bank debt 
our debt to total capital ratio was at december  and at december  we believe that our operating cash flows  investments  revolving loan facility and shelf registration will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation our operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense are known 
although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates  for competitive reasons  such premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation 
however  because the majority of our business is comprised of lines which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event  reporting of the claims to us and the final settlement of the claims or have claims that are not significantly impacted by inflation  the effects of inflation are minimized 

table of contents a portion of our revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products that are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of healthcare costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue but also higher claim payments 
inflation also may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated  without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
we do not specifically provide for inflation when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves  although we do consider trends 
we continually review claim reserves to assess their adequacy and make necessary adjustments 
inflation can also affect interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our investments 
in addition  the interest rate payable under our revolving loan facility fluctuates with market interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings  depending on the amount borrowed on that facility 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations we underwrite risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have receivables and payables in foreign currencies and we establish and maintain loss reserves with respect to our insurance policies in their respective currencies 
our net earnings could be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations affecting these balances 
our principal area of exposure is related to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the british pound sterling  the euro and the us dollar 
we constantly monitor the balance between our receivables and payables and loss reserves to mitigate the potential exposure should an imbalance be expected to exist for other than a short period of time 
our gain loss from currency conversion was million in compared to million in and million in included in the amount was a one time gain of million from the settlement of an advance of funds to an unaffiliated entity 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions when applying our accounting policies 
the following sections provide information about our estimation processes related to certain of our critical accounting policies 
loss and loss adjustment expense our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are composed of reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported losses  less a reduction for reinsurance recoverables related to those reserves 
reserves are recorded by product line and are undiscounted  except for reserves related to acquisitions 
the process of estimating our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and is inherently uncertain 
the recorded reserves represent management s best estimate of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense by line of business 
because we provide insurance coverage in specialized lines of business that often lack statistical stability  management considers many factors  and not just the actuarial point estimates discussed below  in determining ultimate expected losses and the level of net reserves required and recorded 
to record reserves on our lines of business  we utilize expected loss ratios  which management selects based on the following information used to price the applicable policies  historical loss information where available  any public industry data for that line or similar lines of business and an assessment of current market conditions 
management also considers the point estimates and ranges calculated by our actuaries  together with input from our experienced underwriting and claims personnel 
because of the nature and complexities of the specialized types of business we insure  management may give greater weight to the expectations of our underwriting and claims personnel  who often perform a claim by claim 
table of contents review  rather than to the actuarial estimates 
however  we utilize the actuarial point and range estimates to monitor the adequacy and reasonableness of our recorded reserves 
each quarter end  management compares recorded reserves to the most recent actuarial point estimate and range for each line of business 
if the recorded reserves vary significantly from the actuarial point estimate  management determines the reasons for the variances and may adjust the reserves up or down to an amount that  in management s judgment  is adequate based on all of the facts and circumstances considered  including the actuarial point estimates 
generally  we maintain total consolidated net reserves above the total actuarial point estimate but within the actuarial range 
the table below shows our recorded net reserves at december  by line of business  the actuarial reserve point estimates  and the high and low ends of the actuarial reserve range as determined by our reserving actuaries 
recorded actuarial low end of high end of net reserves point estimate actuarial range actuarial range total net reserves individual lines of business diversified financial products group life  accident and health aviation london market account other specialty lines discontinued lines total net reserves the actuarial point estimates represent our actuaries estimate of the most likely amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the net reserves we have recorded at a particular point in time 
while  from an actuarial standpoint  a point estimate is considered the most likely amount to be paid  there is inherent uncertainty in the point estimate  and it can be thought of as the expected value in a distribution of possible reserve estimates 
the actuarial ranges represent our actuaries estimate of a likely lowest amount and highest amount that will ultimately be paid to settle the net reserves we have recorded at a particular point in time 
while there is still a possibility of ultimately paying an amount below the range or above the range  the actuarial probability is very small 
the range determinations are based on estimates and actuarial judgments and are intended to encompass reasonably likely changes in one or more of the variables that were used to determine the point estimates 
the low end of the actuarial range and the high end of the actuarial range for the total net reserves will not equal the sum of the low and high ends for the individual lines of business 
moreover  in actuarial terms  it would not be appropriate to add the ranges for each line of business to obtain a range around the total net reserves because this would not reflect the diversification effects across our various lines of business 
the diversification effects result from the fact that losses across the different lines of business are not completely correlated 
in actuarial practice  some of our lines of business are more effectively modeled by a statistical distribution that is skewed or non symmetric 
these distributions are usually skewed towards large losses  which causes the midpoint of the range to be above the actuarial point estimate or mean value of the range 
this should be kept in mind when using the midpoint as a proxy for the mean 
our assumptions  estimates and judgments can change based on new information and changes in conditions and  if they change  it will affect the determination of the range amounts 

table of contents the following table details the characteristics and major actuarial assumptions by major products within our lines of business utilized by our actuaries in the determination of actuarial point estimates and ranges 
we considered all major lines of business written by the insurance industry when determining the relative characteristics of claims duration  speed of loss reporting and reserve volatility 
other companies may classify their own insurance products in different lines of business or utilize different actuarial assumptions 
claims characteristics speed of loss reserve line of business products underwriting duration reporting volatility major actuarial assumptions diversified financial products directors and officers liability primary medium moderate medium historical and industry loss reporting patterns professional indemnity primary medium moderate low historical loss reporting patterns surety primary medium fast low historical loss payment and reporting patterns group life  accident and health medical stop loss primary short fast low medical cost and utilization trends historical loss payment and reporting patterns rate changes aviation aviation primary and subscription medium fast medium historical loss payment and reporting patterns rate changes london market account accident and health primary and assumed medium to long slow high historical loss payment and reporting patterns energy subscription medium moderate medium historical loss payment and reporting patterns historical severity and frequency historical large loss experience property subscription medium moderate medium historical loss payment and reporting patterns historical severity and frequency historical large loss experience other specialty surplus lines business assumed medium moderate medium historical loss payment and reporting patterns discontinued accident and health reinsurance assumed long slow high historical and industry loss payment and reporting patterns includes catastrophe losses assumed reinsurance represented of our gross written premium in and of our gross reserves at december  approximately of the assumed reinsurance reserves related to assumed accident and health business in our discontinued line  related to assumed reinsurance in our london market account and related to assumed reinsurance in our aviation and diversified financial products lines of business 
the remaining assumed reinsurance reserves covered various minor reinsurance 
table of contents programs 
the table above recaps the underwriting  claims characteristics and major actuarial assumptions for our assumed reinsurance business 
the assumed accident and health business is primarily reinsurance that provides excess coverage for large losses related to workers compensation policies 
as discussed previously  we recorded million of adverse development  net of reinsurance  in and million in these losses resulted from late reporting of claims by cedants and state guaranty associations and changes in our actuarial assumptions related to this business 
to mitigate our exposure to unexpected losses reported by cedants  our claims personnel review reported losses to ensure they are reasonable and consistent with our expectations 
in addition  our claims personnel periodically audit the cedants claims processing functions to assess whether cedants are submitting timely and accurate claims reports to us 
disputes with insureds related to claims or coverage issues are administered in the normal course of business or settled through arbitration 
based on the negative factors we experienced in the past two years and the higher risk of this discontinued line of business relative to our continuing lines of business  management believes there may be a greater likelihood of future adverse development in this assumed accident and health business than in our other lines of business 
we periodically reassess loss reserves for this assumed business and adjust them  if needed 
we are pursuing commutations with certain cedants to limit our future exposure to unanticipated losses from this business 
the majority of the assumed reinsurance in our london market account  aviation and diversified financial products lines of business is facultative reinsurance 
this business involves reinsurance of a company s entire captive insurance program or business that must be written through another insurance company licensed to write insurance in a particular country or locality 
in all cases  we underwrite the business and administer the claims  which are reported without a lag by the brokers 
disputes  if any  generally relate to claims or coverage issues with insureds and are administered in the normal course of business 
we establish loss reserves for this assumed reinsurance using the same methods and assumptions we use to set reserves for comparable primary business 

table of contents the following tables show the composition of our gross  ceded and net reserves at the respective balance sheet dates 
net ibnr to net total gross ceded net reserves at december  reported loss reserves diversified financial products group life  accident and health aviation london market account other specialty lines subtotal reported reserves incurred but not reported reserves diversified financial products group life  accident and health aviation london market account other specialty lines subtotal incurred but not reported reserves discontinued lines reported reserves discontinued lines incurred but not reported reserves total loss and loss adjustment expense payable at december  reported loss reserves diversified financial products group life  accident and health aviation london market account other specialty lines subtotal reported reserves incurred but not reported reserves diversified financial products group life  accident and health aviation london market account other specialty lines subtotal incurred but not reported reserves discontinued lines reported reserves discontinued lines incurred but not reported reserves total loss and loss adjustment expense payable 
table of contents we determine our incurred but not reported reserves by first projecting the ultimate expected losses by product within each line of business 
we then subtract paid losses and reported loss reserves from the ultimate loss reserves 
the remainder is our incurred but not reported reserves 
the level of incurred but not reported reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the particular line of business  particularly with respect to the speed by which losses are reported and outstanding claims reserves are adjusted 
lines for which losses are reported fast will have a lower percentage incurred but not reported reserve than slower reporting lines  and lines for which reserve volatility is low will have a lower percentage incurred but not reported loss reserve than high volatility lines 
the reserves for reported losses related to our primary business and certain reinsurance assumed are initially set by our claims personnel or independent claims adjusters we retain 
the reserves are subject to our review  with a goal of setting them at the ultimate expected loss amount as soon as possible when the information becomes available 
reserves for reported losses related to other reinsurance assumed are recorded based on information supplied to us by the ceding company 
our claims personnel monitor these reinsurance assumed reserves on a current basis and audit ceding companies claims to ascertain that claims are being recorded currently and that net reserves are being set at levels that properly reflect the liability related to the claims 
the percentage of net incurred but not reported reserves to net total reserves increased slightly from at december  to at december  the reasons for the significant changes in net reserves by line of business follow diversified financial products total net reserves in our diversified financial products line of business increased million from to as this relatively new line of business continues to grow 
the incurred but not reported portion of the total reserves for this line of business is higher than in most of our other lines  since these losses report slower and have a longer duration 
group life  accident and health incurred but not reported reserves have decreased and reported reserves have increased due to a speed up in the reporting of medical stop loss claims 
london market account total net reserves in our london market account increased million and the percentage of incurred but not reported reserves increased in  due to estimated unreported claims for the hurricanes 
discontinued lines total net reserves for our discontinued lines increased million in primarily as a result of a commutation 
the percentage of net incurred but not reported reserves to total reserves for discontinued lines decreased to as claims continued to be reported and reported reserves were reassessed 
with the exception of when we had negative development principally in the reserves related to our discontinued line of business  our net reserves historically have shown positive development except for the effects of losses on commutations  which we have completed in the past and may negotiate in the future 
commutations can produce negative prior year development since  under generally accepted accounting principles  any excess of undiscounted reserves assumed over assets received must be recorded as a loss at the time the commutation is completed 
economically  the loss generally represents the discount for the time value of money that will be earned over the payout of the reserves  thus  the loss may be recouped as investment income is earned on the assets received 
based on our reserving techniques and our past results  we believe that our net reserves are adequate 
we have no material exposure to environmental pollution losses 
our largest insurance company subsidiary only began writing business in and its policies normally contain pollution exclusion clauses which limit pollution coverage to sudden and accidental losses only  thus excluding intentional dumping and seepage claims 
policies issued by our other insurance company subsidiaries do not have significant environmental exposures because of the types of risks covered 
therefore  we do not expect to experience any material loss development for environmental pollution claims 
likewise  we have no material exposure to asbestos claims 

table of contents reinsurance recoverables certain reinsurers have delayed or suspended payment of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts to which we are a party 
we limit our liquidity exposure for uncollected recoverables by holding funds  letters of credit or other security  such that net balances due are significantly less than the gross balances shown in our consolidated balance sheets 
we constantly monitor the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables of our insurance companies and record a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance when we determine an amount is potentially uncollectible 
our evaluation is based on our periodic reviews of our disputed and aged recoverables  as well as our assessment of recoverables due from reinsurers known to be in financial difficulty 
in some cases  we make estimates as to what portion of a recoverable may be uncollectible 
our estimates and judgment about the collectibility of the recoverables and the financial condition of reinsurers can change  and these changes can affect the level of reserve required 
the reserve was million at december   compared to million at december  we increased the reserve in by million to cover additional recoverables for which changed conditions caused us to believe that part or all of the outstanding balances may not be collectible 
amounts charged against the reserve in were million and in were immaterial 
we also reclassified million to our liability for indemnifications during the year 
we recently assessed the collectibility of our year end recoverables related to our hurricane losses and believe amounts are collectible based on currently available information 
we are currently in negotiations with most reinsurers who have delayed or suspended payments  but if such negotiations do not result in a satisfactory resolution  we may seek or be involved in litigation or arbitration 
we resolved certain arbitrations in  amounts with respect to the remaining arbitration and litigation proceedings that we initiated are not material 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings  taxable income in carry back years and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  with the exception of the benefit of certain pre acquisition tax loss carryforwards for which valuation allowances have been provided 
if there is a material change in the tax laws such that the actual effective tax rate changes or the time periods within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible change  we will need to reevaluate our assumptions  which could result in a change in the valuation allowance required 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in determining the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize the expected cash flow approach in statement of financial accounting concepts con  using cash flow information and present values in accounting measurements 
this approach utilizes a risk free rate of interest  estimates of future cash flows and probabilities as to the occurrence of the future cash flows 
we utilize our budgets and projection of future operations based on historical and expected industry trends to estimate our future cash flows and the probability of their occurring as projected 
based on our latest impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by a satisfactory margin 
other than temporary impairments on investments declines in the market value of invested assets below cost are evaluated for other than temporary impairment losses on a quarterly basis 
impairment losses for declines in value of fixed income securities below cost attributable to issuer specific events are based on all relevant facts and circumstances for each 
table of contents investment and are recognized when appropriate 
for fixed income securities with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
at december   we had gross unrealized losses on fixed income securities of million of aggregate market value compared to million of aggregate market value at december  recent accounting pronouncements share based payment the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to charge the fair value of stock based compensation to earnings  with adoption required as of january  sfas r allows either a prospective or retrospective adoption method 
we will adopt sfas r in using the modified prospective method  whereby results for prior periods will not be restated 
compensation expense recognized going forward will be based on our unvested stock options granted before january  and all options granted after that date 
we will use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of an option on its grant date and will expense that value over the option s vesting period 
at december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options that is expected to be recognized through  of which we expect to recognize approximately million in had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts calculated under sfas  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate impact of adoption of sfas r in future periods will depend on the following the amount and timing of options granted  exercised and forfeited  the assumptions used to model fair value and certain tax reporting requirements 
we generally recognize a tax benefit when our employees exercise options 
sfas r requires that  in future periods  we report the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
we cannot estimate what the tax benefits or cash flow amounts will be in the future because they depend on a variety of factors  including when employees exercise stock options 
however  we recognized operating cash flows of million  million and million in  and  respectively  for tax deductions associated with options exercised 
other than temporary impairments the fasb has issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fsp requires recognition of an impairment loss on a debt security no later than when the investor deems the impairment is other than temporary  even if the investor has not decided to sell the security 
this standard replaces current guidance in emerging issues task force issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the new standard is effective january  we expect that adoption of this fsp will have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accounting changes and corrections the fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  as a replacement of apb no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas requires restatement of all prior period financial statements if a company makes an accounting change or corrects an error 
the standard is effective january  we will apply the standard  if applicable  in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed income securities and variable rate debt  and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk utilizing the information below 
actual results could differ materially from estimates below for a variety of reasons  including amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to change over time  assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate  market changes could be different from market changes assumed below and not all factors and balances are taken into account 
interest rate risk to manage the exposures of our investment risks  we generally invest in investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of the insurance liabilities of our insurance companies 
we have not used derivatives to manage any of our investment related market risks 
the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the fair value of our fixed income securities was billion at december  and billion at december  if market interest rates were to change eg from to  the fair value of our fixed income securities would have changed approximately million at december  this compares to a change in value of million at december  for the same change in market interest rates 
the change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
our million revolving loan facility is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on this loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  there was no balance outstanding under this line of credit 
our and convertible notes are not subject to interest rate changes 
foreign exchange risk the table below shows the net amounts of significant foreign currency balances for subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency at december  and converted to us dollars 
it also shows the expected dollar change in fair value in thousands that would occur if exchange rates changed from exchange rates in effect at those times
