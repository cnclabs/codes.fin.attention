the credit facility replaced the existing revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  which was scheduled to mature on october  the credit facility allows us to obtain revolving credit loans and provides for the issuance of letters of credit 
for each borrowing under the credit facility  we can generally choose to have the interest rate for that borrowing calculated based on either jpmorgan chase bank s publicly announced new york prime rate or on a eurodollar as defined in our new five year credit agreement rate plus a spread 
the spread is determined based on our total debt to ebitda as defined in our new five year credit agreement ratio then in effect  and ranges from

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time the service is rendered or the product is delivered 
payments received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of the product are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the services are performed or the product is delivered 
for all sales  we require either a purchase order  a statement of work signed by the client  a written contract  or some other form of written authorization from the client 
our accounting policy for revenue recognition has an impact on our reported results and relies on certain estimates that require judgments on the part of management 
the portion of our revenue that is most subject to estimates and judgments is revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method  as discussed below 
specifically  direct marketing revenue from certain projects and certain services such as database build services  internet web design  market research and analytical services may be billed at hourly rates or a set price 
if billed at a set price  the revenue is recognized over the contractual period  using the percentage of completion method 
management estimates and judgments are used in connection with the revenue recognized in these instances 
should actual costs differ significantly from the original estimated costs  the timing of revenues and overall profitability of the contract could be impacted 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method constituted less than of total direct marketing revenue and less than of our total revenue for the years ended december   and direct marketing revenue is derived from a variety of services and products 
revenue from services such as creative and graphics  printing  personalization of communication pieces using laser and inkjet printing  targeted mail  fulfillment  agency services and transportation logistics are recognized as the work is performed 
revenue is typically based on a set price or rate given to the client 

table of contents revenue from the ongoing production and delivery of data is recognized upon completion and delivery of the work and is typically based on a set price or rate 
revenue from database subscriptions is based on a set price and is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
revenue from database build services may be billed based on hourly rates or at a set price 
if billed at a set price  the database build revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on individual costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
revenue from market research and analytical services may be billed based on hourly rates or a set price 
if billed at a set price  the revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on individual costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
in other instances  progress toward completion is based on performance milestones specified in the contract where such milestones fairly reflect progress toward contract completion 
revenue related to e marketing  lead management  multi channel customer care  inbound and outbound teleservices and technical support is typically billed based on a set price per transaction or service provided 
revenue from these services is recognized as the service or activity is performed 
revenue from software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the respective elements 
for software sales with multiple elements for example  software licenses with undelivered post contract customer support or pcs  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means we defer revenue from the software sale equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the fair value of pcs is based upon separate sales of renewals to other clients or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
the fair value of services  such as training and consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other clients 
the revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenue allocated to professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
the revenue allocated to software products  including time based software licenses  is recognized  if collection is probable  upon execution of a licensing agreement and shipment of the software or ratably over the term of the license  depending on the structure and terms of the arrangement 
if the licensing agreement is for a term of one year or less and includes pcs  we recognize the software and the pcs revenue ratably over the term of the license 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware to our hosted software service transactions 
for certain non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
as described above  sometimes our customer arrangements have multiple deliverables  including service elements 
generally  our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of specific accounting standards 
table of contents that provide guidance regarding the separation of elements in multiple deliverable arrangements and the allocation of consideration among those elements eg  aicpa sop software revenue recognition 
if not  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the provisions of eitf require us to unbundle multiple element arrangements into separate units of accounting when the delivered element s has stand alone value and fair value of the undelivered element s exist 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to each unit 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to the entire arrangement 
this might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized from the arrangement 
shoppers services are considered rendered  and the revenue recognized  when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the mailing material has been received by the united states postal service 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts at a balance adequate to reduce accounts receivable to the amount of cash expected to be realized upon collection 
the methodology used to determine the minimum allowance balance is based on our prior collection experience and is generally related to the accounts receivable balance in various aging categories 
the balance is also influenced by specific clients financial strength and circumstance 
accounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible 
periodic changes to the allowance balance are recorded as increases or decreases to bad debt expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded bad debt expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if future bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
given the significance of accounts receivable to the consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability we increased our deductible for individual healthcare claims from  to  and eliminated our aggregate annual claims deductible in we have a  deductible for automobile and general liability claims 
our deductible for workers compensation decreased from million to  in october management makes various subjective judgments about a number of factors in determining our reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance  and the related expense 
if ultimate losses were higher than our estimate at december   earnings would be impacted by up to  net of taxes 
the amount that earnings would be impacted is dependent on the claim year and our deductible levels for that plan year 
periodic changes to the reserve for workers compensation  automobile and general liability are recorded as increases or decreases to insurance expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statement of operations 
periodic changes to the reserve for healthcare are recorded as increases or decreases to employee benefits expense  which is included in the payroll line of our consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill goodwill is recorded to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   goodwill was being amortized on a straight line basis over to year periods 
beginning january   goodwill is no longer being amortized  but instead is tested for impairment as discussed below 

table of contents we assess the impairment of our goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 by determining the fair value of each of our reporting units and comparing the fair value to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
we have identified our reporting units as direct marketing and shoppers 
fair value is determined using projected discounted future cash flows and cash flow multiple models  based on historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we must calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities recognized and unrecognized in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  and then compare this implied fair value to its carrying amount
