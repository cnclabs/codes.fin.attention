item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
general the primary objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the wilber corporation and its subsidiary for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes presented in part ii  item  of this document 
our financial performance is heavily dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on our loans and investment securities less the interest paid on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  investment securities gains losses  service charges and penalty fees on deposit accounts  fees collected for trust and investment services  insurance commission income  the increase on the cash surrender value on bank owned life insurance  other service fees  other income and taxes 
our non interest expenses primarily consist of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing  professional fees  and other miscellaneous expenses 
results of operations are also influenced by general economic conditions particularly changes in interest rates  competitive conditions  government policies  changes in federal or state tax law  and the actions of our regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions significantly deteriorated  additional provisions for loan losses would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s non performing loans and potential problem loans have a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management has concluded that the evaluation of collateral values was reasonable under the circumstances for each of the reported periods  if collateral valuations were significantly lowered the company s allowance for loan losses would also require an additional provision for loan losses 
our policy on the allowance for loan losses is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of the allowance for loan losses is included in part ii  item ca  of this document 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in note of the consolidated financial statements provided in part ii  item  of this document to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
accounting for branch acquisition 
on february   the bank acquired two branch offices from hsbc bank usa  national association hsbc  one in sidney  new york  and one in walton  new york 
under the terms of our agreement with hsbc  we assumed deposit liabilities with a fair value of million  and acquired loans with a fair value of million  and property  equipment  and other tangible assets with a fair value of thousand 
this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
states that a business combination occurs when an entity acquires net assets that constitute a business  as defined by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a non monetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
eitf no 
states that a business is a self sustaining integrated set of activities and assets conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors 
a business consists of inputs long lived assets  intellectual property  the ability to obtain access to necessary materials or rights  employees  etc  processes the existence of systems necessary for normal  self sustaining operations and outputs the ability to obtain access to customers 
the branch purchase involved the acquisition of i long lived and intangible assets building  core deposit intangible  and equipment  ii employees branch management and staff  iii certain processes administration of personnel  operational processes  and strategic management processes  and iv the ability to obtain access to customers who purchase outputs deposit and loan customers and accounts of the acquired branch were included in the purchase 
for these reasons  we recorded the acquisition as a business combination within the scope of sfas no 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded goodwill of million and a core deposit intangible of thousand 
k recent accounting pronouncements 
the eitf reached consensus in march   regarding guidance provided in eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the purpose of eitf issue no 
is to determine the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain securities  including debt and equity securities that are within the scope of sfas no 
guidance in eitf issue no 
should be used to determine when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impaired loss 
this guidance also includes accounting considerations for securities subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairment  and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary 
portions of this guidance were effective for reporting periods beginning after june   and other portions will be deliberated further 
this delay does not suspend the current requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
the company has not identified any other than temporary impairment in its securities portfolio as of december  subsequent to the fasb final deliberations  the company will evaluate the potential impact on its process of identifying other than temporary declines in value of its debt and equity securities 
management does not believe that the provision  as currently written  will have a material impact on the results of operations for several quarters prospectively 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  therefore  the company has adopted this statement  as applicable  on january  in december   the financial accounting standards board revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity i exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  or ii incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of grant 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal quarters beginning july  since we do not currently have an employee stock option plan or any other form of stock based compensation  this pronouncement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements

performance overview for period ended december  during  several of our key performance measures decreased significantly  as compared to net income  earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity all decreased between the periods ended december   and december  specifically  net income decreased from million in to million in  an thousand  or decrease 
earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity decreased from   and  respectively  in  to   and  respectively  in although our net interest income increased thousand between and  it was offset by a million increase in non interest expense and a thousand increase in the provision for loan losses 
the increase in non interest expense was driven by increases in salaries  employee benefits expense  computer service fees  professional fees  and other miscellaneous expenses 
during  we converted our core computer system  focused resources on bank related compliance efforts  and incurred increases in professional fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
these endeavors required us to purchase substantial amounts of new computer hardware and software  engage computer  accounting and other professional service firms  pay overtime wages  and create several new full and part time job positions 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to a decline in some of our key loan quality measures 
although several of our key performance measures decreased during  we experienced growth in our primary lines of business  namely deposits and loans 
total deposits increased from million at december   to million at december   a million  or increase 
the increase in our total deposits was principally driven by our hsbc branch acquisition 
during the first quarter of  we assumed million of deposit liabilities as a result of the acquisition 
similarly  total loans increased from million at december   to million at december   a million  or increase 
this growth was driven by both the hsbc branch acquisition and our continuing efforts to increase the size of our small business loan portfolio 
k during  some of our key loan quality measures worsened 
in particular  the amount of non performing loans and loans charged off net of recoveries both increased 
at december   total non performing loans and total non performing loans as a percent of total loans were million and  as compared to million and at december   a million  or basis point increase 
during the fourth quarter of  the financial condition of one of our large commercial borrowers declined rapidly 
this required us to place our loans to the borrower  totaling thousand  on non accrual status 
during the third quarter we also restructured a troubled loan for a community oriented  not for profit business 
the balance of the loan at december   was thousand 
the loans to these two borrowers comprised of the net increase in non performing loans between december   and december  during the fourth quarter of  the amount of loans charged off net of recoveries increased precipitously 
we experienced a sudden spike in net charge offs in the consumer loan and commercial loan portfolio 
through the end of the third quarter of  loans charged off net of recoveries totaled thousand 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded thousand in net charge offs 
of the increase  thousand was due to the charge off of loans made to one commercial borrower 
the remaining portion of the fourth quarter increase  totaling thousand  was recorded in the consumer loan portfolio 
management attributes the sudden increase in consumer loan charge offs to the change in the federal bankruptcy law that took effect during the fourth quarter 
the allowance for loan losses and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans both increased between december   and december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december   as compared to million at december  similarly  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period end loans increased from at december   to at december  the company s management believes the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december   to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio

financial condition a 
comparison of financial condition at december   and december  please refer to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item  of this document 
asset composition our assets are comprised of earning and non earning assets 
earning assets include our investment securities  loans  interest bearing deposits at other banks  and federal funds sold 
non earning assets include our real estate and other assets acquired as the result of foreclosure  facilities  equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  non interest bearing deposits at other banks  and cash 
we generally maintain to of our total assets in earning assets 
the ratio of earning assets to total assets we maintained during and was slightly greater than the ratio maintained by comparable bank holding companies 
total assets during  our total assets increased slightly  from million at december   to million at december   a million  or less than increase 
this compares to a increase in total assets between december   and december  during  we acquired million of deposit liabilities from hsbc  but repaid million of short and long term borrowings 
during our management repaid maturing borrowings as they came due  which curbed growth in total assets 
throughout most of the yield curve was flat 
this interest rate environment reduced the bank s ability to earn spread on borrowed funds  which prompted management to repay rather than renew most borrowings during investment securities our investment securities portfolio consists of trading  available for sale  and held to maturity securities 
the following table summarizes our trading  available for sale  and held to maturity investment securities portfolio for the periods indicated 
k summary of investment securities at december amortized estimated amortized estimated amortized estimated cost fair value cost fair value cost fair value in thousands trading       available for sale us treasuries       obligations of us government corporations and agencies       obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds       mortgage backed securities       corporate bonds   equity securities       total available for sale       held to maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds       mortgage backed securities       total held to maturity       these securities are held by the company for its non qualified executive deferred compensation plan 
between december   and december   our investment securities portfolio including trading  available for sale  and held to maturity decreased million  or 
during  we sold or had mature million of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities versus new purchases of million 
proceeds from the sale or maturity of the investment securities portfolio in excess of new purchases were generally used to fund growth in our loan portfolio 
during  we continued to reduce our concentration in mortgage backed securities 
these include both mortgage pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
at the end of  our mortgage backed securities portfolio comprised of the carrying value of our investment securities portfolio 
this compares to and at the end of and  respectively 
during and  residential mortgage interest rates were very low 
this boosted housing starts and provided considerable incentive for consumers to refinance their existing home 
this  in turn  significantly accelerated the level of principal pre payments on our mortgage backed securities  requiring us to record unprecedented levels of amortization of premiums on investments in those years 
since the prepayment options embedded in mortgage backed securities provides for more volatile investment securities cash flows and yields  the bank s management reduced its concentration in mortgage backed securities during and and increased its holdings of us treasury and us government corporation and agency bonds 
the estimated fair value of the investment portfolio is largely dependent upon the interest rate environment at the time the market price is determined 
as interest rates decline  the estimated fair value of bonds generally increases  and conversely  as interest rates increase  the estimated fair value of bonds generally decreases 
at december   the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
by comparison  at december   the net unrealized gain on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was thousand 
the change in net unrealized investment securities gains losses between the periods was due to several factors  including the general rise in interest rates between the periods  the change in the composition of our investment securities portfolio  as well as the sale of available for sale securities 
during and  respectively  we purchased million and million of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities due principally to the high k levels of prepayments on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
during those periods the coupon rates and yields on investment securities were very low 
for this reason  management anticipates that the company s available for sale investment securities portfolio will remain in a net unrealized loss position during the following table sets forth information regarding the carrying value  weighted average yields  and anticipated principal repayments of the bank s investment securities portfolio as of december  all amortizing security principal payments  including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage pass through securities  are included based on their expected average lives 
callable securities  primarily callable agency securities  and municipal bonds are assumed to mature on their maturity date 
available for sale securities are shown at fair value 
held to maturity securities are shown at their amortized cost 
the yields on debt securities shown in the table below are calculated by dividing annual interest  including accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums  by the amortized cost of the securities at december  yields on obligations of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were not tax effected

this estimate was established based upon projected cash flows provided by a third party investment securities analyst and is used to provide comparisons with other companies in the banking industry 
our estimate fluctuates considerably from period to period due to our concentration in mortgage backed securities 
the credit quality of our debt securities is strong 
at december   of the securities held in our available for sale and held to maturity investment securities portfolio were rated a or better by moody s credit rating services  were rated aaa 
this compares to and  respectively  for the period ended december  at december   we also held million of equity securities including million in fhlbny stock  a million equity interest in a small business investment company  meridian venture partners ii  l 
p  million of common stock holdings of other banking institutions  thousand of federal reserve bank of new york stock  thousand in new york business development corporation stock  and thousand in a money market mutual fund 
by comparison  at december   equity securities totaled million at estimated fair value 
the increase in the estimated fair value of equity securities between the periods totaling thousand was due to a thousand increase in the common stock of other banking institutions primarily due to additional security purchases during and a thousand increase in the bank s investment in meridian venture partners ii  lp  offset by a thousand decrease in fhlbny stock and a thousand decrease in the money market mutual fund balance 
interest bearing bank balances and federal funds sold during  we substantially reduced our time deposits with other banks 
at december   time deposits at other banks were million  as compared to million at december   a million decrease 
these balances are comprised of fdic insured certificates of deposit in amounts of  or less in various fdic insured banks throughout the united states 
all of the certificates of deposit were acquired by the bank during the execution of k wholesale leverage transactions in  and the certificates of deposit purchased in december and january original total million were funded by equal amounts of fhlbny advances with identical maturity terms 
the cost of the advances were below the yield on the like maturity certificates of deposit at the time of purchase 
all of the certificates of deposit currently in our portfolio will mature prior to december in the normal course of business  we sell and purchase federal funds to and from other banks to meet our daily liquidity needs 
because the funds are generally an unsecured obligation of the counter party  we only sell federal funds to well capitalized banks that carry strong credit ratings 
given the daily fluctuation in our federal funds sold position throughout the year  it is appropriate to compare the annual average federal funds sold positions rather than the positions at the end of the periods 
during  our average federal funds sold position was million 
by comparison  during  our average federal funds sold position was million 
loan portfolio general 
the total loan portfolio increased by million  or  during total loans outstanding at december   were million  as compared to million at december  during  we acquired million of loans during the hsbc branch acquisition and continued to increase the loans outstanding in the commercial and commercial real estate categories 
this was due to our efforts to expand our market area and focus our resources on this type of lending 
during  we established a new representative loan production office in the syracuse  new york onondaga county market  continued to seek loan opportunities with select loan brokers  expanded our network of banks to grow participation loans  and maintained a geographic footprint for small business loans that extended beyond our primary market area 
the following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio over the prior five year period 
distribution of loans table at december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential real estate      commercial real estate      commercial      consumer      total loans      less allowance for loan losses      net loans      includes loans secured by family residential dwellings  family residential dwellings  home equity loans and residential construction loans 
includes commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans and obligations other than securities and leases of states and political subdivisions in the united states during the prior five year period the composition of our loan portfolio has generally shifted from one with a concentration in residential real estate to one with a concentration in commercial real estate and commercial primarily small business loans 
however  during our residential loan portfolio increased modestly  primarily due to an increase in home equity loans 
during the first quarter of we acquired the loans of two branch offices of hsbc 
the majority of the loans acquired were loans secured by residential properties 
in addition  we continued to actively promote and competitively price our variable rate home equity line of credit product known as the prestige line of credit 
the loan balances outstanding in the residential real estate category increased million or during  from million at december  to million at december  our commercial real estate portfolio increased during due to our continued emphasis on small business lending and the low interest rate environment 
specifically  our commercial real estate portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december   a million or increase 
k our commercial loan portfolio decreased million or during  from million at december  to million at december  during two large commercial borrowers repaid their loans with us 
one paid off approximately million on a line of credit  which the bank continues to maintain 
the other borrower paid off all loans with the bank  totaling million 
in spite of the decrease in this category of loans during  we will continue to focus our efforts on increasing the balances of our small business loan portfolio prospectively 
during  we increased our total consumer loans outstanding by million or 
during  we continued to broaden our automobile dealer network to increase the volume of our indirect automobile loans secured primarily by used vehicles 
these efforts resulted in a million increase in loans outstanding in this category 
in management s opinion  higher levels of growth in indirect loans were curbed by a reduced level of used automobile sales in our primary market area 
at december   our indirect automobile loan portfolio was comprised of  accounts  totaling million 
this compares to  accounts and million at december   a net increase in accounts and net increase in indirect automobile loan volume outstanding 
the following table sets forth the amount of loans maturing and repricing in our portfolio 
the full principal amount outstanding of adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which the interest rate is next scheduled to adjust 
similarly  the full principal amount outstanding of fixed rate loans are shown based on their final maturity date 
the full principal amount outstanding of demand loans without a repayment schedule and no stated maturity  financed accounts receivable  and overdrafts are reported as due within one year

includes commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans and obligations other than securities and leases of states and political subdivisions in the united states k commitments and lines of credit 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
since most of the standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december  and december  standby letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and december  the fair value of the bank s standby letters of credit was not material 
in addition to standby letters of credit  we have issued lines of credit and other commitments to lend to our customers 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
these include home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans  commercial letters of credit  and other personal and commercial lines of credit 
at december  and december  we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments of million and million  respectively  representing a million or increase period over period 
the increase in the unfunded loan commitments was primarily due to growth in the unused portion of commercial and home equity lines of credit 
asset quality and risk elements general 
one of our key objectives is to maintain strong credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the following narrative provides summary information and our experience regarding the quality and risk elements of our loan portfolio 
delinquent loans 
at december   we had million of loans that were or more days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
by comparison  at december  we had million of this same category of loans that were or more days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
management considers the level of delinquent loans as low relative to prior years levels and attributes the low levels of delinquency to improved delinquent loan collection procedures implemented in non accrual  past due and restructured loans 
the following chart sets forth information regarding non performing assets for the periods stated 
table of non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans in non accrual status residential real estate commercial real estate      commercial   consumer total non accruing loans      loans contractually past due days or more and still accruing interest troubled debt restructured loans total non performing loans      other real estate owned total non performing assets      total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans includes loans secured by family residential dwellings  family residential dwellings  home equity loans and residential construction loans 
includes commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans and obligations other than securities and leases of states and political subdivisions in the united states k total non performing assets increased from million at december   to million at december   a million or increase 
the substantial majority of the increase in non performing assets was due to the decline in the financial condition of two of our large borrowers 
during the third quarter of we restructured a credit facility for a struggling not for profit company 
the loan balance at december  was thousand and was current under the restructured terms 
during the fourth quarter of the financial condition of one of our large commercial borrowers deteriorated rapidly 
due to the borrowers financial condition and past due status  we determined it was necessary to place the borrower s loans with us on non accrual status 
the total loans outstanding with the borrower were thousand at december  other real estate owned and repossessed assets 
other real estate owned oreo consists of properties formerly pledged as collateral on loans  which have been acquired by the bank through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
oreo is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the real estate  less estimated costs to sell 
at both december  and december  we held insignificant amounts of oreo property totaling less than thousand 
potential problem loans 
in addition to non performing loans  we have identified through normal credit review procedures potential problem loans totaling million or of total loans outstanding at december  by comparison  at december   potential problem loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as non performing at some time in the future 
potential problem loans are typically loans that are performing  but are classified by our loan rating system as substandard 
potential problem loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a rating upgrade of loans previously classified as substandard or a rating downgrade of loans previously carried in a higher credit classification 
management does not believe the decrease in potential problem loans  totaling thousand between december   and december  to be significant or indicative of an improvement in the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on non accrual status  become restructured  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
loan concentrations 
at december  we had million of total loans outstanding and million of unfunded loan commitments secured by commercial rental properties 
total loans outstanding in this category comprised of our total loans outstanding at december  we have nine borrowers within this area of concentration that each has outstanding loan balances in excess of million 
the aggregate amount of loans outstanding to these nine borrowers at december   was million 
all of these loans were in compliance with contractual payment terms at december  the remaining portfolio was comprised of approximately seventy five loans and spread amongst a diverse group of properties and borrowers 
by comparison  at december   we had million of commercial rental property loans outstanding with seven of these loans in excess of million totaling million 
at december  we had outstanding million or of our total loans outstanding to borrowers who operate in the hotel motel industry 
by comparison  at december  we had outstanding million  or of our total loans outstanding in this same category 
the hotel motel properties that we finance are geographically dispersed throughout our market area and the broader statewide region 
the bank s board of directors has established a specific exposure guideline for this hotel motel industry at of the bank s total equity capital  which at december  was million 
at december  we had million of total loan outstanding and million of unfunded loan commitments to manufacturing companies 
total loans outstanding in this category comprised of our total loans outstanding at december  this compares to million in loans outstanding and million of unfunded loan commitments to this sector at december  although our borrowers operate in various industries within the manufacturing sector  we have experienced a general decline in the financial condition of several borrowers within this sector 
we have eight borrowers in the manufacturing sector with aggregate credit facilities in excess of million 
five of these have either been placed on non accrual status  identified as a potential problem loan  or identified as a special mention loan requiring special monitoring 
at december  we had of total loans outstanding and million of unfunded loan commitments secured by residential rental properties 
total loans outstanding in this category comprised of our total loans outstanding at december  within this group we had six loans to four borrowers totaling approximately million that operate independent living  assisted living  or residential care facilities for senior citizens 
none of these k loans was classified as substandard at december  and all were performing pursuant to contractual terms 
by comparison  at december  we had million of total loan commitments in this same category 
at december  we had million of total loans outstanding and million of unfunded loan commitments to automotive dealerships 
total loans outstanding in this category comprised of our total loans outstanding at december  the largest eight borrowers comprise million or of the loan commitments to this industry 
management monitors the dealer floor plan loans provided to six of these seven borrowers by conducting inventory reviews on a monthly basis 
at december  we had million of total loans outstanding and million of unfunded loan commitments to borrowers in the convenience store fuel business 
total loans outstanding in this category comprised of our total loans outstanding at december  by comparison  at december   we had million of total loan commitments to this industry 
at december  none of the loans to these borrowers were rated substandard by our management 
these loans were primarily distributed among five borrowers 
we have loan commitments totaling million to one borrower in this industry 
other areas of concentration at december   include million of loan commitments to medical facilities and medical practices  million of loan commitments to general residential and commercial contractors  million of loan commitments to various restaurants  and million of loan commitments to religious and human services organizations 
although we classified these industries as areas of credit concentration  we believe the aggregate exposure to these industries do not pose unwarranted amounts of risk to the company

in the provision for loan losses increased to million  versus million in during  two of our key credit quality measures  namely net charge offs and non performing loans  worsened  as compared to these trends in our loan portfolio  as well as the decline in the financial condition of one of our large commercial borrowers during the fourth quarter of  prompted us to increase the provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter to absorb the estimated losses embedded in our loan portfolio 
management and the board of directors deemed the allowance for loan losses as adequate at december  and december  allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
we allocate our allowance for loan losses among the loan categories indicated below 
this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories  or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
additionally  since management regards the allowance for loan losses as a general balance  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories

in order to operate the bank on a daily basis  it is necessary for us to maintain a limited amount of cash at our teller stations and within our vaults and atms to meet customers demands 
in addition  we always maintain an amount of check and other presentment items in the process of collection or float 
we are also required to maintain a clearing reserve balance at the federal reserve bank of new york and minimum target balances at our correspondent banks 
at december   we maintained million  or of total assets in these categories of non earning assets 
this compares to million  or of total assets at december  premises and equipment 
the net book value of premises and equipment increased thousand or  from million at december   to million at december  during  we acquired thousand of real property and equipment in the hsbc branch acquisition and purchased significant amounts of computer equipment for our core computer system conversion and expansion activities 
bank owned life insurance 
the cash surrender value of the life insurance at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the cash surrender value of the policies between the periods totaling thousand 
the policies are issued by four life insurance k companies who all carry strong financial strength ratings 
the policies are issued on the lives of the bank s senior management 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of the hsbc branch transaction in february   we recorded million in goodwill and thousand in core deposit intangible 
no impairment of the goodwill from the hsbc transaction or previous transactions was deemed necessary during the thousand increase in core deposit intangible was offset by thousand of amortization expense on the hsbc core deposit intangible  as well as previously recorded intangible assets  resulting in a thousand net increase 
the core deposit intangible on the hsbc acquisition is being amortized over years on a straight line basis 
other assets 
other assets increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  other assets are comprised of other real estate owned  interest receivable  prepaid dealer reserve  prepaid pension plan asset  computer software  net deferred tax assets  deferred taxes on investment securities  other assets  other prepaid items  and other accounts receivable 
several factors contributed to the net increase in other assets between the periods 
the largest contributing factor to the increase in other assets was the significant swing in our deferred taxes on investment securities between the periods 
our deferred taxes on investment securities increased million between the periods due to the significant decline in net unrealized gains losses in our available for sale investment securities portfolio between december  and december  at december  the net unrealized gain on our available for sale investment securities portfolio was thousand 
this compares to a net unrealized loss of million at december composition of liabilities deposits 
deposits are our primary funding source 
at december  deposits represented of our total liabilities  compared to at december  at december  our total deposits were million 
this compares to million at december   a million or increase 
the increase in total deposits was primarily attributable to our hsbc branch acquisition in the first quarter of  in which we assumed million of deposit liabilities 
at december   million or of our total deposits were in accounts without a stated maturity date versus million or of total deposits in certificates of deposit 
this compares to million or of total deposits and million or of total deposits  respectively  at december  the following table indicates the amount of our time accounts by time remaining until maturity as of december  time accounts maturity table maturity as of december  over to dollars in thousands months over to over or less months months months total certificates of deposit of  or more      certificates of deposit less than       total of time accounts      foreign deposits in domestic offices 
at december   we held million of deposits from foreign depositors 
this compares to million at december  the substantial majority of these deposit relationships were acquired during when we purchased certain assets and all of the deposit liabilities from the first national bank of downsville in delaware county  new york 
due to the difficulty associated with servicing our foreign depositors  during we asked each of these customers to close their accounts upon maturity 
at december   a few certificates of deposit and other interest bearing accounts remained active 
borrowings 
total borrowed funds consist of short term and long term borrowings 
short term borrowings include federal funds purchased  treasury  tax  and loan notes held for the benefit of the us treasury department  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with our customers and other third parties 
long term borrowings consist of monies we k borrowed from the fhlbny for various funding requirements and wholesale funding strategies 
at december   our ratio of borrowed funds including short term and long term borrowings to total liabilities decreased as compared to december  total borrowed funds were million or of total liabilities at december   as compared to million or of total liabilities at december   a million decrease 
during  upon acquisition of the hsbc branches  we repaid a million borrowing from a large money center bank 
the monies were initially borrowed in the fourth quarter of to purchase million of available for sale investment securities with the intention of replacing the borrowing with the core deposit liabilities assumed in the hsbc branch acquisition 
in addition  throughout we repaid other short term and long term borrowings as they came due 
in prior years  management has borrowed funds at the fhlbny for the purpose of acquiring investment securities or time deposits at other banks to increase net interest income 
management did not execute any new such wholesale leverage transactions during due to a poor interest rate climate  most notably the flat treasury yield curve

summary 
net income for was million 
this was thousand or less than net income of million 
this resulted in a decrease in earnings per share 
earnings per share were in  as compared to in although net interest income and several components of non interest income improved year over year  they were negated by an increase in non interest expense  an increase in the provision for loan losses  and a decrease in net investment securities gains 
in net interest income increased thousand 
this was principally due to an increase in both the volume and the yield on the loan portfolio 
this improvement was offset by a million increase in non interest expense 
in we incurred significant increases in most components of non interest expense due to expansion activities  the core computer system conversion  and significant regulatory compliance efforts  including sarbanes oxley act compliance and bank secrecy act anti money laundering compliance 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded thousand in the provision for loan losses to increase the allowance for loan losses to a level that reflected the estimated embedded losses in the portfolio 
the substantial increase in the provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter was principally due to the substantial decline in the financial condition of one of our large commercial borrowers and increase in net charge offs 
in we recorded million of investment securities gains due principally to the sale of million of available for sale investment securities 
low interest rates through the period allowed us to sell investment securities at substantial gains to our book value 
during interest rates increased  which reduced the level of investment securities gains on available for sale securities 
as a result  during we sold million of available for sale investment securities and recorded thousand of net investment securities gains 
our return on average assets declined from in to in similarly  our return on average stockholders equity also declined from in to in in average assets and average stockholders equity increased  while net income declined  resulting in a lower return on average assets and lower return on average equity 
net interest income 
net interest income is our most significant source of earnings

this compares to and  respectively  for for this reason  the following tables  including the asset and yield summary table  the interest rate table and the rate and volume table and the associated analytical narrative are important components of our results of operations 
the following table summarizes the total dollar amount of interest income from average earnings assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense and rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities

average net loans equal average total loans less the average allowance for loan losses 
however  for purposes of these computations  non accrual loans are included in average loan balances outstanding 
net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin  also known as the net yield on average interest earning assets  represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
k net interest income increased thousand or in during national interest rates increased see comparative interest rate table below for an quarter history of interest rates 
these changes  particularly the changes to the national prime rate of interest eight basis point increases totaling basis points  helped increase the average yield on net loans from in to in during we maintained approximately million in variable rate loans 
the substantial majority of these variable rate loans were indexed to the national prime rate  which contributed to the improved yield on these assets 
the interest income on our loan portfolio increased from million in to million in  a million or increase 
also during the year  we increased the average dollar volume of loans outstanding through our loan production efforts and the hsbc branch acquisition 
during the average volume of our net loans was million  as compared to million during  a increase 
in addition to increases in interest income on loans  during we recorded an increase in the interest income on our investment securities 
although our average volume of securities decreased during  as loans grew and we repaid borrowings  we recorded a thousand increase in interest income on securities over during  due to the very low interest rate environment  we recorded million in net amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investments 
this decreased to million in within our investment securities portfolio  we maintained a concentration of mortgage backed securities 
many of these securities were purchased at premiums to their par value 
as homeowners refinanced and prepaid their mortgages during due to the low interest rate environment  we received prepayments on these securities  which required us to record substantial amounts of amortization on the premiums 
during the level of homeowner refinancing decreased due to higher residential mortgage interest rates  resulting in a decrease in the amount of amortization recorded on this portfolio 
our yield on investment securities was in  versus in due to the rising interest rate environment during and the acquisition of the hsbc branches  we substantially increased the interest expense on our most interest rate sensitive deposits  namely money market and time accounts 
during  the interest expense on these two categories of deposits increased million 
throughout our competitors raised their deposit interest rates due to the higher national interest rate environment 
to remain competitive and retain our customer s deposit accounts  we also raised our deposit rates 
this rate increase  coupled with the hsbc branch acquisition and slight increases in less interest sensitive savings and now account interest rates  our total cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in  a basis point increase 
at december  the treasury yield curve was very flat 
the two year and the ten year treasury notes were both yielding 
this flat interest rate environment inhibits our ability to earn net interest income  since banks typically earn net interest income by procuring short term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows banks to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income 
if this flat interest rate environment persists  it may negatively impact our ability to increase net interest income for several quarters prospectively

this comprised of the net increase in interest income between the periods 
as mentioned above  we maintained an average variable rate loan portfolio of approximately million throughout as interest rates climbed during the interest rates and resultant yields on these loans increased 
in addition  during as loans matured or were repaid  they were replaced by new loans at higher rates of interest 
due to these factors  the amount of interest income recorded on loans due to changes in rate contributed an additional million to interest income between and the increase in the average volume of loans outstanding between and due to our hsbc branch acquisition and our loan production efforts contributed an additional million toward interest income between the periods 
during we recorded million of interest income on investment securities  as compared to million during  a thousand increase 
during  the yield on the investment securities portfolio improved primarily because we recorded a decrease in the net amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investments between the periods 
the increase in interest income on investment securities between the periods due to rate was thousand 
this was offset by a thousand decrease in interest income on investments securities due to a decrease in the average volume of investment securities outstanding between the periods 
during we recorded thousand of interest income from interest bearing deposits held at other banks 
this compares with thousand in  an thousand decrease 
during the course of and we had mature million of fdic insured certificates of deposit that were originally acquired during and in connection with an interest rate arbitrage wholesale leverage strategy 
interest rates were significantly higher in and than in and in addition  during the fourth quarter of we acquired million of fdic insured certificates of deposit as part of a wholesale leverage strategy consummated in connection with the hsbc branch acquisition 
the certificates of deposit acquired in the fourth quarter of were acquired at a much lower rate of interest than the certificates that had matured in connection with the interest arbitrage wholesale leverage strategy 
these activities resulted in a thousand decrease in interest income due to rate and a thousand increase in interest income due to an increase in the average volume between the periods 
k during we maintained an average balance in our federal funds sold account of million 
this compares to million during in addition  throughout and the federal open market committee raised the target federal funds rate by basis points thirteen basis point increases 
due to these changes  interest income on federal funds sold increased thousand between and  thousand due to an increase in rate and thousand due to the increase in volume of federal funds sold 
during the interest expense on all categories of our interest bearing deposits increased relative to the most significant increases between the periods were recorded on our most interest sensitive deposits  namely time and money market accounts 
this was due to both the rapidly rising short term interest rates throughout both periods and the hsbc branch acquisition consummated during the first quarter of the total increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits due to rate was million 
this compares to a net increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits due to volume of thousand 
between the periods  the average volume of savings  money market  and time accounts increased  while the average volume of now accounts decreased 
the decrease in now account volumes was principally due to a decrease in deposit balances in our electronic money management account  a consumer oriented deposit account 
the increase in the average volume of savings  money market and time accounts was principally due to the hsbc branch acquisition 
the total interest expense on our borrowings decreased from million in to million in  a thousand decrease 
during we repaid million of long term borrowings 
most of these borrowings were borrowed in periods when borrowing costs were greater than the rates that prevailed during although we re borrowed million of long term borrowings during  the rates of interest on these borrowings were lower than the rates of borrowings that were repaid 
provision for loan losses 
during we recorded a provision for loan losses of million  or of average total loans outstanding 
this compares to million  or of average total loans outstanding in the provision for loan losses increased in  as compared to  due to a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
during  net loan charge offs increased thousand or  from thousand or of average total loans outstanding in to million or of average total loans outstanding in similarly  during we experienced an increase in the level of our non performing loans 
at december  we had million of non performing loans outstanding versus million at december  this was a million or increase between the periods 
non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  commission income  investment security gains losses  income on bank owned life insurance  other service fees  and other income 
non interest income decreased modestly from million in to million in this represents a thousand or decrease 
increases in trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  other service fees  and other income  were negatively offset by a significant decrease in net investment security gains  a modest decrease in commission income and a slight decrease in bank owned life insurance income 
total trust fees increased during specifically  during we recorded total trust fees of million  as compared to million in  a thousand or increase 
the increase in trust fees between the periods was due to an increase in non recurring estate administration commissions and trust account termination fees  as well as an increase in general service fees on trust  custodial  and investment management accounts 
during we revised our trust account fee schedule 
accordingly  the increased fees imposed by the revised fee schedule impacted all of  as opposed to only a portion of fiscal in we recorded thousand in trust estate closing fees  as compared to thousand in service charges on deposit accounts increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
during the second half of  we increased certain penalty charges on checking accounts  the impact of which was recognized for the full year of versus only for a portion of in addition  due to the hsbc branch acquisition in the first quarter of  the number of demand deposit accounts upon which we were able to assess service charges increased year over year 
our commission income is generated from the bank s insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc 
during we recorded thousand of commission income  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
during our agency did not renew coverage on several large commercial property and casualty insurance accounts due to competitive factors 
in addition the agency s personal lines property and casualty book of business did not grow substantially between periods 
these two factors resulted in a net decrease in commission income 
during  we recognized net pre tax investment securities gains of thousand 
this was a thousand or decrease  as compared to in we recorded million in net pre tax investment securities gains 
during we sold million of available for sale investment securities and an additional million in k available for sale and held to maturity securities matured or were called 
by comparison  during we sold million of available for sale investment securities and had an additional in available for sale and held to maturity securities mature or be called 
the principal cash flows from matured  called  and sold investment securities and the realized gains generated from those principal cash flows were greater in than in due to historically low interest rates experienced during the income related to the increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance decreased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
during the insurance companies that underwrote our bank owned life insurance decreased the crediting rates to their policyholders because the yields on their investment securities portfolios generally declined during and as a result of the low interest rate environment 
other service fees are comprised of numerous types of fee income  including merchant credit card processing fees  residential mortgage commissions  official check and check cashing fees  travelers check sales  wire transfer fees  letter of credit fees  and other miscellaneous service charges  commissions  and fees 
other service fees increased substantially year over year 
during we recorded thousand in other service fees  versus thousand in  a thousand or increase 
the substantial majority of the increase in other services fees in was due to a substantial increase in mortgage commissions year over year 
during we increased our marketing efforts and streamlined our mortgage origination process to increase the volume of mortgages we originate as agent for a large regional bank based in the southeast 
these efforts  coupled with the low mortgage rates prevalent during most of  increased our mortgage origination fees by thousand  from thousand in to thousand in other income is comprised of numerous types of fee income  including investment services  lease income  safe deposit box income  title insurance agency income  rental of foreclosed real estate  and distributions from two insurance trusts  in which the bank participates 
other income increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand  or increase 
during  we recorded thousand of investment services income  as compared to thousand in  a thousand  or increase 
during  we hired a financial planning and investment management specialist and licensed eight additional employees to sell investment services 
the fee income improvements experienced in were the result of additional mutual fund  annuity  and investment securities sales generated by these employees 
in addition  during we recorded a thousand increase in other income due to the improved performance in a title insurance agency in which we hold an ownership interest 
during we recorded thousand of other income due to the title agency  as compared to thousand in this improvement was offset by a thousand decrease in the amount distributed from a credit life insurance trust in which we participate through our membership in the new york bankers association 
during we received a thousand distribution from this credit life insurance trust  versus thousand in non interest expense 
non interest expense is comprised of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing expense  professional fees  and other expense 
total non interest expense increased from million in to million in  a million or increase 
during  we acquired two branch offices from hsbc  opened a loan production office in syracuse  new york  converted our core computer operating system  and completed a few significant compliance related projects  including documenting and testing our internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the sarbanes oxley act section 
these efforts resulted in significant increases in several categories of non interest expense 
salaries expense increased significantly in total salaries expense in was million versus million in  a thousand or increase 
the thousand increase between periods was due to several factors 
to service the accounts acquired from hsbc we increased our teller and customer service staff by ten full time employees 
during the second quarter of we opened a loan production office in syracuse  new york  and hired two additional staff members 
in addition  throughout and we provided salary increases to various members of the company s staff for merit and cost of living purposes 
and finally  due to our core computer system conversion and our sarbanes oxley act section compliance efforts  we recorded thousand in increased overtime wages 
these increases were partially offset by a thousand reduction in salaries expense related to the company s profit sharing incentive and commission plans 
in employee benefits expense increased thousand or  from million in to million in although various components of benefits expense changed year over year  the increase was primarily attributable to three factors  namely group health insurance costs  fica expense  and retirement plan costs 
during  we experienced higher claims on our partially self insured group health insurance plan 
this resulted in a thousand increase in plan costs year over year 
in addition  during the expense associated with our pension plan increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand increase 
and finally  due to an increase in k salaries expense  our fica tax increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand increase 
on february   we froze our defined benefit pension plan and replaced it with a defined contribution k retirement plan 
under the frozen plan  no future benefits will accrue for the plan s participants 
we expect that the switch from the defined benefit retirement plan to the defined contribution k plan will reduce retirement benefit related expense by thousand in occupancy expense and furniture and fixture expense both increased during due to our expansion activities  increased utilities cost  and increased property taxes 
in we recorded total occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses of million 
this compares to million in  a thousand or increase 
during our utilities cost increased thousand due primarily to higher fuel prices 
our school and land taxes increased thousand or year over year due to increased property taxes assessed by the municipalities in which our main office and branch offices operate 
in addition  we acquired an office building in the hsbc branch acquisition 
and finally  building repair and maintenance costs due to increased snow removal costs and depreciation expense increased thousand and thousand  respectively  year over year 
computer service fees increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during the third quarter of  we converted our proprietary core computer operating system to a system more widely used throughout the banking industry 
to complete the conversion we incurred significant computer consulting fees to i convert existing data to the new system  ii build software interfaces between the core system and related ancillary computer systems  and iii set and test new system parameters 
in addition  to operate the new system s on an ongoing basis we entered into various software licensing agreements and maintenance contracts with several hardware and software computer system vendors 
advertising and marketing expense decreased thousand or in  from thousand in to thousand in during we recorded a significant increase in advertising and marketing expense to support our market expansion activities 
in addition  due to the low interest rate environment in  we increased the promotion expense related to variable rate home equity line of credit 
we reduced our expenditures on these marketing and advertising endeavors in due to our concentration on our computer conversion and compliance efforts 
professional fees increased thousand or in  from thousand in to thousand in the increase was principally due to a substantial increase in independent auditor fees and an accounting consultant related to our sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts 
other miscellaneous expenses include directors fees  fidelity insurance  the bank s occ assessment  fdic premiums and assessments  bad debt collection expenses  correspondent bank services  service expense related to the bank s accounts receivable financing service  charitable donations and customer relations  other losses  dues and memberships  office supplies  postage and shipping  subscriptions  telephone expense  employee travel and entertainment  software amortization  intangible asset amortization expense  goodwill impairment  oreo expenses  gain loss on the disposal of assets  minority interest expense  amex r listing fees  and several other miscellaneous expenses

income tax expense decreased from million in to million in  a thousand  or decrease 
the primary reason income tax expense decreased between the periods was due to a decrease in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
during and we recorded new york state income tax expense utilizing a statutory alternative minimum tax rate of 
this rate was used because new york state tax law has allowed us to claim a dividends paid deduction for dividends paid to the bank by its subsidiary  wilber reit  inc this section of new york state tax law  namely  article  may not be renewed in its current form  which would disallow the dividends paid deduction for taxable income earned in tax years beginning january  if this were to occur  our new york state income tax expense would increase in and beyond  negatively affecting the results of operations 
if passed  we expect the legislative change would increase our new york state income tax rate to

by comparison  in our investment securities portfolio generated million in interest income and yielded  a million reduction in interest income and basis point reduction in yield 
during  we experienced very rapid prepayments on the mortgage backed securities sector of our investment securities portfolio  requiring us to record a significant amount of amortization of premiums on our investment securities 
during we recorded a net amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investments of million 
this compares to million in  a thousand increase 
additionally  due to the high levels of prepayments and the low interest rate environment  we reinvested much of the investment securities proceeds in investment securities at investment yields below the investment yield on the maturing security  driving down our yields 
specifically  during and we received investment securities proceeds primarily due to prepayments totaling million  million in and million in the yield on the loan portfolio declined from in to in  a basis point decrease 
as existing loans matured and amortized throughout  they were replaced by new loans at lower rates of interest 
in spite of the decreased yields  the interest income on loans increased by thousand period over period due to a substantial increase in our average total loans outstanding 
average total loans outstanding were million in  as compared to million in  a million or increase period over period

during the fourth quarter of  we acquired million of fdic insured certificates of deposit as part of a wholesale leverage transaction 
the interest rate paid on these certificates of deposit was lower than the interest rates paid on the matured certificates  resulting in a decrease in our average yield on interest bearing bank balances in during the interest income earned on federal funds sold decreased  primarily due to a reduction in our average outstanding balances 
during  we maintained an average balance in federal funds sold of million  as compared to million in although the average yield on federal funds sold increased during the last two quarters of  our interest income decreased from thousand in to thousand in during we offset our decrease in earning asset yields by decreasing the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
specifically  the interest expenses and total cost of interest bearing liabilities was million and in  as compared to million and in  respectively

during  we recorded million of interest expense on time accounts 
this compares to million of interest expense on time accounts in  a thousand decrease 
during the weighted average interest rate on maturing certificates of deposit exceeded the rates of interest being paid on new and renewed certificates of deposit  primarily because the maturing certificates of deposit were initially issued at a time when market interest rates were higher

our interest expense and average cost of borrowings decreased during specifically  in our interest expense on borrowings was million  as compared to million in during and respectively  we repaid million and million of high cost borrowings 
these matured borrowings were replaced by million and million of new lower cost borrowings in and  respectively  which reduced the average cost of borrowed funds from in to in the cost of our money market accounts increased from in to in due to an increase in the day treasury bill rate during the majority of our money market account balances were deposited in our highest interest rate tier in  which was indexed weekly to the day treasury bill rate 
for this reason  as the day treasury bill rate increased during  as did our cost of money market deposit accounts 
rate and volume analysis 
during we were able to maintain our net interest income near the levels because we increased the volume of our earning assets and reduced the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
specifically  in net interest income decreased by thousand  from million in to million in the growth in the volume of our earning assets contributed an additional thousand in interest income in over  while the reduction in our interest bearing liability costs reduced interest expense by million 
these two factors combined nearly offset the decrease in interest income on earning assets of million due to a change in interest rates 
interest income on investment securities decreased million during  due to reduction in volume 
an increase in the average volume of securities contributed an additional thousand of interest income in  while a reduction in the yield on the securities portfolio decreased interest income by million 
during we experienced very rapid prepayments on our mortgage backed securities portfolio due to the low interest rates available on home mortgages 
during many homeowners refinanced or repaid their existing mortgage to lower their interest rate or move into a new home 
these rapid prepayments required us to amortize a significant portion of premiums paid by us to obtain these securities 
additionally  due to a high turnover rate on our investment securities portfolio in and  many of the securities purchased were purchased at yields below the yield on the maturing security 
the reduction in k interest income on the securities portfolio due to a change in interest rates was the largest contributing factor toward our decrease in net interest income 
interest income on loans increased thousand during changes in interest rates caused a thousand reduction in interest income  while an increase in the average volume of loans outstanding increased interest income by thousand 
although interest rates declined on loans during  we increased the interest income earned on loans by increasing loans outstanding 
interest income earned on interest bearing deposits at other banks decreased by thousand during a decrease in the average volume of interest bearing deposits reduced interest income by thousand  while a decrease in the average yield reduced interest income by thousand 
interest income on federal funds sold in decreased by thousand  from thousand in to thousand in the interest income earned on federal funds sold decreased by thousand due to a reduction in the average volume of federal funds sold during the year 
this reduction was partially offset by a thousand increase in interest income on federal funds sold due to the increase in the federal funds rate during the second half of during we experienced a significant reduction in interest expense due to a reduction in the rate and volume of time accounts 
during higher rate certificates of deposit were replaced by new certificates of deposit at lower rates 
interest expense on time accounts decreased thousand in  as compared to interest expense decreased thousand as a result of a reduction in rates and thousand as a result of a reduction in volume 
the average cost of time deposits was in  as compared to in  while the average volume of time deposits decreased from million in to million in savings accounts  now accounts  and borrowings experienced similar rate and volume patterns in in the average balances of all three of these categories of interest bearing liabilities increased  while the average interest rate paid decreased 
the increase in the average balances resulted in additional interest expense due to a change in volume  while the change in the rates decreased interest expense 
on the savings accounts  interest expense decreased thousand due to a thousand reduction in interest expense due to a change in rates  offset by a thousand increase in interest expense due to an increase in the average volume 
on the now accounts  interest expense decreased thousand due to a thousand reduction in interest expense due to a change in rates  offset by a thousand increase in interest expense due to an increase in the average volume 
and finally  on borrowings  interest expense decreased thousand due to a thousand reduction in interest expense due to a change in rates  offset by a thousand increase in interest expense due to an increase in the average volume 
interest expense on our money market accounts increased thousand in over interest expense increased thousand due to an increase in interest rates paid on money market accounts  while interest expense decreased thousand due to a reduction in the volume of money market accounts 
the majority of our money market accounts are indexed to the day treasury bill rate  which increased during provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million or of average total loans outstanding in  as compared to million or of average total loans outstanding in this was a thousand or decrease 
the provision for loan losses decreased in as compared to due to a general improvement in the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
during net loan charge offs decreased by thousand or  from million or of average loans outstanding in to thousand or of average loans outstanding in similarly  during we experienced a reduction in the level of our non performing loans 
at december   we had million of non performing loans outstanding versus million at december  this was a thousand or decrease between the periods 
delinquent loans also decreased between the periods 
at december   we had million of loans or of total loans outstanding that were or more days past due excluding loans placed on non accrual status 
by comparison  at december   we had million or of total loans outstanding that were or more days past due excluding loans placed on non accrual status 
the potential problem loans did not change significantly between the periods 
potential problem loans increased slightly between the periods  from million or of total loans outstanding at december   to million or of total loans outstanding at december  non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  commission income  investment security gains losses  income on bank owned life insurance  other service fees  and other income 
non interest income decreased slightly from million in to million in this represents a thousand or decrease 
increases in service charges on deposit accounts and commissions income were negatively offset by decreases in trust fees  investment security gains  bank owned life insurance income  other service fees  and other income 
k total trust fees decreased slightly in specifically  trust fees totaled million in  as compared to million in  a thousand or decrease 
the decrease in trust fees between the periods was primarily due to a reduction in non recurring closing fees  including estate administration commissions and trust account termination fees 
in we recorded thousand in trust estate closing fees  as compared to thousand in we partially offset this decline in by recording a thousand increase in fees on other trusts  custodial and investment management accounts 
although there was a decrease in the period end market value of trust accounts between december  and december   the average value of trust assets administered by the bank increased  driving the increase in our trust fees 
the decrease in the period end market value of trust accounts between the periods was primarily due to the reduction in value of a single trust account totaling approximately million 
service charges on deposit accounts increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
during the second half of  we increased certain penalty charges on checking accounts 
this  in addition to a higher average balance of demand deposit accounts in versus  increased our service charge income year over year 
our commission income is generated from the bank s insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc 
during we increased the number of policies through additional sales to customers and purchased a two thirds interest in a small specialty lines insurance agency located in clifton park  new york 
these factors increased our commission income from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during we recorded net pre tax investment securities gains of million on the call and sale of investment securities 
this was a thousand or decrease as compared to in we recorded million in net pre tax investment securities gains 
during we sold million of available for sale investment securities and had an additional million in available for sale and held to maturity securities mature or be called as interest rates declined 
our corporate securities were sold during to reduce the credit risk in our investment securities portfolio 
the income related to the increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance decreased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
during the insurance companies decreased the crediting rates for their policyholders because yields decreased on their investment securities portfolios as a result of the low interest rate environment 
other service fees are comprised of numerous types of fee income  including merchant credit card processing fees  residential mortgage origination fees  official check and check cashing fees  travelers check sales  wire transfer fees  letter of credit fees  and other miscellaneous service charges  commissions  and fees 
other service fees decreased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
during the second quarter of  we lost our largest merchant credit card customer  which decreased fees related to this service from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand decrease 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our mortgage loan fees 
during  we increased our marketing efforts and origination process to increase the volume of mortgages we originate as agent for another bank 
these efforts  coupled with the low mortgage rates  increased our mortgage loan fees by thousand  from thousand in to thousand in other income is comprised of numerous types of fee income  including investment services  lease income  safe deposit box income  title insurance agency income  rental of foreclosed real estate  and distributions from two insurance trusts  in which the bank participates 
other income decreased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
during we recorded thousand of investment services income  as compared to thousand in  a thousand increase 
during we hired a financial planning and investment management specialist and licensed eight additional employees to sell investment services 
the fee income improvements experienced in were the result of additional mutual fund  annuity  and investment securities sales generated by these employees 
these improvements were negatively offset by a thousand decrease in income related to the bank s investment in new york bankers title agency east and a thousand net decrease in other miscellaneous income items 
non interest expense 
non interest expenses are comprised of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing expense  professional fees  and other expense 
total non interest expense increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
salaries expense decreased slightly in specifically  total salaries expense was million in  as compared to million in  a thousand or decrease 
although the net decrease in salaries was modest in  there were several positive and negative factors  which contributed to the net change 
base salaries  overtime  and k employee incentive pay increased by thousand  or in  from million in to million in due to annual wage and salary adjustments for existing employees and expansion activities  including the addition of new employees 
this increase was offset by a thousand decrease in salaries expense recorded between the periods due to our deferred compensation plan for executives 
under the plan  participants may defer a portion of their salary into the plan 
the deferred amounts are then invested in either phantom stock units of the company or other permissible investments allowed under the plan 
the deferred amounts allocated to phantom stock units are indexed to the economic performance of the company s common stock with changes recorded to salaries expense 
during  we recorded thousand of expense due to the phantom stock units component of the plan  as compared to thousand during  a thousand decrease 
similarly  during we recorded thousand of expense due to the other investments held by the plan  as compared to thousand in  an thousand decrease 
during  we recorded million of employee benefits expense  as compared to million in  an thousand or increase between the periods 
the net increase in benefits expense  although modest  was due to several positive and negative factors 
our group health insurance expenses increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase due to increased claims and plan administration costs 
in addition  during we recorded increases in fica expense due to increased salaries expense  group life insurance  group disability  employee education  supplemental executive retirement plan benefits  and other benefits totaling thousand 
these increases were partially offset by a thousand decrease in retirement plan expenses and a thousand decrease in workers compensation expense between the periods 
our net occupancy expense on bank premises increased thousand or  from million in to million in during  building repairs  utilities  insurance  building rental expense  school and land taxes  and depreciation expense all increased due to general inflationary type increases and the establishment of a new full service branch office in johnson city broome county  new york  and a representative loan production office in kingston ulster county  new york 
furniture and equipment expense decreased thousand or in  from thousand in to thousand in during  equipment maintenance and repair costs and depreciation expense declined by thousand and thousand respectively 
during  we recorded a significant increase in computer service fees 
total computer service fees were thousand in  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during the third quarter of  we terminated a contract to convert our core computer processing system 
at that time we were carrying thousand of prepaid conversion costs in other assets  which we expensed to computer service fees 
the remaining thousand in computer service fee increases were incurred as the result of implementing new computer systems and data conversion costs related to increased information technology system demands and the pending core computer system conversion scheduled for the second quarter of marketing and advertising expense increased thousand or in  from thousand in to thousand in our market expansion activities  increased product promotions and an increased level of participation in community events drove the increase in our marketing and advertising expense in professional fees increased by thousand or in  from thousand in to thousand in in we expanded the scope of our loan review process 
we recorded thousand of additional professional fees expense for this purpose 
other various professional fees increases account for the remaining of professional fees increases

income tax expense decreased from million in to million in  a thousand  or decrease 
the decrease in the income tax expense was primarily due to a net increase in tax exempt income of thousand in and decreased pre tax earnings 
our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
our income tax expense and effective tax rate were reduced in as well as in prior years because current new york state tax law allows us to claim a dividends paid deduction for dividends paid to the bank by its subsidiary  wilber reit  inc legislation has been proposed at the new york state level  which would change the tax treatment of dividends paid by real estate investment trusts  such as wilber reit  inc if the law is passed in its current form with an effective date of january   our annual income tax expense would increase by approximately thousand  increasing our effective tax rate to e 
liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations in the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers  to fund loans to customers  and to fund our current and planned expenditures 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position 
accordingly  we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis through our daily funds management process 
this includes o maintaining the appropriate levels of currency throughout our branch system to meet the daily cash needs of our customers  o balancing our mandated deposit or reserve requirements at the federal reserve bank of new york  o maintaining adequate cash balances at our correspondent banks  and o assuring that adequate levels of federal funds sold  liquid assets  and borrowing resources are available to meet obligations  including reasonably anticipated daily fluctuations 
in addition to the daily funds management process  we also monitor certain liquidity ratios and complete a liquidity assessment every days to estimate current and future sources and uses of liquidity 
the day sources and uses assessment is reviewed by our alco 
the alco  based on this assessment and other data  determines our future funding or investment needs and strategies 
the results of the day sources and uses assessment is reported to the board of directors of the bank quarterly 
we were in compliance with all of its internal liquidity policy limits at december k  and december  the following list represents the sources of funds available to meet our liquidity requirements 
our primary sources of funds are denoted by an asterisk 
source of funding o currency o federal reserve and correspondent bank balances o federal funds sold o loan and investment principal and interest payments o investment security maturities and calls o demand deposits now accounts o savings money market deposits o certificates of deposit and other time deposits o repurchase agreements o fhlbny advances lines of credit o sale of available for sale investment securities o brokered deposits o correspondent lines of credit o fed 
reserve discount window borrowings o sale of loans o proceeds from issuance of equity securities o branch acquisition o cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance our liquidity position did not materially change between december  and december  we maintained adequate amounts of cash and cash equivalents at both period ends to meet anticipated short term funding needs 
in addition  our ability to meet unanticipated funding needs was strong 
at december  we maintained million of available for sale investment securities that could be pledged for borrowings or sold to meet unanticipated funding needs 
this compares to million at december  in addition  we maintained a million credit facility at a correspondent bank  in the event we needed to borrow federal funds on an overnight basis 
this compares to million at december  in addition  at december  and december   our total loan to total asset ratio of and  respectively  were low relative to our comparative peer group of financial institutions 
the following table summarizes several of our key liquidity measures for the periods stated table of liquidity measures liquidity measure december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents   available for sale investment securities at estimated fair value less securities pledged for   state and municipal deposits and borrowings total loan to total asset ratio fhlbny remaining borrowing capacity   available correspondent bank lines of credit   our commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit increased by million or between december  and december  at december  commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit were million  as compared to million at december  this increase was due to both an increase in home equity line of credit commitments assumed during the hsbc branch acquisition and additional commercial loan commitments 
our experience indicates that draws on the commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit do not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  are not expected to materially impact our liquidity prospectively 
we recognize that deposit flows and loan and investment prepayment activity are affected by the level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  and other factors 
based on our deposit retention experience  anticipated levels of regional economic activity  particularly moderate levels of loan demand within our primary market k area  and current pricing strategies  we anticipate that we will have sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our current funding commitments for several quarters prospectively

capital resources and dividends the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by our management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to stockholders while retaining a sufficient capital base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
at december  our stockholders equity was million  a thousand or increase over december  stockholders equity of million 
the slight increase in stockholders equity was due to an increase in retained earnings of million offset by a million reduction in other comprehensive income and a thousand increase in treasury stock 
the company and the bank are both subject to regulatory capital guidelines 
under these guidelines  as established by federal bank regulators  to be adequately capitalized the company and the bank must both maintain the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets at and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
tier capital is comprised of stockholders equity  less intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income 
total capital  for this risk based capital standard  includes tier capital plus the company s allowance for loan losses 
similarly  for the bank to be considered well capitalized  it must maintain a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of and a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
the company exceeded all capital adequacy guidelines and the bank exceeded all well capitalized guidelines at december   and december  the company s tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at december   were and  respectively 
this compares to and  respectively  at december  additional details regarding the company s and the bank s capital ratios are set forth in note of the company s consolidated financial statements located in part ii  item  of this document 
the principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company has been dividends declared and paid to the company by its subsidiary bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its subsidiaries as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its stockholders 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiary to the company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of the company and the bank to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines  and applicable laws

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market conditions  including rates and prices  will reduce earnings and make the company less valuable 
we are primarily exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates 
this risk is called interest rate risk and is an inherent component of risk for all banks 
the risk occurs because we pay interest on deposits and borrowed funds at varying rates and terms  while receiving interest income on loans and investments with different rates and terms 
as a result  our earnings and the imputed economic value of assets and liabilities are subject to potentially significant fluctuations as interest rates rise and fall 
our objective is to minimize the fluctuation in net interest margin and net interest income caused by anticipated and unanticipated changes in interest rates 
ultimately  the company s board of directors is responsible for monitoring and managing market and interest rate risk 
the board accomplishes this objective by annually reviewing and approving an asset and liability management policy  which establishes broad risk limits and delegates responsibility to carry out asset and liability oversight and control to the directors loan and investment committee and management s asset and liability committee alco 
we manage a few different forms of interest rate risk 
the first is mismatch risk  which involves the mismatch of maturities of fixed rate assets and liabilities 
the second is basis risk 
basis risk is the risk associated with non correlated changes in different interest rates 
for example  we price many of our adjustable rate commercial loans an asset using the prime rate as a basis  while some of our deposit accounts a liability are tied to treasury security yields 
in a given k timeframe  the prime rate might decrease while a particular treasury security might only decrease 
if this were to occur  our yield on prime based commercial loans would decrease by  while the cost of deposits might only decrease by  negatively affecting net interest income and net interest margin 
the third risk is option risk 
option risk generally appears in the form of prepayment volatility on residential mortgages  commercial and commercial real estate loans  consumer loans  mortgage backed securities  and callable agency or municipal investment securities 
the bank s customers generally have alternative financing sources or options to refinance their existing debt obligations with other financial institutions 
when interest rates decrease  many of these customers exercise this option and refinance at other institutions and prepay their loans with us  forcing us to reinvest the prepaid funds in lower yielding investments and loans 
the same type of refinancing activity also accelerates principal payments on mortgage backed securities held by the bank 
municipal investment securities and agency securities are issued with specified call dates and call prices and are typically exercised by the issuer when interest rates on comparable maturity securities are lower than the current coupon rate on the security 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objective of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
this means that prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact that alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earnings and the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based on numerous assumptions including  but not limited to the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit retention rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and local market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions  including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results will differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from a parallel shift in all market interest rates 
the shift in interest rates is assumed to occur in monthly increments of per month until the full shift is complete 
in other words  we assume it will take months for a shift to take place 
this is also known as a ramped interest rate shock 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the month period beginning january  and ending december   under ramped shock scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity table interest rates dollars in thousands projected change in projected projected net interest projected dollar percentage income as a annualized change change in percent of interest net in net net total rate shock prime interest interest interest stockholders rate income income income equity no change  under a ramped interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at a rate of per month 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the bank s alco and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by thousand or of total stockholders equity k in a ramped interest rate shock and million or of total stockholders equity in a ramped interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline  which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or ramped interest rate shock to of the company s total equity capital 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by general market conditions and customer demand 
but generally  we try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities so that we can adjust the mix and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility 
we also purchase investments for the securities portfolio and structure borrowings from the fhlbny to offset interest rate risk taken in the loan portfolio 
we also offer adjustable rate loan and deposit products that change as interest rates change 
approximately of our total assets at december  were invested in adjustable rate loans and investments 
at december  the treasury yield curve was very flat 
the two year and the ten year treasury note were both yielding 
this flat interest rate environment inhibits our ability to earn net interest income  since banks typically earn net interest income by procuring short term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows bank s to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income 
if this flat interest rate environment persists  it may negatively impact our ability to increase net interest income for several quarters prospectively
