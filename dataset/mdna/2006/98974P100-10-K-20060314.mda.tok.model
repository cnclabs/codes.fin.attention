risk factors in these risk factors  we  us  our  and zixcorp refer to zix corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years and we continue to use significant amounts of cash for our business operations  which could result in us having insufficient cash to fund our operations under our current business plan 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years 
our businesses operate in emerging markets and developing these businesses is costly and the market is highly competitive 
emerging market businesses like ours involve risks and uncertainties  
table of contents and there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts 
our liquidity and capital resources remain limited 
there can be no assurance that our liquidity or capital resource position would allow us to continue to pursue our current business strategy after the proceeds from the issuance of our august private placement are expended 
as a result  we could be forced to further augment our cash position through additional cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings  or a combination of these actions 
there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital if and when needed or on favorable terms 
if we cannot raise capital  we might have to alter our business model 
any of these adverse events could substantially diminish the value of our common stock 
the market may not broadly accept our secure e messaging and e prescribing solutions and services  which would prevent us from operating profitably 
we must be able to achieve broad market acceptance for our secure e messaging and e prescribing solutions and services  at a price that provides an acceptable rate of return relative to our costs in order to operate profitably 
we have not yet been able to do this 
furthermore  pocketscript  our e prescribing service  operates in an emerging market 
there is no assurance that this market will develop sufficiently to enable us to operate our pocketscript business profitably 
there is no assurance that any of our services will become generally accepted or that they will be compatible with any standards that become generally accepted  nor is there any assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate these businesses profitably 
failure to enter into additional or to maintain existing sponsorship agreements for our pocketscript e prescribing service and generate other revenue opportunities from pocketscript could harm our business 
our pocketscript business has incurred significant operating losses 
through december   significant orders for our pocketscript e prescribing service came from sponsorship agreements with healthcare payors 
under our payor sponsorship business model  we deploy pocketscript to the end user physician and provide the end user physician a subscription to use the service in return for payments from the healthcare payor 
these payments are in the form of guaranteed payments from the healthcare payor or contingent payments that are based on contractually specified performance metrics 
in some cases  these contingent payments could represent a substantial portion of the revenue opportunity under the contract 
substantially all of the end user physicians who are using the pocketscript service and for whom we are currently recognizing revenue are doing so under a subscription arrangement that has been paid for by a healthcare payor 
although we believe that physicians will pay to use the pocketscript service following the one year of service paid for by the healthcare payors or that healthcare payors will extend their sponsorship  there is no assurance that they will do so 
in addition  we obtain revenue from prescription transaction fees from pharmacy benefit managers and others with respect to the electronic prescriptions processed through our e prescribing service 
increasing our active physician user base and increasing prescription transaction fees are critical to the success of our plan to achieve profitability in our e prescribing business 
failure to sign follow on orders with additional healthcare payors from whom a significant portion of our revenues are received or sign new sponsorship agreements with other payors in the coming months  or generate significant revenue from contingent payments  or maintain and identify other revenue opportunities for our e prescribing services  such as add on applications or prescription transaction fees  and or new uses for the transaction data itself  will prevent us from achieving significant revenues from our e prescribing services 
healthcare providers may fail to adopt our pocketscript service 
our pocketscript e prescribing service is targeted to the emerging market for providing secure communications among healthcare providers to deliver information in an efficient  economical manner 
this is an emerging market  and the success of pocketscript is dependent  in large measure  on physicians changing the manner in which they write prescriptions 
our challenge is to make this new business attractive to physicians  and ultimately  profitable 
to do so has required  and will require  us to invest significant resources  including significant amounts of cash 
there is no assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate the pocketscript business profitably 

table of contents failure to significantly increase our base of pocketscript users or obtain significant prescription transaction fees may result in failure to achieve the critical mass of physicians and revenue to build a successful business 
we incur significant up front costs in connection with initially establishing our pocketscript e prescribing service with the physician users 
under our current business model  third party payors typically pay all or a majority of the variable costs of initially establishing our e prescribing service  and a limited amount of the overhead costs associated with our e prescribing business 
our plan is to obtain additional revenues in the form of recurring annual subscription fees to use our e prescribing service  either paid by the third party payors or the physicians 
in addition  we must obtain additional revenues from prescription transaction fees to operate this line of business profitably 
as our base of physician users grows through additional physicians subscribing to use our service and the retention of existing users  we hope to generate enough revenue to become profitable in this line of business 
increasing our physician user base and increasing prescription transaction fees are critical to the success of this plan 
the preponderance of the prescription transaction fees that we currently receive are from two pharmacy benefit managers  which manage the prescription benefits for their health plan customers  and one electronic script aggregator  which receives scripts written by the physician user of our pocketscript e prescribing service and transmits them via electronic data interchange to retail pharmacies 
our contracts with these persons are short term  meaning that the other party could cancel the contract and require us to renegotiate the contract at lower fee levels or on other unfavorable terms and conditions 
these unfavorable terms and conditions could increase our costs and could require us to revise our business model 
in sum  there is no assurance as to whether  or how quickly  we will be able to increase our user base or prescription transaction fees to such a level that would enable this line of business to operate profitably 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  or raise additional capital 
competition in our businesses is expected to increase  which could cause our business to fail 
our zix branded solutions and services are targeted to the secure e messaging services market 
our pocketscript business is targeted to the emerging market for electronic prescriptions 
as the public s and governmental authorities awareness about the need for privacy and security of electronic communications has increased over the past few years  an increasing number of competitors have entered the market 
there are many large  well funded participants in the information technology security industry  however  few currently participate in the secure e messaging services market in which our zix branded solutions and services compete 
our service offerings are focused on the secure communications market  including secure e messaging 
companies that compete with our zix branded secure e messaging business include content management and secure delivery companies  such as tumbleweed communications corp  and other secure delivery participants  such as voltage security  postx  pgp corporation  certified mail  authentica  and sigaba corporation 
in addition  we face competition from vendors of internet server appliances  operating systems  networking hardware  network management solutions  and security software  many of which now  or may in the future  develop or bundle secure e messaging into their products 
our pocketscript e prescribing service applies the benefits of e messaging to the medical prescription process by enabling providers to write and transmit prescriptions electronically directly to the pharmacy 
participants in the e prescribing space include allscripts healthcare solutions  medplus  dr 
first  inc  instantdx llc  and iscribe 
competition from these companies and from vendors in related areas  such as electronic medical records vendors who are expected to include e prescribing services as an element of their service offering is expected to increase 
we may face increased competition as these competitors partner with others or develop new solution and service offerings to expand the functionality that they can offer to their customers 
our competitors may  over time  develop new technologies that are perceived as being more secure  effective  or cost efficient than our own 
these competitors could successfully garner a significant share of the market  to the exclusion of our company 
furthermore  increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins  or the failure of our business to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any one of which could harm our business 
our inability to successfully and timely develop and introduce new e messaging and e prescribing services and related services and to implement technological changes could harm our business 
the evolving nature of the secure e messaging and e prescribing businesses require us to continually develop and introduce new and related solutions and services and to improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing solutions and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 

table of contents we have under development new feature sets for our secure e messaging and e prescribing businesses 
we may also introduce new services 
the success of new or enhanced features and services depends on several factors primarily market acceptance 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing new or enhanced features and services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 
this could harm our business 
if the market for secure e messaging and e prescribing services and related services does not continue to grow  demand for our solutions and services will be adversely affected 
the market for secure e messaging is a developing market 
the market for e prescribing is an emerging market 
continued growth of the secure e messaging and e prescribing services markets will depend  to a large extent  on the market recognizing the need for secure electronic communications  such as email encryption and e prescribing 
failure of these markets to grow would harm our business 
future asset impairments could affect our financial results 
on september   we sold our other mydoconline service  dr 
chart  a web based communication tool that connects healthcare providers and hospital based laboratories by allowing doctors to initiate lab orders  check medical necessity compliance  and view results rapidly and accurately using a secure internet connection 
the sale of the dr 
chart service resulted in zixcorp recognizing a one time  non cash loss from the sale in the third quarter of totaling million 
the primary factor in determining the amount of the loss was the inclusion of the full amount of goodwill associated with the purchase of mydoconline  totaling million 
as of december   we have million of goodwill on our balance sheet relating to the esecure product line 
goodwill is evaluated at least on an annual basis or whenever there is a reason to question if the goodwill values are impaired 
we also have million of property and other long lived assets 
the carrying value of these assets are evaluated whenever there is reason to question if the values are impaired 
future events could impact the valuation of goodwill and long lived assets 
it is possible that we may incur further charges for other asset impairments in the future as we evaluate the prospects of our various lines of business and the use of technologies acquired by us from third parties via asset acquisitions in and capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project  and we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems to meet increased use  which would result in reduced revenues 
while we have ample through put capacity to handle our customers requirements for the medium term  at some point we may be required to materially expand and or upgrade our technology and network hardware and software 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage on our network  particularly since we have significantly expanded our potential customer base by the growing use of our pocketscript service  which is supported by our zixdata center tm 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software capabilities in a timely manner to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
if we do not timely and appropriately expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software  we may lose customers and revenues 
security interruptions to our data centers could disrupt our business  and any security breaches could expose us to liability and negatively impact customer demand for our solutions and services 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our data centers currently  our zixdata center located in dallas  texas  and the austin  texas data center used for fail over and business continuity services 
we must protect these centers from loss  damage  or interruption caused by fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  or other events beyond our control 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our data centers operations could materially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to issue digitally signed certified time stamps and public encryption codes in connection with our zix branded solutions and services and to support the pocketscript e prescribing service depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections between customers and our data centers 
we depend on internet service providers efficiently operating these connections 
these providers have experienced periodic operational problems or outages in the past 
any of these problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction 

table of contents furthermore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and the market perceives them to be secure 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
in addition  we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data  resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events  therefore  it is possible that we may have to use additional resources to address these problems 
secure messages sent through our zixport and zixmessage center tm messaging portals  in connection with the operation of our secure e messaging services  include personal healthcare information as well as personal financial information 
this information will reside  for a user specified period of time  in our secure data center network  and individual prescription histories transmitted through our pocketscript e prescribing system and other personally identifiable health care information will reside in our secure data center network 
federal and state laws impose significant financial penalties for unauthorized disclosure of personal information 
exposure of this information  resulting from any physical or electronic break ins or other security breaches or compromises of this information  could expose us to significant liability  and customers could be reluctant to use our internet related services 
pending litigation could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition 
beginning in early september  several purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the purported class action lawsuits seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of purchasers of zixcorp s common stock between october  and may  the purported shareholder class action lawsuits allege that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements and or omissions in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  during this time period 
also  three purported shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the shareholder derivative lawsuits relate to the allegedly materially false and misleading statements and or omissions that are the subject of the purported shareholder class action lawsuits 
the derivative lawsuits name zixcorp as a nominal defendant and as actual defendants the individuals named in the purported shareholder class action lawsuits mentioned above and others 
the suits seek to require zixcorp to initiate legal action for unspecified damages against the individual defendants named in the purported shareholder class action lawsuits 
the suits also allege breaches of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  insider selling  and misappropriation of information  and seek contribution and indemnification against the individual defendants 
these lawsuits may require significant management time and attention and could result in significant legal expenses 
while we believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously  we are unable to predict the scope or outcome of these matters and quantify their eventual impact  if any  on our company 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flow  and financial condition 
we maintain insurance that may limit our financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome  should we not prevail  for claims covered by the insurance coverage 
we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend our intellectual property rights or defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing services or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to develop or license the necessary technology 
furthermore  it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property  thus enabling them to effectively compete against us 
defects or errors in our services could harm our business 
we subject our solutions and services to quality assurance testing prior to release 
regardless of the quality assurance testing  any of our solutions could contain undetected defects or errors 
in particular  our pocketscript system is used to transmit prescriptions 
defects or errors in our pocketscript system could result in inaccurate prescriptions being generated  which could result in injury or death to patients 
undetected defects or errors could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs  or increased service and warranty costs 
any one of these could prevent us from implementing our business model and achieving the revenues we need to 
table of contents operate profitably 
public key cryptography technology is subject to risks 
our zix branded solutions and services and the pocketscript e prescribing service employ  and future solutions and services may employ  public key cryptography technology 
with public key cryptography technology  a public key and a private key are used to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends  in large measure  on the integrity of the private key  which is dependent  in part  on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the integrity of the private key is predicated on the assumption that it is difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
should methods be developed that make it easier to derive the private key  the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated and such services could become unmarketable 
this could require us to make significant changes to our services  which could damage our reputation and otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  there have been public reports of the successful decryption of certain encrypted messages 
this or related publicity could adversely affect public perception of the security afforded by public key cryptography technology  which could harm our business 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team including our chairman  ceo  and president  richard d 
spurr  and our vice president of finance and administration  cfo  and treasurer  bradley c 
almond  and their direct reports and other key employees  particularly highly skilled technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate these individuals 
there are no binding agreements with any of our employees that prevent them from leaving our company at any time 
there is competition for these personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain  and motivate key employees could harm our business 
we rely on third parties 
if critical services and products that we source from third parties were to no longer be made available to us or at a considerably higher price than we currently pay for them  and suitable alternatives could not be found  our business could be harmed 
for certain elements of our service offerings  we sometimes rely on the products and services of third parties under contracts 
those third parties are not under our control beyond the terms of their agreements and  therefore  should they elect to withhold their products or services or significantly raise their prices  we could be damaged financially in lower returns on sales and a lessening of competitive advantages if suitable alternatives could not be found in a reasonable period of time 
we could be affected by government regulation 
exports of software solutions and services using encryption technology  such as our zix branded solutions and services  are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our solutions and services to almost all countries  the list of countries to which our solutions and services cannot be exported could be revised in the future 
furthermore  some countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption solutions and services  such as ours 
failure to obtain the required governmental approvals would preclude the sale or use of our solutions and services in international markets 
furthermore  boards of pharmacy in the various states in which our pocketscript business operates regulate the process by which physicians write prescriptions 
while regulations in the states in which this business currently operates generally permit the electronic writing of prescriptions  such regulations could be revised in the future 
moreover  regulations in states in which our pocketscript business does not currently operate may not be as favorable and may impede our ability to develop business in these states 
the federal government has proposed regulations to create an exception to the prohibition on physicians referrals to health care entities with which they have financial relationships for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  to be codified at cfr v  and an exception to the related federal health care anti kickback rules for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  to be codified at cfr x 
the purpose of the proposed regulations is to encourage physicians to use electronic prescribing systems to create and deliver prescriptions to the pharmacy 
the proposed regulations seek to accomplish this purpose by creating certain safe harbors that are intended to encourage health care entities  such as health insurance companies and hospitals  to provide financial incentives to physicians to use electronic prescribing systems 
there is no assurance that the final regulations will actually encourage the use of electronic prescribing systems 
furthermore  the final regulations could provide other participants in the market a competitive advantage or could have currently unforeseen consequences that harm our business 

table of contents also  future state or federal regulation could mandate standards for the electronic writing of prescriptions or for the secure electronic transmittal of personal health information through the internet that our technology and systems do not comply with  which would require us to modify our technology and systems 
the costs of compliance could be substantial 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
our stock price may decrease as a result of the dilutive effect caused by the additional number of shares that may become available in the market due to the issuances of our common stock in connection with the capital funding and acquisition transactions we completed over the last few years 
as of february   there was a short position in our common stock of  shares  which may affect the volatility of our stock price 
one investor owns a large percentage of our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of actions 
george w 
haywood and an ira for the benefit of mr 
haywood beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock measured as of february  
therefore  mr 
haywood could exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors 
mr 
haywood s interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
this concentration of ownership and voting power may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business 
we have a certain amount of debt and may be unable to service or refinance this debt  or servicing this debt may restrict cash available for our business operations  or complying with the covenants of the debt could restrict certain desired business actions 
as of december  our total outstanding indebtedness  including capital leases  requires us to make payments totaling million payable over the next two years  excluding interest 
this level of debt could have negative consequences 
for example  it could result in our inability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our outstanding convertible notes  which among other things  require us to maintain specified cash levels and limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets  which could in turn result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our operations  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal payments on our debt or to meet required cash reserves  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital  capital investments  and other business activities  increase our vulnerability to adverse industry and general economic conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital investments  and other business activities  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are commercially reasonable  and limit our flexibility to plan for  and react to  changes in our business and our industry 
we have a significant amount of convertible securities and related warrants outstanding and may issue additional equity securities in the future 
conversion or redemption of our outstanding convertible note into our common stock  exercise of the outstanding warrants  and future issuances or conversion of other securities will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
the outstanding balance of our convertible promissory note was million at december  per the terms of our convertible note  the full amount outstanding may be converted by the holders at a conversion price of per share 
if fully converted at this price  we could be obligated to issue an additional  shares of our common stock  assuming shareholder approval 
we have also issued warrants covering  shares of our common stock to the current and former holders of the convertible notes and additional warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were issued to the placement agent for the transaction 
including these warrants  we have outstanding warrants and options  including options held by our employees  covering 
table of contents approximately million shares of our common stock with exercise prices ranging from to 
the issuances of shares of common stock in respect of the convertible note and these warrants and options would result in a substantial voting dilution of our current shareholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or redemption of the notes or exercise of the warrants and options could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in the future  we may determine to seek additional capital funding or to acquire additional businesses  which could involve the issuance of one or more types of equity securities  including convertible debt  common and convertible preferred stock  and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
such equity securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
in addition  we incent our employees and attract new employees by issuing shares of our common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
the interest of our existing shareholders may be diluted by any equity securities issued in capital funding financings or business acquisitions and would be diluted by any such future share issuances and stock option grants to employees 
finally  as a result of the anti dilution provisions of the warrants described above  we may be obligated to register with the sec additional shares of common stock issuable to the warrant holders for public resale 
we may have liability for indemnification claims arising from the sale of our web inspector  message inspector  and dr 
chart product lines 
we disposed of our web inspector and message inspector product lines in march and our dr 
chart product line in september in selling those products  we agreed to provide customary indemnification to the purchasers of those businesses for breaches of representations and warranties  covenants  and other specified matters 
indemnification claims could be asserted against us with respect to these matters 
the company has evaluated these indemnifications and determined that no accrual is currently necessary 
we may encounter other risks 
we may encounter other unanticipated risks and uncertainties in the markets we serve or in developing new services  and we cannot give assurance that we will be successful in responding to any unanticipated risks or uncertainties 
there are no assurances that we will be successful or that we will not encounter other  and even unanticipated  risks 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in our periodic filings with the sec

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in a single reporting segment  providing solutions that protect  manage and deliver sensitive electronic information 
these solutions are grouped into two product lines esecure and ehealth 
esecure is a comprehensive suite of secure messaging solutions which allow an enterprise to use policy driven rules to determine which emails need to be sent securely in order to comply with regulations or corporate policy 
the esecure portfolio of commercial products and services include zixmail  a desktop solution for encrypting and securely delivering email  zixvpm virtual private messenger  an e messaging gateway solution that provides company wide privacy protection for inbound and outbound email communications  zixauditor  an assessment service used to analyze email traffic patterns and monitor compliance with corporate and regulatory policies  and zixport  a secure web messaging portal 
further  the company first targeted the healthcare sector  where the legislated mandates of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  a law that requires protected health information to be safeguarded over open networks  are driving demand 
the privacy regulations for this law took effect in april and the security regulations took effect in april the company continues to make a strategic effort to expand its direct sales and marketing outside of its core market of health care into insurance and finance  as well as made efforts to expand the company s distribution and reseller networks  which target non health care vertical markets 
esecure had previously included the mi wi products  previously acquired in the elron software  inc acquisition in september  which were sold to cyberguard in march see note to the consolidated financial statements 
esecure is commonly referred to herein as secure messaging 
in july  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and the business of pocketscript  llc pocketscript  a privately held development stage enterprise that provided electronic prescription solutions for the healthcare industry 
this acquisition enabled the company to expand its services into ehealth  specifically  the e prescribing marketplace  which is viewed as a promising market as more physicians leverage technology in delivering care 
ehealth consists of an e prescribing solution that allows physicians to use a handheld device to prescribe drugs and transmit the prescription electronically to a pharmacy 
during the prescribing process  the physician is provided with information such as insurance formulary and drug interactions that normally would not be available in a paper prescription format thus allowing the physician to leverage technology for better patient care at the point of delivery 
this expansion was paired with the fact that the number of prescriptions written annually in the united states continues to increase and confidence in the safety of written prescriptions declines 
the company s primary go to market model regarding the pocketscript product  is to sell the service to major national insurance payors  such as blue cross blue shield entities and aetna  who in turn provide it to physicians sponsorship of the service in their coverage area 
economically  the company relies on the annual service fees paid by the insurance payors or the physicians as well as current and future anticipated transaction fees in order to make this business profitable 
ehealth had previously included the dr 
chart hospital based lab results delivery product  previously acquired in the mydoconline acquisition in january  which was sold to mitem in september see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the foundation of the company s business strategy is the development of a subscription business 
the company seeks to build and maintain reliable revenue growth by adding new customers while retaining a high percentage of existing customers 
the subscription model requires large up front investment to establish the service but over time the fixed set up costs are exceeded by the recurring subscription fees 
the nature of the subscription business provides superior returns after the setup costs are overcome as incremental costs to add new users are very low relative to the incremental subscription revenue 
additionally  the company is expecting transaction fees associated with its e prescribing business to augment its annual service fees 
in  the company was successful in reducing its product offerings to focus on two core products where it feels it has a competitive advantage 
these two core products are secure messaging esecure and e prescribing ehealth 
as a secondary but equally important business strategy  the company is balancing the mature and cash producing nature of its mature offering  esecure  with the start up and net cash investing offering of ehealth 
operationally  the success of the company is primarily associated with the following key metrics new subscriptions termed new first year orders for the secure messaging solution renewal rates for the secure messaging service new insurance payor sponsorships of the pocketscript service to physicians successful adoption and usage of the pocketscript service by physicians retention of the users physicians of the pocketscript service future transaction fees or related fees associated with the use of the pocketscript service the ability to increase the business volume with reasonable cost increases 
table of contents known trends regarding these key metrics and their implication on the company s current and future capital requirements are discussed throughout this md a 
operating in emerging markets involves risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts 
successful growth of an early stage enterprise is costly and speculative 
the company s growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of its products and services 
the company has incurred significant operating losses in prior years  the use of cash resources continues at a substantial level and the company anticipates further operating losses in the company will continue to place a strong emphasis on actions to become cash flow breakeven as it balances the need for investments in the e prescribing emerging market with its maturing and contributing secure messaging product 
this emphasis might entail near term cost reductions that may come in the form of workforce reductions  decreased investments in certain areas of the business  geographic consolidation  the incurrence of debt or sale of additional common stock 
strategic actions intended to achieve the goal of cash flow breakeven might have intended or unintended short term adverse effects on certain financial performance metrics for the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
long lived assets the accounting policies and estimates relating to the long lived assets are considered critical because of the significant impact that impairment or obsolescence could have on the company s operating results 
the company s long lived assets subject to amortization and depreciation are comprised of identified intangibles and property and equipment aggregating  or of total assets at december  the property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when certain triggering events occur where there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
the amount of a potential impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the value determined from a projected discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
assumptions are made with respect to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset 
an impairment charge would be recorded for an amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeded the discounted projected net cash flows 
also  even where a current impairment charge is not necessary  the remaining useful lives are evaluated 
during the first quarter of  the company evaluated the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets relating to the mydoconline acquisition and the lives for developed technology and customer relationships were reduced to years from years and years  respectively 
this change in estimate is accounted for prospectively beginning january  should conditions emerge that require these assets to be impaired  the company could recognize a sizable loss 
also during  the company recorded a  impairment charge on fixed assets that were not being utilized and which had no perceived future value 
goodwill  totaling  or of total assets at december   represents the remaining cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in the september acquisition of elron software 
goodwill was  or of total assets at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not being amortized  however  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon the company s market capitalization  which is based on the number of shares of outstanding stock and market price of the stock 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the sale of the message inspector and web inspector products in the first quarter of  which were a significant part of the elron acquisition  caused the company to evaluate the goodwill associated with the sale of net assets 
table of contents representing a portion of the esecure reporting unit 
as a result  the company reduced goodwill in the first quarter of by  as part of the carrying value of the net assets related to that transaction 
this represented of the acquired goodwill from the elron acquisition 
the sale of the dr 
chart product caused the company to evaluate the goodwill associated with the purchase of mydoconline  of which dr 
chart was a significant portion 
as a result  the company included in the carrying amount of assets sold in the dr 
chart sale  the entire goodwill balance of  associated with the acquisition of mydoconline 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions 
future changes made to the current estimates or assumptions  including such factors as order volumes and price levels  life spans of purchased technology  continuity of acquired customers  alternative uses for property and equipment and levels of operating expenses  could result in an unanticipated impairment charge from the write down of the company s long lived assets or goodwill 
deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the subject net operating loss carry forwards and unused tax credits will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   the company continued to provide a full valuation allowance against accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting the company s historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
if the company begins to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which its estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as promulgated by sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  emerging issues task force eitf abstract no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and other related pronouncements 
accounting for revenue is complex due to the long term and often multiple element nature of zixcorp s contracts with customers and the potential for incorrect application of accounting guidance requires that revenue recognition be considered a critical accounting policy 
the company develops  markets  licenses and supports computer software products and services 
the company s products can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits  esecure subscription based services  the pocketscript e prescribing service  various transaction fees and professional services 
a majority of the revenues currently generated by the company are through direct sales  however  the company employs a network of distributors and resellers 
under all product categories and distribution models  the company recognizes revenue after all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for sales from the company s network of distributors and resellers  delivery occurs when the distributor sells the product to the end user 
in the event the arrangement has multiple elements with delivered and undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered elements are recognized under the residual method only when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists to allocate the fair value of the total fees to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
occasionally  when zixcorp is engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation no revenue will be recognized until the customer accepts the product 
discounts provided to the customer are recorded as reductions in revenue 
subscription based services include the secure messaging services of zixmail  zixvpm  zixport  and zixauditor  as well as certain products acquired from mydoconline which were sold on september   see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these services may include a combination of an appliance  software  secure electronic communications  and customer support throughout the subscription period 
in all zixcorp s subscription services  the customer does not own a perpetual right to a software license  but is instead granted the use of that license during the period of the service subscription 
subscriptions are generally multiple year contracts that are irrevocable and non refundable in nature and require annual payments 
the subscription period begins on the date specified by the parties when the service is fully functional for the customer which is consequently deemed to be the date of acceptance 
revenues from subscription services are recorded as service revenue as the services are rendered from the date of acceptance over the subscription period 
subscription fees received from customers in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenues ratably over the subscription period 

table of contents from september  and extending through the first quarter  the company sold anti spam filtering  email content filtering  and web filtering solutions to customers under perpetual licensing arrangements 
these perpetual software licenses were normally sold as part of multiple element arrangements that included annual maintenance and or subscription  and may have included implementation or training services 
acceptance for these products was generally when delivered if they were self installable by the customer and upon installation if installation was required to be done by zixcorp professional services 
these products were primarily self installed 
where vsoe had not been established for undelivered elements  revenue for all elements was deferred until those elements were delivered or their fair values determined 
however  if vsoe was determinable for all of the undelivered elements  and the undelivered elements were not essential to the delivered elements  the company deferred recognition of the fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognized as revenue the remaining portion of the arrangement through application of the residual method 
evidence of vsoe for implementation and training services associated with the anti spam  email content filtering and web filtering arrangements was based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for the individuals expected to perform the related services 
installation and training revenues were recognized as the services were rendered 
the company established vsoe for maintenance based upon the fact that maintenance was sold separately 
maintenance revenue was recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally one year 
on march   the web inspector and message inspector product lines  which perform anti spam  e mail content filtering  and web filtering  were sold to cyberguard and all related revenue ceased for zixcorp 
these product lines were acquired in september when the company purchased elron software  inc revenues for the web inspector and message inspector product lines were   and  in  and  respectively 
the sale of message inspector and web inspector is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on september   the company sold the remaining mydoconline product dr 
chart to mitem and all related revenue ceased for zixcorp 
this product was acquired in january  when the company purchased mydoconline 
revenues for the dr 
chart product line were  and  for and respectively 
the sale of dr 
chart is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has been recognizing revenue on the pocketscript e prescribing service as a multiple element arrangement with separate units of accounting 
vsoe is determined for the undelivered elements  and the residual value is assigned to the hardware device and is recognized upon installation of the device at an end user location 
installation is determined by physical delivery of a functioning product 
the fair values of the undelivered elements relate to ongoing services and are recognized ratably over the period of the service 
the company establishes vsoe for the service elements based upon contract renewal rates or fair market values if the element is commonly sold by others 
where the company determines that vsoe cannot be established  the company recognizes revenue for all elements in the arrangement ratably over the contractual service period 
in the third quarter of  the e prescribing contract terms for new customers were changed to a more bundled arrangement which required that all revenue related elements of the contract are accounted for together as subscription fees  thus  this revenue is being amortized over the contract life and reported as service revenues 
some of the company s services incorporate a transaction fee per event occurrence or when predetermined usage levels have been reached 
these fees are recognized as revenue when the transaction occurs or when the predetermined usage levels have been achieved 
the company does not offer stand alone services 
further  the company s services include various warranty provisions  however  warranty expense was not material to any period presented 
deferred cost of revenue in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy  the revenue associated with certain pocketscript deployments is being recognized ratably over the period the services are being delivered 
to properly match direct costs and revenue  the company defers the direct  incremental costs of each deployment expected to be recovered 
these costs consist mainly of the cost of the handheld device  and are recorded as deferred cost of revenue 
the deferred costs are then amortized into cost of revenue ratably over the period which revenue is recognized 
the deferred cost of revenue of  is included in other assets as of december  there was no deferred cost of revenue balance at december

private placement of common stock and warrants see note to the consolidated financial statements on august   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement the purchase agreement with certain purchasers collectively  the purchasers to issue and sell an aggregate of  units consisting of i one share of common stock of the company  par value per share the common stock  and ii a related warrant to purchase one third of one share of common stock 
total proceeds from the private placement were  before transaction costs of  redemption of convertible notes see note to the consolidated financial statements in april  the company entered into amendments with the holders of the company s  convertible promissory notes to restructure the original purchase agreements signed on november  the restructuring resulted in the company recording an additional discount of  relating to a beneficial conversion feature in the amended notes 
this amount was fully amortized into interest expense during the company made all payments and redemptions required by the restructured convertible promissory notes throughout the required payments and redemptions included  of principal  redeemed in stock   paid in cash   of early payment premium  redeemed in stock   paid in cash  and  of interest  redeemed in stock   paid in cash

table of contents on december   the company transacted an early extinguishment of of the remaining outstanding balance of the convertible promissory notes  utilizing restricted cash 
as part of the partial debt extinguishment the company paid a early payment premium and all accrued interest 
the company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of results of operations revenues the company s revenues have grown substantially from through from growth of the secure e messaging market  primarily driven by hipaa requirements in the healthcare industry  and from the and early acquisitions of new technologies 
the company recognized revenues from the products associated with these technologies immediately after their acquisition and continued to do so until their divestiture 
because of the increases in revenues stemming from the acquisition of pocketscript and the mi wi products in and dr 
chart in early  and then the offsetting affects of the divestiture of the mi wi products and dr 
chart in  the company s revenues between and decreased slightly or were relatively flat 
however  the year over year increase in revenues for secure messaging and pocketscript  the company s remaining product lines  was 
looking ahead  the company s revenue growth is expected to come from continued growth in the secure e messaging market  including the healthcare industry  recent expansion into new vertical markets and broader distribution channels  and for the e prescribing market  through broader market adoption of the e prescribing technology 
as to e prescribing revenues  the company expects that more arrangements will result in revenue being amortized over the contract life and reported as service revenues versus the previous arrangements that resulted in the hardware element being recognized as hardware revenues upon deployment 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the key components of the company s revenues variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
services hardware  na software total revenues secure messaging is primarily a subscription based service  the mi wi products were primarily sold as perpetual licenses with annual maintenance and or subscription contracts  prior to the third quarter  the pocketscript e prescribing service was sold as a subscription service with a larger first year fee relative to future years to accommodate the installation and distribution of a device  and the mydoconline product and services fell into either a subscription based arrangement or a perpetual license sale 
all or part of these products might incorporate a transaction fee element where a per event occurrence can generate service revenue 
additionally  the company offers certain professional services in conjunction with its products 
with the exception of perpetual software licenses mi wi products and occasionally the dr 
chart product and an early stage e prescribing contract  the company generally recognizes revenue over the life of a related service contract 
the shift towards mostly subscription based offerings in late led to the decline in hardware and software revenue streams 
in the fourth quarter  there were no recorded hardware and software revenues 
the subscription period begins upon deployment and customer acceptance of the ordered services 
sales returns and allowances occur infrequently and were not material in any period 
further  revenues result primarily from direct sales efforts  although the company employed a network of distributors and resellers for the recently sold mi wi products and increasingly is adding resellers for the secure messaging services

table of contents the  increase in secure messaging when comparing the years ended december  and is attributed to an increase in new subscribers to the secure messaging service while maintaining a high rate of customer renewals 
the recurring nature of the subscription model makes revenue rise in a predictable manner assuming adequate subscription renewal rates and continued new additions to the subscription base 
adding to the predictability is the company s go to market model of selling primarily three year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of the year of service 
in the second half of  the company substantially increased the list price for the secure messaging products 
throughout the company has maintained that price increase and has experienced relatively consistent discount percentages off the list price over the last few years 
when comparing years ended december  and  the  increase resulted from new corporate customers primarily in the healthcare sector and service renewals by existing customers 
the revenues from pocketscript increased by  when comparing the year ended december  and under certain pocketscript contracts that were signed before  the hardware component of the arrangement was immediately recognized as hardware revenue on installation and a portion of the fee is being recognized as service revenue ratably over the service period under the residual method 
overall deployments under all pocketscript contracts were relatively flat in compared to and in a subscription service model  this should lead to linear revenue growth 
however  this growth was not realized  as installations in the first half of were primarily under pre contracts resulting in some immediate revenue recognition  while deployments in the second half of have almost all been under the new subscription contracts which resulted in all revenue being recognized over the contract service period 
this resulted in a decline in pocketscript revenue in the third quarter ended september  relative to the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter ended december  was flat when compared with the preceding quarter 
this trend resulting from the change in the contract mix could continue in the short term  but should be offset and surpassed over time with the more linear revenue recognition treatment under the new contracts assuming continued new deployments and adequate renewal rates 
the market for the e prescribing products is still in early stage development and not enough time has elapsed to examine the impact of price fluctuations 
when comparing years ended december  and  the  increase consisted of  in hardware sales for the handheld devices and  for related subscription services to physicians in under two insurance payor sponsorship agreements

backlog  orders  and deployments the company s end user order backlog is comprised of contractually bound agreements that the company expects to fully amortize into revenue 
as of december   the backlog was approximately  and is comprised of the following elements  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid   billed but unpaid and approximately  of unbilled contracts 
the backlog can be further divided by product  of which  is for secure messaging and  for pocketscript 
excluded from the backlog at december  is a customer deposit from aventis of  the deposit is excluded from backlog because the company currently does not expect that aventis will request that any service be performed under the contract and that revenue will not be recognized 
the company believes that the expected lack of performance stems from the aventis acquisition by sanofi 
sanofi aventis has communicated to the company that after the acquisition aventis is undertaking a new direction and that the services will likely not be needed 
further discussion can be found at note to the consolidated financial statements 
the backlog is recognized into revenue as the services are performed 
approximately of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue in the timing of revenue is affected by both the length of time required to deploy a service and the length of the service contract 
the company s future revenue growth beyond what is scheduled to be recognized from the backlog is determined by additional new first year orders and total orders for secure messaging coupled with renewal rates for existing customers whose contracts are expiring 
for pocketscript the future revenue will be determined by securing additional payor sponsorships  increasing adoption and utilization by the physicians  renewing existing deployments as they expire  and developing additional transactions based fees 
the order input for secure messaging in was  compared with  in the new subscriber momentum is better measured in terms of the dollar amount of new first year orders for the service 
the new first year orders were  in and  in new first year orders is a subset of the total orders and a more accurate determinant of new subscription growth 
total orders include new first year orders and also includes renewals and additional years of the service contracted upfront 
the renewal rate for secure e messaging customers was in excess of for  which is consistent with renewal rates 
the company continues to experience a high percentage of customers who choose to subscribe for the secure messaging service for a three year term versus a one year term 
the company expects this preference for a longer contract term to continue in  as the company has priced its services in a manner that encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
while the company experienced a substantial price increase for its secure messaging service in relative to  there are no assurances that the increasing competition in this market will not result in price erosion in and beyond 
such a price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on the company s future revenues 
the pocketscript product and corresponding e prescribing market is significantly earlier in its development phase when compared to secure messaging and as such multi year trends are not available 
the company secured sponsorships for  new subscribers in which was relatively flat when compared with the largest base of deployed units is in massachusetts and were sponsored by the erx collaborative a joint effort of three of the largest insurance payors in massachusetts 
while the sponsorship contracts identify the individual physicians using the device as responsible for renewing the service after the first year  the collaborative elected to renew all the deployments through calendar year and have subsequently agreed to fund physicians actively using the 
table of contents service as they come up for renewal in the company currently has transaction based contracts related to fees for sending prescriptions electronically to the pharmacies and for certain transactions involving prescriptions related to two pharmacy benefits managers pbm and a usage based arrangement measured by improvements in prescribing behavior with one of the payor sponsors 
while deploying more users will increase the prescriptions written and thus increase the potential for transaction fees under current agreements  substantial revenue increases from transaction fees will require new fee based contracts 
the company is seeking such agreements with other interested parties 
there are numerous current and potential transaction type services that could be offered to these parties  including hosting of additional formularies  secure messaging on the devices and data reporting as examples 
however  there are no assurances that these additional revenue sources can be secured in order to increase or maintain the revenue from each prescription written 
the number of prescriptions written using the service and thus transmitted through the company s data center has been growing rapidly 
at the end of  the monthly level was approximately  prescriptions and at the end of  the monthly amount was approximately  prescriptions 
the company is investing greater sales effort and post deployment attention to maximizing utilization in order to maximize future revenue potential both through renewals and transaction fees 
the company believes that the sponsorship model is currently the prevalent market demand model 
while the company has additional deployments to conduct under existing sponsorship agreements  continued growth in this area will require additional payor sponsors or a change in the market demand model 
customer deposit a master services agreement was entered into with aventis for  on january   the same date as the mydoconline acquisition  for the company s performance of various future services 
the services were to be delivered in minimum amounts of   and  prior to january   january   and january   respectively 
the services were to be defined on an ongoing basis over the life of the agreement and valued in accordance with pricing for similar services rendered by the company to other customers 
aventis paid the  upon execution of the master services agreement 
since the company s services to be provided to aventis were not yet fully defined  the  payment was recorded as a customer deposit 
as the services are defined and priced in individual project agreements  the value of the defined element will be reclassified to deferred revenues and then recognized as revenue in accordance with applicable revenue recognition criteria 
if the services are not requested by aventis by the dates outlined above  the deposit will be forfeited and zixcorp will recognize the deposit as a customer deposit forfeiture 
the company is required to return to aventis any unused portion of the deposit only in the event of material breach of the contract by the company  in the event the company or a party employed or engaged by the company is debarred pursuant to the generic drug enforcement act of or similar state  local  or foreign law  in the event the company files for bankruptcy  or in the event of force majeure 
the company believes that it is unlikely any of these events will occur 
the company s obligations associated with the master services agreement are secured by a first priority lien on the company s property and equipment and accounts receivable 
as of december   the company has provided  of services to sanofi aventis under this master services agreement which was recognized as revenue in subsequent to the mydoconline acquisition  aventis merged with sanofi and the rights under this agreement were transferred to the new company  sanofi aventis 
the company and sanofi aventis agreed to extend the january   deadline for utilizing the  remaining balance of the initial  to april  the  was not utilized by sanofi aventis by april   and the company advised sanofi aventis that the unused  was forfeited to the company 
this amount is recognized as a customer deposit forfeiture in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the  to be used by january   has also been forfeited as sanofi aventis did not request any services 
cost of revenues a significant portion of the company s cost of revenues relates to the cost of operating and maintaining the zixdata center  which is currently not fully utilized 
accordingly  costs associated with the data center  which are relatively fixed in nature  are expected to grow at a much slower pace than revenue 
cost of revenues also includes the activities of field deployment  professional services and customer service and support  which are relatively variable in nature 
further  the company s two product lines  esecure and ehealth  have both product specific costs that are readily identifiable  and extensive shared costs of revenues 
management estimates and makes assumptions regarding these shared costs to calculate an estimated cost of revenues per product line 
it is estimated that the  of total cost of revenues for is comprised of  for esecure and  for ehealth 
this compares to total cost of revenue of  which is estimated to be comprised of  for esecure and  for ehealth 

table of contents for further comparative purposes  the revenue in for esecure was  and  for ehealth  while in revenue for esecure was  with  revenue recognized for ehealth 
the results of these estimates show that esecure has revenue in excess of the estimated costs of revenue while the reverse is true of ehealth 
secure messaging has shown the ability to grow revenues and only marginally increase the costs of revenues as more efficient methods of product delivery and service have been implemented 
while this trend is expected to continue  it is not expected to continue to the extent it has in the past 
eventually  additional efficiencies become more difficult to achieve and the costs of revenues could rise at a rate consistent with the increases in revenue 
the trend in pocketscript costs of revenues have risen significantly in the last year as the company builds the required base of resources to provide and service these products 
pocketscript cost of revenues has a sizable fixed component but also has a variable component associated with the cost of devices  physician recruiting  installation and training 
additional increases in pocketscript revenue  should demand occur  is expected to result in a corresponding increase in the related costs of revenues 
the extent that the cost of revenue for the ehealth product line is variable with revenue is dependant on the structure of future pocketscript arrangements  and is not yet known

the cost of revenues decline of  from to was the result of an estimated  savings from divested or discontinued products see note to the consolidated financial statements offset by an estimated  increase in cost of revenues for the non divested products  primarily pocketscript 
cost of revenues decreased  between and primarily due to reductions in non personnel costs totaling  and reductions in personnel costs totaling  the significant activities supporting the decreases in non personnel costs consists of  for software content filtering fees  royalties and related user licenses and  for amortization costs for intangible assets  all resulting from the sale of the mi wi and dr 
chart product lines and the discontinuance of the connect service   for pocketscript related costs of hand held devices  the latter of which is due to a combination of decreased volume of deployments between periods and a change in the contracts whereby incremental deployment costs are capitalized allowing the costs to be recognized over the service period to appropriately match related revenues  a  reduction in occupancy costs and  for outside consultants 
the decrease in personnel costs was due to the above mentioned divestures and or discontinuance of the stated product lines  partially offset by increases to expand and maintain the company s deployment and client services capabilities to support the order growth of the company s pocketscript products and services 
cost of revenues rose substantially in compared to the  increase in cost of revenues between and was primarily due to incremental operating costs resulting from the acquisitions of pocketscript  inc  in july  elron software  inc  in september and mydoconline in january  and increased headcount in to expand the company s deployment and client services capabilities to support the forecasted order growth of ehealth  primarily the deployment of pocketscript handheld devices 
personnel costs accounted for approximately  of the increase 
non personnel costs accounted for the remainder of the increase and consisted of significant cost elements including  for direct costs associated with the deployment of pocketscript handheld devices   for the amortization of intangible assets   for third party health information content license fees and royalties   for occupancy costs   for off site data center support costs associated with the mydoconline acquisition that were subsequently eliminated in with the migration of those support services into the company s data center   for travel related expenses and  for outside consulting services primarily associated with the three acquired businesses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased in versus a increase between and the decreases were the result of higher spending in related to newly acquired products from business acquisitions 
since the acquisitions  these costs have been significantly reduced by merging various initiatives into the core research and development spending and thus 
table of contents decreasing the overall costs of research and development

the increases were partially offset by a  decrease in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment resulting from certain equipment becoming fully depreciated 
we expect research and development costs in to be comparable to the reported expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administration expenses decreased in when compared to the general trend is a reduction in expenses as the company consolidates various marketing initiatives from acquired companies into a centrally managed initiative and as the company focuses on its two core markets 
these reductions have been partially offset by increases in marketing and sales costs for the pocketscript products and increases in the costs of being a publicly held company 
while the publicly traded company costs increased in in order to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements  they did not abate significantly in and are not expected to do so in as continued compliance remains expensive

selling  general and administration expense was reduced in the second half of verses the first half of the year by focusing on cost control 
finally  while the company experienced increased costs in some areas  namely costs associated with new sarbanes oxley compliance requirements  reductions were made that offset and exceeded the increased corporate governance costs 
customer deposit forfeiture the  reduction of operating expenses recorded in represents the forfeiture by sanofi aventis of a customer deposit in accordance with a master services agreement  which was entered into with aventis for  on the same date as the mydoconline acquisition see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the company s performance of various future services 
the services were to be delivered in minimum amounts of   and  prior to january   january   and january   respectively

the  to be used by january   has also been forfeited as sanofi aventis did not request any services 
the company believes that the forfeitures of the deposit is most likely associated with a change in strategic direction that came about as a result of the merger between sanofi and aventis and the resulting change in personnel 
this amount will be recognized as a customer deposit forfeiture in the first quarter of the future status on the remaining deposit is unknown at this time 
gain loss on sale of product lines on march   the company sold its web inspector and message inspector product lines to cyberguard corporation

asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a  impairment charge on fixed assets that were not being utilized and which had no perceived future value 
these assets were not disposed of and could be utilized by the company in the future  however  the company concluded that the fixed assets should be recorded at the estimated market value 
during the third quarter of  the company determined that it would focus on the company s two core markets and reduce costs relating to the company s services in non core markets 
accordingly  company management determined that it would suspend research and development investment for the mydoconline connect service  cease sales and marketing efforts to obtain new 
table of contents customers for the connect service and  where reasonably feasible and appropriate  migrate existing connect customers to other vendors 
the company s decision significantly and adversely changed the extent and use of the connect service  for which the company has recorded an identifiable intangible asset 
the resulting test for recoverability resulted in an impairment to the intangible asset of approximately  interest expense interest expense for and was  and  respectively  and consisted of the following stated financing total interest discount premium cost warrants interest on notes amortization accretion amortization issued expense convertible promissory notes payable promissory note payable short term promissory notes capital leases total interest expense convertible promissory notes payable promissory note payable short term promissory notes capital leases total interest expense as more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  the convertible promissory notes payable have a stated interest rate that is reset every six months to the six month libor rate plus basis points 
this rate was reset on november   to 
a portion of the face value of the notes was allocated to discount on notes payable to account for the valuation of warrants issued with the notes and an embedded beneficial conversion feature 
this discount is being amortized into interest expense and totaled  for the  of premium accretion is a penalty on the early payment of  of convertible notes payable 
in addition  the company issued  warrants with an exercise price of to one convertible note holder whose convertible note was partially paid in cash 
these warrants were valued at  using the black scholes option pricing model bsopm and the following assumptions contractual life of three years  risk free interest rate of  volatility of and no dividends payable during the contractual term 
the company incurred  of financing costs relating to the issuance of the  of convertible promissory notes payable in november these costs were deferred and are being amortized into interest expense over the term of the notes

zixcorp issued a promissory note in connection with the acquisition of mydoconline in january see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this note bears interest at an annual rate of and is payable only in services provided by the company to sanofi aventis unless there is an event of default 
as of december   sanofi aventis has requested no services in lieu of interest and the company believes that it is not probable that sanofi aventis will request such services 
in addition  the potential costs of delivering any unspecified services cannot be estimated 
therefore  no interest expense or liabilities have been recorded in relation to the stated interest rate on the note 
investment and other income investment and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in over is attributable to higher interest rates and the overall higher cash balances due to the private placement of common stock which resulted in  of net proceeds to the company in the second half of additional interest was earned on the total  of notes receivable that resulted from the sale of web inspector and message

by comparison  the interest expense in was  and in it was  discontinued operations prior to  the company provided systems and solutions for the intelligent transportation  electronic security  and other markets 
the company s operations included the design  manufacturing  installation  and support of hardware and software products utilizing the company s wireless data and security technologies 
the businesses comprising these products  the transportation systems group  cotag international and cardkey systems  were sold during in three separate transactions 
these businesses were presented as discontinued operations 

table of contents the gain on sale of discontinued operations of  in primarily represents the reduction of estimated future costs for various indemnification issues associated with the disposal of these businesses 
there were no income taxes recorded on these gains 
there were no gains on sale or accrued costs relating to discontinued operations for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources overview due to the company s history of operating spending in excess of customer receipts  liquidity is of special importance 
essential to liquidity is the ability of the company to meet its obligations as they become due without substantial disposition of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
long term  it is imperative that the company become cash flow positive from operations 
as the company is operating in developing and emerging markets for its products  it cannot predict with certainty the projected time scale for such operational cash flow breakeven 
in late and early  the company embarked on a strategy to focus on two areas it deemed as core to the company  these were secure messaging esecure and e prescribing ehealth 
these two areas are believed by the company to be the most promising of its line of business 
other areas were viewed as less appealing long term and  therefore  using valuable financial and management resources that were better focused on the two core product areas 
during  the plan put in place to bring the company to a focus on the core products was completed 
this was accomplished by shutting down the connect product  selling the message and web inspector products  selling the dr 
chart product and eliminating other non essential positions in the company 
also in  the company sought to significantly reduce its debt 
in particular  the goal was to reduce the debt to a level where the debt level could not materially affect the company s ability to conduct operations 
through debt repayments in cash both from restricted and non restricted accounts and the company s common stock  the debt was reduced from  at the beginning of the year to  at the end of the year  excluding discounts and capital leases 
the company has total contractual obligations over the next year of  and  over the next three years consisting of leases and debt obligations inclusive of the  in outstanding debt 
these amounts include  in convertible debt payments  due in both november and but callable at the noteholders option after april  and therefore assumed to be a twelve month contractual commitment for convertible notes  which will be paid from the  cash held in a restricted collateral account 
the three year total also includes the  note due january to aventis which is payable in cash or common stock at the company s discretion 
therefore  with these items removed  the contractual cash requirements needed for payment of lease and debt obligations that are expected to be funded from unrestricted cash by the company in the next months is  and  over the next three years 
cash usage in excess of these commitments represents operating spending that the company chooses to make in order to satisfy existing customer contracts and to secure new orders and cover various overhead costs 
the company believes much of the spending in excess of contractual commitments is discretionary and flexible 
the company is engaged in two primary markets email encryption and e prescribing esecure and ehealth 
both are subscription businesses that share a common business model 
first  the service is established which requires a start up cost and recurring fixed costs to provide the service 
secondly  subscribers are acquired and brought onto the service which requires a variable acquisition cost of selling and marketing  installation or deployment 
the third stage is to continue recruiting subscribers until a critical mass of them are reached in order for the fixed recurring service costs to be overcome 
the company generally charges a first year fee for the service that covers the incremental acquisition costs  however  year two and beyond of the service for each subscriber results in a much greater return to the company  as the annual fees are paid but the incremental costs are very minimal 
therefore  both the rate at which new subscribers are added and the ability to retain subscribers are critical metrics 
operationally  the future cash flow improvement of the company is primarily associated with the following key metrics related to esecure and ehealth new subscriptions termed new first year orders for the secure messaging solution renewal rates for the secure messaging service new insurance payor sponsorships of the pocketscript service to physicians successful adoption and usage of the pocketscript service by physicians 
table of contents retention of the users physicians of the pocketscript service future transaction fees or related fees associated with the use of the pocketscript service the ability to increase the business volume with reasonable cost increases for several years the spending in esecure far exceeded cash receipts 
as that business has matured  the gap between cash spending and cash used for operations has narrowed substantially and the company believes it will continue to do so 
this was accomplished by increasing year on year new first year orders approximately  in and  in as well as maintaining a high customer renewal rate approximately for and of existing customers whose initial contracted service period had expired 
the recurring nature of the subscription model makes cash receipts naturally rise in a predictable manner assuming adequate subscription renewal and continued new additions to the subscription base 
adding to the predictability is the company s model of selling primarily three year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
the company was successful in and in adding new subscribers at a growing rate and maintaining a high rate of customer renewals without substantial increases in costs 
the company expects the esecure business to generate cash receipts in excess of its specific operating costs in and beyond assuming continued addition of new subscribers and maintaining consistent subscriber renewal rates 
the e prescribing product and corresponding market is significantly earlier in its development phase when compared to secure messaging and thus the company has chosen to spend money in excess of the cash receipts to build that e prescribing subscription base in the hopes of reaching a critical mass of subscribers to overcome the spending needed to provide the service 
the ehealth business has a variable spending element to obtain and set up new subscribers and a fixed cost of providing the service offering itself 
the company is able to reduce variable spending from levels should subscription volume weaken in this product line and alternatively  should subscriptions increase  the variable spending would increase  but the company would expect to offset such an increase with additional cash receipts 
a certain level of subscribers is required for the company to generate returns on a per subscriber basis to overcome the fixed costs of providing the e prescribing service 
the company believes that between  and  active users of the e prescribing product are needed for these fixed costs to be overcome  the breakeven point being strongly influenced by success in negotiating additional and maintaining existing transaction based fee structures 
as of december   the company had approximately  such active prescribers on the service 
the company has a two fold objective in deploying new users first  to ensure they become active users of the service and then to ensure that the users choose to renew their service retention 
for deployments that occurred in and early  the percentage of deployed users who became regular active users was approximately 
the company changed its contracts  recruiting and training strategy to increase the regular user rate in the second half of  and is targeting further improvements in and beyond 
the largest deployment of active users that has come up for renewal is from a single initiative funded by one large payor  which has elected to pay and renew the service for active users 
while this is a positive development  not enough historical data exists across the customer base to determine a trend in retention rates for e prescribing 
the transaction based fees or usage fees form an important part of  to  breakeven active user projection 
with fewer transaction fees  the company believes the  level is needed and with more transaction fees  the company believes the  level will suffice for covering fixed costs of the e prescribing service 
the company currently has contracts that allow the company to bill fees for sending and receiving prescriptions electronically to the pharmacies and for certain transactions involving prescriptions related to two pharmacy benefits managers pbm and a usage based arrangement measured by improvements in prescribing behavior with one of the payor sponsors 
the fees being realized by the company under these contracts are not sufficient to cover the fixed costs of the e prescribing service 
securing further transaction based revenue streams will be required so that the  to  physician level will provide returns in excess of the fixed costs to provide the e prescribing service 
the company has resources tasked with securing additional transaction based revenue sources 
the success of this effort will depend on market acceptance for the services offered as well as having sufficient physicians deployed that make the transaction services appealing to buyers 
the company believes the current and potential transaction type services are numerous with hosting of additional insurer drug formularies  secure messaging on the devices and data reporting as examples 
the company continues to closely monitor developments in the ehealth product and e prescribing market and will adjust spending in that area commensurate with expected future returns and  if needed  augment the investment needed with additional capital or strategic relationships 
the extent and timing of the company s success or lack thereof in the e prescribing market will ultimately be the most significant operational determinant of liquidity and capital needs in the extent to which the company views the e prescribing market as attractive for investment will determine the company s willingness to fund additional operational cash losses if required 
the company has the ability to adjust cash spending to react to any shortfalls in projected cash collections or to adjust spending in certain investment areas should cash receipts make that possible or  if warranted and if the terms are acceptable  with 
table of contents additional external financing  receipts from exercised stock options and warrants of the company s common stock or strategic partnerships 
as a result of strategic actions taken in  relatively low contractual spending commitments in  historically high customer renewals and continued growth in the secure messaging product  cost containment ability in the emerging area of e prescribing and general flexibility in discretionary spending  the company believes it has adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations for calendar year and is targeting cash flow improvements to augment its liquidity beyond this time frame 
however  operating in emerging and developing markets involves risk and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the company will ultimately achieve or achieve in a sufficiently timely manner its targeted improvements 
if necessary and if the expected returns warrant it  the company could further augment its cash flow position through additional cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings or a combination of these actions 
operationally  the extent and timing of success and potential returns in the ehealth market will ultimately be the most significant operational determinant of liquidity 
the extent to which the company views the ehealth market as attractive for investment will determine the company s willingness to fund additional operational cash losses

the company anticipates that growth should continue as long as new subscriptions and the rate of customer renewals are sustained with minimal cost increases 
the company believes that secure messaging cash flow will improve in traditionally  the second quarter  which contains the company s four largest annual renewals is the yearly highpoint in cash receipts  while the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been lower compared to the second quarter 
the divested products should have no further impact on operating cash flow  and company overhead is again expected to remain relatively flat 
the early stage and quickly changing market of pocketscript makes the expected cash usage for the company s e prescribing service in less certain 
improved cash utilization for the e prescribing product is dependant upon securing new payor sponsorships  experiencing adequate renewal rates of existing users and increasing the sources of cash from transaction based fees 
the company continues to

as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash flows provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  cash used for the corresponding period in included in these amounts was  of cash proceeds from sales of marketable securities in and net purchases of marketable securities of  in these marketable securities were auction rate securities and therefore  not classified as cash regardless of their liquid nature 
further  there was a decline year on year in the purchases of property  plant and equipment of  a net change of  regarding restricted cash balances whereby the company placed  into restricted accounts in and had net cash released from restricted accounts of  in and net cash from the sale of product lines in of  net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided of  for the corresponding period in the  decrease in financing cash flows was primarily attributable to a decrease of  from a decline of stock option and warrant exercises by employees and outside holders in compared to in addition  in the company received  in exchange for a promissory note from aventis  inc  involving the acquisition of mydoconline and net proceeds from the issuance of convertible debentures to omicron master trust and amulet limited of  in  the company used cash from financing activities of  to pay down the various debt instruments  primarily the convertible notes  and certain capital leases and received net proceeds of  from a private placement of its common stock 
cash sources essential to the company s operating cash sources is the contractual backlog that has not yet been billed  esecure customer renewals as their current contracts are expiring  newly acquired subscription customers for secure messaging  renewing e prescribing customers from previous deployments  new e prescribing contracts  and transaction fees under e prescribing contracts 
backlog the company s end user order backlog of  is comprised of contractually bound agreements that are expected to be amortized into revenue as services are provided in the future 
the majority of these contracts are time based subscription contracts with billings in advance of annual service periods 
most customers elect to commit to multiple years of service and are invoiced annually 
the backlog is comprised of  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid and  that has not yet been collected in cash as of december  the company estimates  will be billed in continued growth of secure e messaging business the company estimates cash receipts from secure messaging in will be between  to  at the low end of this range  the company assumes it will collect contractually billed amounts  experience continued customer renewal rates of  and continue adding new first year orders at the same rate demonstrated over the last months 
should new first year customer orders increase year on year as they did from to  the high end of the range could be reached 
this would represent a  to  increase in gross cash receipts compared to for comparative purposes  cash receipts increased  when compared to furthermore  should the company achieve significant success in its new oem distribution strategy in addition to continual new first year order growth from traditional channels  the cash receipts estimate of  to  could be exceeded 
the company estimates that  of the estimated cash receipts is from second  third and in some cases the fourth year of the subscribers service period 
these out year collections provide a significantly greater incremental cash contribution to the business relative to the first year of service as the incremental costs to acquire the subscriber are not present in the out years 
new e prescribing payors the company s go to market model in e prescribing has been to contract with healthcare payors who pay us to provide the service to physicians for at least one year 
the company believes that this model is the most cost effective method of addressing the market in large quantities at this time 
the company has demonstrated selling and deployment success with this model with the erx collaborative initiative in massachusetts  as well as two new pilot programs in with aetna and independence blue cross 
the company s current list price for the first year of the service is  and a year in subsequent years 
the greatest concentration of active deployed e prescribing units is with the erx collaborative initiative 
while the contract calls for physicians to pay the annual service fee  the erx collaborative has agreed to renew active users of the product under their sponsorship initiative and they are expected to continue to do so through the company currently has a usage based arrangement with one of the payor sponsors  which provides for the payment of fees to the company based on achievement of measured improvements in prescribing behavior 
because of the relatively low margins on installation and the initial year of service  the ability to secure renewals and additional transaction based sources of cash is an important aspect of the company s cash flow breakeven plan for e prescribing 

table of contents e prescribing usage based fees the company s go to market model in e prescribing also involves securing additional fee based contracts where customers pay for various transactions that occur through the e prescribing service 
for example  the company has contracts with pharmacy benefit managers for prescriptions that are fulfilled through their system 
currently  the company has contracts that can provide between and cents per prescription written in the service 
as the number of prescriptions increases  the expected cash receipts increases 
securing further transaction based revenue streams will be required so that the previously discussed  to  active physician level will provide returns in excess of fixed costs of providing the e prescribing service 
cash requirements while the contractual commitments of the company as of december   are relatively low in comparison to historical cash used from operations and a substantial portion of the contractual obligations  is held in collateral restricted cash accounts  the company anticipates further net cash usage from operations in the company s cash requirements consist principally of the company s contractual commitments  funding its operating losses as it pursues a leadership position in the emerging markets in which it operates  and capital expenditures  primarily for computer equipment to support new customer orders and  over time  on going refurbishment of the data center and customer located computer equipment 
the company believes that its secure messaging service will be a net provider of operating cash in versus a net user of cash in assuming continued new subscriptions  renewal rates at historical levels and the company s continued ability to add new subscribers to the system with minimal incremental costs 
the company s cash requirements beyond contractual commitments are primarily aimed at continued investment in the pocketscript business  which the company chooses to continue in its endeavor to reach a subscription base in this business that provides net cash inflows 
the company has variable acquisition costs associated with adding subscribers to both the secure e messaging and e prescribing services 
for secure messaging  the costs are primarily selling and marketing  while for pocketscript the costs are primarily recruitment and deployment related  including a hardware device 
in the first year of the service  the company generally collects fees from the subscriber that covers these variable acquisition costs 
after the first year of service the incremental cost to support customers decreases significantly  which increases the variable cash contribution to the company as each contract matures 
in addition  cash contributions from transaction based fees are high as the incremental costs to support these fees are minor 
in the fourth quarter of the company had deployments of the e prescribing solution in the unit range 
future quarter deployments greater than these quantities will equate to greater variable costs offset with greater cash receipts from the sponsors and lower deployments versus this current run rate would equate to lower variable costs than recently experienced 
based on the company s organization and current order rates as of december   the annualized operating spending for is currently projected to be between  and  this is a decline from the  spending level 
the decline represents a drop in spending on divested products of  along with additional year on year reductions in some discretionary spending areas offset by expected increases in variable costs for incremental e prescribing deployments 
debt instruments and related covenants as more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december  the company has debt obligations relating to three separate arrangements convertible promissory notes payable  promissory note payable  short term promissory notes  convertible promissory notes payable on april   the company entered into amendments with the investors to restructure the original  purchase agreements signed on november  as of december   the company had repaid  of the  convertible notes payable with  of cash and  of common stock 
the remaining  is payable in two equal installments of  in november and and the terms remain unchanged from the original notes signed november  the company intends to pay these from restricted cash balances should these tranches not convert to shares of common stock before their due dates 

table of contents under the covenants of the amended notes  the company is required to retain a cash balance of  through november  at which time the required cash balance will be reduced to  subsequent to the payment or conversion to stock of the november principal payment 
the noteholder will have an option to call the note in full after april  promissory note payable concurrent with the mydoconline acquisition  at closing  sanofi aventis loaned the company  due march   with a stated annual interest rate of 
interest on the note is payable only in services provided by the company to sanofi aventis unless there is an event of default 
the principal portion of the note is payable in either cash or shares of the company s common stock  based on the then current value of such shares  at the option of the company and may be prepaid by the company at any time without penalty 
the principal portion of the note may be paid in the form of services provided to sanofi aventis by the company pursuant to the terms of such services agreement 
it is unlikely that the note will be paid in the form of services 
should the note not be paid in the form of services  the company is required to pay the note in cash or stock at maturity at an amount equal to of the face amount of the loan  or  which the company considers its minimum liability 
short term promissory notes in december  zixcorp issued an month note payable to cananwill to finance the company s commercial insurance policies 
the note matures in november and has a stated interest rate of 
interest and principal payments are due in equal monthly installments 
liquidity summary based on the company s organization and current order rates as of december   the annualized operating spending for is projected to be between  and  the company currently has cash receipt projections for of  to  which combined with  unrestricted cash on hand at december  provides for an estimated  to  in cash available to fund the expected spending for approximately  of the projected cash receipts comes from scheduled payments on binding contracts  estimated secure messaging customer renewals consistent with historic renewal rates  assumed flat year on year new esecure subscription additions  expected transaction fees from existing e prescribing contracts and new deployment levels per quarter in e prescribing similar to the fourth quarter the company estimates  to  in additional projected cash receipts from continued year on year growth in new subscriptions in esecure  from new transaction fee sources  fees from a performance based e prescribing contract and from additional e prescribing sponsorships 
as contractual cash collections and expected increases in cash sources are not always certain  the company has the ability to adjust cash spending to react to any shortfalls in projected cash collections or to adjust spending in certain investment areas should cash receipts make that possible or  if warranted and if the terms are acceptable  with additional external financing  receipts from exercised stock options and warrants of the company s common stock or strategic partnerships 
the company believes it has adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations for and is targeting cash flow improvements to augment its liquidity beyond after considering the following factors relatively low contractual spending commitments in historically high renewal rates for secure messaging continued growth in the secure messaging business increased mix of cash receipts attributable to the more profitable out years of contracts the discretionary nature of the cash spend in excess of cash receipts in the emerging area of e prescribing general flexibility of spending in other areas however  operating in emerging and developing markets involves risk and uncertainties 
there are no assurances that the company will ultimately achieve or achieve in a sufficiently timely manner its targeted cash flow improvements or achieve its operational objectives 
thus  if necessary and if the expected returns warrant it  the company could further augment its cash flow position through additional cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings or a combination of these actions 
operationally  the extent and timing of success and potential returns in the ehealth market will ultimately be the most significant 
table of contents operational determinant of liquidity 
the extent to which the company views the ehealth market as attractive for investment will determine the company s willingness to fund additional operational cash losses 
options and warrants of zixcorp common stock in  the company raised significant cash from individuals who hold warrants and options in the company s common stock as they exercised these warrants and options 
the company continues to have significant warrants and options outstanding that are currently vested 
there is no assurance that any of these options and warrants will be exercised  therefore the extent of future cash inflow from additional warrant and option activity is not certain 
the following table summarizes the warrants and options that are outstanding as of december  the vested shares are a subset of the outstanding shares 
the value of the shares is the number of shares multiplied by the exercise price for each share

the company intends to fully exercise this option to the extent possible 
however  the company currently does not have shareholder approval to issue stock to redeem these balances  therefore  shareholder approval would have to be obtained 
the company s convertible promissory notes have a stated interest rate that is reset every six months based on the six month libor plus basis points 
for the information shown above  the company has assumed that the rate will remain at the current level for the term of the loan and all payments will be made in cash 
actual interest will vary based on changes in the six month libor see note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the share deficiency situation described in note to the consolidated financial statements   of the  of debt noted above is callable at anytime after april and therefore the full  is shown as payable in however  if not called by the investor the required payment dates on the note are  in november and november the company has not entered into any material  non cancelable purchase commitments at december

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb it establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas r requires the fair value based method for measuring and recognizing the cost of stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r replaces the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb and requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires companies to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
companies are also required to use either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies must recognize compensation cost for all awards granted after adoption of the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
under the modified retrospective method  companies must restate previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  companies are permitted to use either a straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
the company is required to adopt sfas r on january   and has elected to use the modified prospective method along with the straight line amortization method for recognizing compensation costs 
the company will also use the short cut method as prescribed in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
to calculate the estimated life of options granted to employees subsequent to december  as a result of the adoption of sfas r  the company will recognize stock based compensation for grants made after january  the company estimates the adoption will have a significant adverse impact on the company s consolidated results of operations similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as it relates to partially vested stock options outstanding as of december   the company estimates it will incur additional expense of   and  in  and respectively
