item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of small molecule cancer therapeutics 
our mission is to research  develop  and commercialize broadly effective cancer drugs with reduced toxicities compared to conventional cancer chemotherapeutics 
our expertise in molecular biology enables us to understand and to affect certain biological processes that are responsible for numerous types of human cancer and thus to treat these diseases 
our chemistry capabilities enable us to incorporate within our products certain pre selected drug like characteristics and a high degree of specificity for cancer cells 
we believe that these qualities  when present from the earliest stages of product development  increase the likelihood of generating safe  effective and marketable drugs 
our lead products are arq  based on our activated checkpoint therapysm platform  and arq  based on our c met cancer survival pathway platform 
enrollment of patients in a phase clinical development program with arq is scheduled to begin in  and patient enrollment in a phase clinical trial with arq began in early we have a number of additional oncology product discovery and development programs in the pre clinical stage 
in september  we announced a strategic decision to exit our pre existing chemistry services business in order to focus operationally on developing our oncology portfolio 
we will continue to provide such services to pfizer inc pfizer under a previous agreement until may  we are retaining and continuing to leverage a broad spectrum of well established chemistry capabilities in the discovery and development of our oncology portfolio 
these capabilities are designed to facilitate the timely progression of our programs from initial discovery through pre clinical development 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million from inception through december  our expenses prior to september related to development activities associated with our chemistry services  the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts  and the cost of acquisitions 
expenses incurred following september also included those related to discovery and pre clinical and clinical development activities in connection with our oncology programs 
we expect research and development costs to increase in  particularly those related to clinical testing of our lead product candidates 
although we have generated positive cash flow from operations for the last seven years  we have recorded a net loss for all but one of those years 
we expect to record a loss for our revenue has been derived from chemistry services performed for customers  primarily pfizer  and research and development funding from our alliance with hoffmann laroche roche 
revenue  expenses and gross margin fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  notably the timing and extent of our cancer related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials  and our chemistry services contractual deliverables and the timing of the recognition of revenue under our revenue recognition policy see the discussion of this under critical accounting policies below 
revenue from our chemistry services business will terminate in as a result of our strategic decision to exit this business and the subsequent decision by pfizer to terminate its collaborative agreement agreement with us effective may  we believe pfizer took such action in response to its changing requirements 
we will not incur any financial penalty as a result of termination 
we will continue to provide chemistry services to pfizer pursuant to the agreement through the effective date of termination 
since december  we produced for pfizer annually an average of approximately  synthetic chemical compounds and received average annual cash payments of approximately million for those compounds and related services 
the agreement provides for six months prior written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and  in the event of termination by pfizer  certain payments to us 
in accordance with these provisions  we received approximately million in december in connection with the termination 
on april  we announced an alliance with roche to discover and develop drug candidates targeting the ef biological pathway  including arq under the terms of the agreement  roche obtained an option to license our ef program in the field of cancer therapy 
roche provided immediate research funding of million  and is providing financial support for ongoing research and development 
under this alliance  we are responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage development to phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  we could receive up to million in pre determined payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
additionally  we have the option to co promote products in the us on january   we completed a stock offering in which we sold million shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million after commissions and offering expenses 
on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn facility and simultaneously lease the facility from the purchaser 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  under the terms of the transaction  the purchaser obtained two parcels of land and our headquarters building in exchange for a cash payment of approximately million  net of commissions and closing costs 
we are leasing our existing facility and the associated land for a period of ten years at an average annual rental rate of million 
liquidity and capital resources december  increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital in millions cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities 
our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices and laboratories  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies and materials  and professional fees 
the sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services 
in  our net source of cash was primarily driven by the difference between the recognition of revenue and the timing of cash receipts from customers  which resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
this amount includes the receipt of million from pfizer in december as a termination payment resulting from their decision to terminate our collaboration on may  the other changes in operating cash flow in  which net to an outflow of million  related to miscellaneous differences between that timing of cash payments and expense recognition and  to a lesser extent  amounts paid as a security deposit on the lease of the woburn facility 
cash flow from investing activities 
our net cash used in investing activities of million in was comprised of net purchases of marketable securities of million and acquisitions of fixed assets of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our woburn headquarters facility  net of commissions and closing costs  of million 
net purchases of marketable securities reflect our investment of the net proceeds from the registered direct stock offering and the sale of the woburn facility 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
cash flow from financing activities 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in was comprised of the net proceeds from our january  stock offering of million  and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of outstanding stock options  partially offset by principal repayments on long term debt and capital lease obligations of million 
we have been cash flow positive from operations for seven consecutive years  although we do not expect to be cash flow positive from operations in as a result of our decision to exit our chemistry services business and the increased cost of developing our clinical candidates 
we expect that our available cash and marketable securities  together with cash from operations and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements for the next two or three years  depending on decisions we may make regarding our clinical trials 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  unanticipated required capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
it is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial  economic and market conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us when required  on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if necessary funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some of our development programs  which could delay the time to market for any of our product candidates 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total included in the total minimum payments for operating leases is approximately million related to unoccupied real estate in california  net of contractual sublease income 
this net amount has been accrued as a liability as a part of the company s restructuring charge in and subsequently adjusted in and see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
for additional information  please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
compound development revenue recognition historically  arqule has entered into various collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which arqule produces and delivers compound arrays and provides research and development services 
revenue elements from collaborative agreements include non refundable technology transfer fees  funding of compound development work  payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting collaborators specific criteria and certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
in each instance  the company analyzes each distinct revenue element of the contract to determine the basis for revenue recognition 
revenue for each element is generally recognized over the period compounds are delivered and or services are performed  provided there is a contractual obligation on behalf of the customer to pay arqule and payment is reasonably assured 
the nature of each distinct revenue element  the facts surrounding the services provided  and arqule s ongoing obligations to provide those services dictate how revenue is recognized for each revenue element 
this accounting conforms to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  in particular staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and is disclosed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in may  the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
eitf became effective for new revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  in february  the company entered into an amended contract with pfizer 
the amendment modified the quantity and composition of compounds to be produced and delivered by arqule  with a corresponding adjustment to the remaining contractual billings for undelivered elements under the contract 
we concluded that the modification was substantial enough to require evaluation of the contract to determine if eitf applied 
we concluded that because the contract does contain multiple deliverables license to technology  research services and compound deliveries eitf did apply 
we determined that there was not sufficient evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements compounds  and therefore the amended contract represented a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
as a result  in q arqule began treating the amended pfizer agreement as a single unit of accounting and recognizing revenue based on the actual delivery of compounds against the estimated total compound deliveries over the remaining term of the contract 
the total estimated number of compounds that arqule delivers to pfizer is based on management s best estimate  changes in estimates of compounds to be delivered to pfizer may result in adjustments to the amount of revenue we recognize per compound delivered 
we follow these guidelines to measure revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of these policies 
for example  in connection with our pfizer collaboration we have recorded current and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
the estimate of deferred revenue reflects our estimate of the timing and extent of services that we will provide to pfizer 
our services to pfizer  and the timing of those services  are difficult to estimate and are impacted by factors outside of our control 
for example  the timing and quantity of compounds we provide is largely dependent on pfizer s internal needs 
changes to estimates could impact the timing and amount of revenue we recognize in the future 
compound development revenue was derived from the following contractual elements in  and in thousands non refundable technology transfer payments funding of compound development payments based on delivery of specialized compounds milestone payments total compound development revenue before  arqule recognized revenue from pfizer based on the individual contractual elements of the collaborative agreement 
as noted above  in as a result of the amended pfizer agreement and the adoption of eitf  the company began to account for pfizer revenue as a single unit of accounting 
in and  pfizer revenue in the above table is fully included in payments based on delivery of specialized compounds 
research and development revenue recognition under the terms of the roche agreement  roche obtained an option to license arqule s ef program in the field of cancer therapy 
roche provided immediate research funding of million  and financial support for ongoing research and development 
arqule is responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage development into phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  arqule could receive up to million in pre determined milestone payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
arqule considers the development portion of the arrangement to be a single unit of accounting under eitf for purposes of revenue recognition  and will recognize the initial and ongoing development payments as research and development revenue over the maximum estimated development period 
we estimate the maximum development period could extend until december  although this period may ultimately be shorter depending upon the outcome of the development work  which would result in accelerated recognition of the development revenue 
milestone and royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the cost associated with satisfying the roche contract is included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
purchase accounting and in process research and development upon consummation of the cyclis acquisition  we immediately charged to income million representing purchased in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
approximately million of the charge represents the fair value of the ipr d  the remaining million of the charge represents the allocation to ipr d of a portion of the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired 
we believe that this charge represents a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributed to purchased ipr d 
the value assigned ipr d before the step up adjustment was the projected value of three cyclis preclinical drug development projects based on various mechanisms of actions associated with the act technology 
the valuation was determined using the income approach 
potential revenue and drug development expenses were projected through based on information obtained from management and from published third party industry statistics for similar drug development businesses 
specifically  we estimated that the development of our current cancer programs through clinical trials to commercial viability could take approximately nine years and cost in excess of million 
the discounted cash flow method was applied to the projected cash flows  adjusted for the probability of success  using a discount rate of 
the discount rate takes into consideration the uncertainty surrounding successful development and commercialization of the ipr d 
since the acquisition  nothing has occurred that would lead us to believe that the original estimates of the cost to develop these compounds  or their revenue potential  is materially different from the estimates used at the time of the acquisition for purposes of purchase accounting 
restructuring charges credits accruals for abandoned facilities under lease require significant management judgment and the use of estimates  including assumptions concerning the ability of a sublessee to fulfill its contractual sublease obligations 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the company s abandoned facility in redwood city  california 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease 
as a result of signing the sublease  we adjusted our accrual for abandoned facilities to reflect the full amount of the anticipated sublease income to be received 
this assumption about the subleasee s ability to fulfill its contractual obligation is based on an analysis of their financial position and ability to generate future working capital 
if the subleasee is unable to meet its obligations  and the company is unable to enter into another sublease for the facility  arqule may be required to adjust its restructuring accrual and record additional restructuring expense of up to million 
investments in non marketable equity securities at december   we performed an assessment of the fair value of our investment in a privately held proteomics company 
this assessment included analysis of that company s current financial condition  its prospects for generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the current market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this initial analysis it was our judgment that an impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was million  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
in the second quarter of  events affecting the financial condition of the company caused us to conclude that the fair value of the investment had further declined  and as such  we recorded a non cash loss on investment of million to write off the remaining carrying value of the investment 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we assess our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances a triggering event indicate that the carrying value of a group of long lived assets may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
on september   we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services business when we had completed our existing agreement with pfizer in we concluded that our intention to exit our chemistry services business was a triggering event and that an impairment review was required 
as a result of that review  we determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services business exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to that business  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended september  on december   we received notice that pfizer had elected to terminate the agreement  pursuant to the agreement s terms  effective may  we concluded that notification from pfizer was also a triggering event and performed a second impairment review 
as a result of this second review  we again determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services business exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to that business  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended december  we are contractually required to perform under the terms of the agreement until may  and  as such  the assets of the chemistry services business are considered held for use at december  although we are actively seeking a potential buyer for the chemistry services business  the uncertainty of us successfully completing a sale transaction within one year  or deciding to abandon the assets  precludes us from classifying the assets of the chemistry services business as assets to be disposed of by sale at december  if it becomes probable that we will sell the chemistry services business  eliminate the associated cash flows  and have no continuing involvement  or we abandon the chemistry services assets and eliminate the associated cash flows with no intention of continuing involvement  we will at that time classify the chemistry services business as assets to be disposed of by sale on our balance sheet  and would report the chemistry services business as discontinued operations in our statements of operations in accordance with sfas based on our decision to exit our chemistry services business  we adjusted the depreciation lives on fixed assets used exclusively in that business in order to fully depreciate the remaining book value of those assets over the remaining period that we will provide services to pfizer 
sale leaseback accounting on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn headquarters facility and two parcels of land in exchange for a cash payment of million  net of commissions and closing costs 
simultaneous with that sale  we entered into an agreement to lease back the entire facility and the associated land 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  the amended lease has a term of ten years with an average annual rental rate of million 
we also have options to extend the lease term for up to an additional ten years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  we are applying sale leaseback accounting to the transaction and are treating the lease as an operating lease 
as a result of this transaction  we reduced our net fixed assets by million  representing the net book value of the assets sold on the date of the lease amendment  and realized a gain on the sale of million  which has been deferred and will be amortized over the initial ten year lease term as a reduction in rent expense 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue increase decrease to to in millions compound development revenue research and development revenue total revenue as compared to compound development revenue in decreased by million  or  from revenue from our chemistry based collaboration with pfizer was million in  approximately million higher than in as discussed earlier  pfizer has decided to terminate its collaboration with arqule effective may  we will continue to produce compounds for pfizer until that date and recognize revenue in based on compounds delivered 
offsetting the increase in compound development revenue from pfizer were reductions in revenue from a wyeth of million due to contractual milestone received in with no comparable revenue in  b novartis of million due to the wind down of this collaboration in february  and c sankyo of million due to this collaboration ending in research and development revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from roche in connection with the alliance agreement 
the increase in research and development revenue in is due to us recognizing nine months of revenue from the roche agreement in compared to months of revenue in as compared to compound development revenue in decreased by million  or  from revenue from our chemistry based collaboration with pfizer was million in  a decrease of million  or  from although the number of compounds delivered to pfizer in was approximately the same as in  in the fourth quarter of arqule received a contractual milestone payment on an accelerated basis which increased revenue 
beginning in  as a result of the amended pfizer agreement and the application of eitf  arqule began recognizing revenue from pfizer based solely on the number of compounds produced and shipped ie all obligations were treated as a single unit of accounting rather than based on individual contractual elements 
see revenue recognition under critical accounting policies and estimates contained herein for more information 
compound development revenue was also lower in due to a reduction in revenue from bayer of million  sankyo of million  pharmacia of million and johnson johnson of million  all the result of contracts which ended at various times in and partially offsetting the decrease was  a million of milestone revenue from wyeth related to the advancement by wyeth of three compounds  the discovery of which were facilitated by a collaboration with arqule  and b an increase in revenue from novartis of million related to a compound development contract entered into in the latter half of that was in effect for all of research and development revenue is comprised of nine months of revenue from roche in connection with the alliance agreement signed in april cost of compound development revenue and gross margin percentage increase decrease to to in millions cost of compound development revenue gross margin of revenue pts pts as compared to cost of compound development revenue decreased by million in primarily due to reduced material cost of million due to conscious efforts to reduce spending and to deplete internal reserves of chemicals and supplies  lower facility costs of million associated with closing our facility in medford  massachusetts  and lower depreciation charges of million resulting from reduced capital spending in new equipment and a lower depreciable basis in our existing equipment 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased rental expenses of million associated with our facility in woburn  which we sold to a third party and leased back in june compound development gross margin percentage was lower in than due primarily to an inflated gross margin percentage in resulting from the inclusion of million of revenue from wyeth in associated with the achievement of contractual milestones for which there was no associated cost of revenue in cost of compound development revenue will decrease in as a result of our decision to exit our chemistry services business after the completion of the pfizer collaboration on may  as compared to cost of compound development revenue decreased in absolute dollars primarily due to reduced material and supply costs necessary to satisfy the bayer  sankyo  pharmacia and johnson and johnson contracts which ended at various times in and  lower depreciation charges resulting from reduced capital spending in new equipment and a lower depreciable basis in existing capital equipment  and a reduction in personnel dedicated to compound development as a result of the amended pfizer collaborative agreement and the corporate restructuring in the first quarter of see restructuring related charges credits below 
compound development gross margin percentage was lower in due partially to a a higher gross margin percentage in as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue from bayer at the end of that contract in for which the associated costs were incurred in prior years and the recognition of a contracted milestone from pfizer on an accelerated basis which increased revenue with no associated cost  and b a lower gross margin percentage in resulting from the lower overall level of revenue available to offset fixed overhead and facility related expenses 
research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development overview our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license  and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of capital resources 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology programs 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis  or the cost to support our alliance agreement with roche 
the expenses incurred by us to third parties for preclinical and clinical trials in and since inception of each program were as follows in thousands oncology program current status program to date ef modulation arq phase ef modulation arq rp program preclinical cancer survival protein modulation arq rp program phase our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future oncology programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology  and efficacy 
we then may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for the preclinical and clinical development of these types of products to each take nine years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term adverse events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad pipeline of products  our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases 
our strategy includes the option of entering in alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreement with roche 
in the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
as compared to the increase in research and development expense in is primarily due to an increase of million in the cost of third party services for pre clinical studies  manufacturing and storage of our clinical candidates and the continued conduct of our phase clinical trials 
we anticipate these third party costs will continue to increase as we further develop our clinical candidates and begin phase clinical studies 
also contributing to the increase were a 
increased personnel related costs of million as we continue to add scientists to further our development efforts  b 
increased laboratory supply costs of million as we continue our experimental testing  and  c 
increased facility related costs of million that reflects the additional costs to accommodate the increasing research and development headcount in addition to the increase in rental expense associated with the sale and leaseback of our woburn facility in june as of december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  up from employees at december  as compared to the increase in research and development expense in primarily consists of an increase in personnel related cost of million related to the hiring of additional scientists and million related to the cost of pre clinical and clinical trials to advance further the ef program 
the cost increases were partially offset by million of costs incurred in related to the recruitment of a key employee and severance paid certain senior managers that were not incurred in at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  up from at december  marketing  general and administrative increase decrease to to in millions marketing  general and administrative compared to marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in  consistent with management s continued efforts to minimize overhead spending 
increases in rent expense associated with the sale and leaseback of the woburn facility were more than offset by lower depreciation expense due to lower capital spending and a lower depreciable asset base and generally lower spending on salaries  employee related costs and corporate insurance 
as compared to marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in in february  we eliminated administrative positions as part of our restructuring actions to reallocate resources to our oncology and drug discovery efforts causing a reduction in personnel and infrastructure expenses of million 
the cost saving associated with these personnel reductions were partially offset by increases in legal expenses of million related to the negotiation of the alliance agreement with roche in the first quarter of and increased costs associated with protecting our intellectual property 
acquisition related charges in millions acquisition related charges acquisition related charges in represent purchased in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use in connection with our acquisition of cyclis 
approximately million of the charge represents the fair value of the ipr d 
the remaining million of the charge represents a step up adjustment resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed which was allocated on a pro rata basis to the carrying value of acquired long lived assets 
see critical accounting policies and estimates above for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant estimates 
restructuring related charges credits in millions restructuring charges credits 
in december  we announced a restructuring of our operations in order to realign our workforce and expedite the transition towards becoming a drug discovery company 
the restructuring actions included closing our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge  united kingdom  along with the termination of employees in these facilities and our massachusetts facilities 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million  including facility related costs of million 
facility related costs relate to the remaining lease payment obligations associated with the abandonment of our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge and the non cash write off of leasehold improvements and equipment no longer expected to provide future economic benefit at the abandoned facilities  less assumed proceeds from sale 
in october  we completed an agreement with inpharmatica ltd 
to sell certain assets of its former operations in the united kingdom 
as a result  we reversed million of restructuring accrual to reflect a change in its original estimate of the remaining lease obligations and assumed sublease income in the united kingdom 
throughout the latter half of  we were in negotiations with a third party to sublease its facility in california on favorable terms 
those negotiations were terminated in january as a result  the adequacy of the accrual relative to the lease obligation and assumed sublease income for the california facility was reassessed  and based on continued deterioration in the local real estate market  an additional provision of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring to shift resources from our chemistry services business to our internal cancer therapy research 
the restructuring included the termination of staff and managerial employees  or approximately of the workforce  in the following areas in chemistry production positions  in chemistry based research and development positions  and in administrative positions 
in connection with these actions we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the first quarter of for termination benefits 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the california facility 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease obligation 
as a result of signing the sublease  we reassessed the remaining restructuring accrual and  since the sublease was on terms more favorable than previously estimated  we recorded a million restructuring credit in the third quarter of activities against the restructuring accrual in and were as follows in thousands balance as of december  provisions credits payments balance as of december  termination benefits facility related other charges total restructuring accrual balance as of december  provisions credits payments balance as of december  facility related the facility related accrual  which represents the difference between the company s lease obligation for its california facility and the amount of sublease payments it will receive under its sublease agreement  will be paid out through on january   our board of directors authorized severance payments for employees in connection with a plan of termination for our chemistry services business 
the severance benefits to be provided each affected employee approximately employees in total will consist of cash payments and continuation of health care coverage 
the amount of each individual employee s benefit will be determined by the employee s service level and tenure with the company 
the agreement cost associated with the plan of termination is estimated to be approximately million  and we will record a restructuring charge in it is expected that the severance benefits will be fully paid by december  we anticipate annualized savings in salaries and employee related costs of approximately million as a result of these actions 
interest income and expense increase decrease to to in millions interest income interest expense interest income  net interest income is derived from our portfolio of cash and short term investments 
interest income increased year to year due to the increased average portfolio balance and to generally higher interest rates 
interest expense decreased in due to lower average debt balances and generally lower interest rates 
interest expense increased in due to interest charges incurred related to the sale of the woburn facility
