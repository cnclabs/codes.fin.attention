item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a multi national integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases 
our lead products are revlimid r  which gained recent fda approval in mds patients with the q chromosomal deletion and is under review by the fda for multiple myeloma and thalomid r thalidomide  which is currently marketed for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum  or enl  and under review by the fda for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
over the past several years  thalomid r net sales have grown steadily driven mainly by its off label use for treating multiple myeloma and other cancers 
the sales growth of thalomid r has enabled us to make substantial investments in research and development  which has advanced our broad portfolio of drug candidates in our product pipeline  including a pipeline of imids r compounds  which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties 
we believe that the sales growth of thalomid r  the growth potential for revlimid r  the depth of our product pipeline  near term regulatory activities and clinical data reported at major medical conferences provide the catalyst for future growth 
factors affecting future results future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products  the timing and market acceptance of new products launched by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones  challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs 
see also the risk factors discussion in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
some of the more salient factors that we are focused on are the ability of revlimid r to successfully penetrate relevant markets  competitive risks  and our ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs 
the ability of revlimid r to successfully penetrate relevant markets revlimid r was approved by the fda on december  for the treatment of certain myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality and we have begun to execute our product launch strategies  which includes among other things registering physicians in the revassist sm program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of revlimid r  sponsoring numerous medical education programs designed to educate physicians on mds  and  partnering with contracted pharmacies to ensure safe and rapid distribution of revlimid r 
in addition  we have implemented an expanded access program to provide patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma free access to revlimid r while the fda reviews our snda for that indication 
we do not  however  have long term data on the use of the product and cannot predict whether revlimid r will gain widespread acceptance  which will mostly depend on the acceptance of regulators  physicians  patients and opinion leaders 
the success of revlimid r will also depend  in part  on prescription drug coverage by government health agencies  commercial and employer health plans  and other third party payers 
as an oral targeted cancer agent  revlimid r qualifies as a medicare part d drug 
each part d plan will review revlimid r for addition to their formulary 
as with all new products introduced into the market  there may be some lag time before being reviewed on each plan s formulary 
we are encouraged that during this formulary review process  patients have been given access to revlimid r and there have been no reported denials for coverage 
competitive risks the landscape for the treatment of multiple myeloma and other cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases is highly competitive 
while competition could reduce thalomid r sales and limit revlimid r launch expectations  we do not believe that competing products will eliminate revlimid r and thalomid r use entirely 
in addition  generic competition could reduce thalomid r sales 
however  we own intellectual property which includes  for example  us patents covering our us r distribution program for the safer delivery of thalidomide  which all patients receiving thalidomide in the united states must follow 
we also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering the use of thalomid r in oncology and other therapeutic areas 
even if generic competition were able to enter the market  we expect revlimid r  which is now available commercially  to at least partially replace thalomid r sales 
ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs a major objective of our on going clinical trials programs is to broaden our knowledge about the full potential of revlimid r and to continue to evaluate the drug in a broad range of indications including lymphocytic leukemia  non hodgkin s lymphoma  amyloidosis and myelofibrosis 
the significant near term regulatory catalysts that we are focused on include the fda s decision regarding our snda for thalomid r in multiple myeloma a prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  date of may  has been set  the fda s decision regarding our snda for revlimid r in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma  and from an international perspective  the european medicines agency  or emea  decision regarding our marketing authorization application  or maa  for revlimid r in mds with the q chromosomal deletion 
company background in  we were spun off from celanese corporation and in july we completed an initial public offering 
initially  our operations involved research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
between and  our revenues were derived primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development 
by  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and  in january we sold the chiral intermediates business to cambrex corporation 
in july  we received approval from the fda to market thalomid r for use in enl  a complication of the treatment of leprosy  and in september we commenced sales of thalomid r in the united states 
since then  sales of thalomid r have grown significantly each year 
in  and we recorded net thalomid r sales of million  million and million  respectively 
in april  we signed a licensing and development agreement with novartis pharma ag in which we granted to novartis a license for focalin tm  our chirally pure version of ritalin r 
the agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the regulatory approval process 
it also provided for us to receive royalties on the entire family of ritalin r products 
pursuant to the agreement we retained the rights to focalin tm and focalin xr tm in oncology indications 
in august  we acquired signal pharmaceuticals  inc  now celgene research san diego  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease 
in november  we licensed to pharmion corporation exclusive rights relating to the development and commercial use of our intellectual property covering thalidomide and steps r in all countries outside of north america  japan  china  taiwan and korea see our references below to the december amendment with respect to these territories 
in december  we acquired anthrogenesis corp  a privately held biotherapeutics company developing processes for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a successful full term pregnancy for use in stem cell transplantation  regenerative medicine and biomaterials for organ and wound repair 
in march  we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  to distribute  promote and sell alkeran r  or melphalan  a therapy approved by the fda for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary 
the agreement requires that we purchase alkeran r from gsk and distribute the products in the united states under the celgene label 
the agreement has been extended through march  in october  we acquired penn t limited  or penn t  a worldwide supplier of thalomid r 
through manufacturing agreements entered into with a third party in connection with this acquisition  we are able to control manufacturing for thalomid r worldwide and we also increase our participation in the potential sales growth of thalomid r in key international markets 
in december  following our acquisition of penn t  we amended the thalidomide supply agreement with pharmion and granted them license rights in additional territories 
as amended  the territory licensed to pharmion is for all countries other than the united states  canada  mexico  japan and all provinces of china other than hong kong 
on december   the fda approved revlimid r for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities 
until  we had sustained losses in each year since our incorporation in for the years ended december   and we posted net income of million  million and million  respectively  and at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to make substantial additional expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products 
we expect that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of increases in clinical trial costs  expenses associated with regulatory approval and expenses related to commercialization of products currently in development 
however  we anticipate these expenditures to be more than offset by increased product sales  royalties  revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and investment income 
stock split on december   we announced that the board of directors approved a two for one stock split payable in the form of a percent stock dividend 
stockholders received one additional share for every share they owned as of the close of business on february  the additional shares were distributed on february  as a result  our authorized shares increased from  to  and shares outstanding increased from  shares to  shares as of the close of business on february  all share and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split effective february  results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue total revenue and related percentages for the years ended december   and  were as follows change to to in thousands net product sales thalomid r    focalin tm    alkeran r    revlimid r  n a other total net product sales    collaborative agreements and other revenue    royalty revenue    total revenue    net product sales compared to thalomid r net sales were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to price increases implemented as we move towards a cost of therapy pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram 
sales volumes decreased due to lower average daily doses  however  the total number of prescriptions for remained essentially flat when compared to the prior year period 
partially offsetting the increase in thalomid r sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and distributor chargebacks  which are recorded based on historical data 
included in were sales of million from our uk subsidiary  cuk ii  to pharmion corporation 
focalin tm net sales  which are dependent on the timing of orders from novartis for their commercial distribution  were essentially flat when compared to the prior year period 
alkeran r net sales were higher in  as compared to  due to price increases implemented during and an increase in sales volumes 
alkeran r use in combination therapies for the treatment of hematological diseases continues to grow driven by clinical data reported at major medical conferences around the world 
also contributing to the increase in alkeran r sales volumes was the resolution of supply disruptions experienced in  which resolution led to more consistent supplies of alkeran r for injection and consequently more consistent end market buying patterns 
revlimid r was approved by the fda on december  and the first commercial sales were recorded relating to initial stocking at certain contracted pharmacies that were registered under the revassist tm program 
other net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications  which are generated through our celgene cellular therapeutics division 
compared to thalomid r net sales were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to price increases implemented in the second half of and in the first nine months of the total number of prescriptions  which increased from the prior year period  was offset by lower average daily doses 
focalin tm net sales were higher in  as compared to  due to the timing of shipments to novartis for their commercial distribution 
alkeran r net sales were lower in  as compared to  due to supply disruptions earlier in the year  which lead to inconsistent supplies of alkeran r iv and consequently inconsistent end market buying patterns 
other net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications  which are generated through our celgene cellular therapeutics division 
gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  sales discounts  medicaid rebates and distributor charge backs and services 
allowance for sales returns are based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned 
sales discounts accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization 
distributor charge back accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor services accruals are based on actual fees paid to wholesale distributors for services provided 
medicaid rebates and distributor charge backs increased due to higher sales volumes and price increases  which increase the respective rebate and chargeback amounts 
the gross to net accrued balances were million and million at december  and  respectively

royalty revenue in and was million and million  respectively  and consisted solely of royalties received from novartis on sales of their entire family of ritalin r drugs 
the year over year increases in ritalin r royalty revenue was due to increases in the royalty rate on both ritalin r and ritalin r la as well as an increase in ritalin r la sales by novartis 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands cost of goods sold    increase from prior year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of net product sales compared to cost of goods sold were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to higher royalties on thalomid r net sales and higher alkeran r costs as a result of higher sales volumes

as a percentage of net product sales  however  cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower alkeran r costs 
profit margins on thalomid r remained flat  as the increase in cost of goods sold resulting from higher royalties paid were offset by higher net sales which were due to price increases implemented in the second half of and in the first nine months of research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor fees paid principally to contract research organizations to assist in our clinical development programs  costs of drug supplies for our clinical and preclinical programs  costs of other consumable research supplies  regulatory and quality expenditures and allocated facilities charges such as building rent and utilities 
research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands research and development expenses    increase from prior year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenue compared to research and development expenses were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to higher costs to support further clinical development and regulatory advancement of revlimid r phase ii and phase iii programs in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma  including the ongoing pivotal phase iii mds deletion q trial to support our maa seeking approval to market revlimid r in europe 
research and development expenses are targeted to increase to percent in in support of our ongoing global regulatory filings  late stage clinical trials and clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs 
compared to research and development expenses increased by million in from  primarily due to increased spending in various late stage regulatory programs such as phase ii regulatory programs for revlimid r in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma  including ongoing revlimid r phase iii spa trials in multiple myeloma 
research and development expenses in consisted of million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  million spent on other pharmaceutical programs  including toxicology  analytical research and development  drug discovery  quality assurance and regulatory affairs  million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs

as total revenue increases  research and development expense may continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue  however the actual dollar amount may continue to increase as earlier stage compounds are moved through the preclinical and clinical stages 
due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects  the cost to complete such projects can vary 
the data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent a project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development  which would significantly impact the costs incurred to bring a project to completion

equity in losses of affiliated companies on march   we exercised warrants to purchase  shares of entremed  inc common stock 
since we also hold  shares of entremed voting preferred shares that are convertible into  shares of common stock  we determined that we have significant influence over entremed and are applying the equity method of accounting to our common stock investment effective march  under the equity method of accounting  we recorded equity losses of million in  which includes a charge of million to write down the value of the investment ascribed to in process research and development  million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets  million to record our share of entremed losses and a charge of million to eliminate our share of thalomid r royalties payable to entremed  inc during  we recorded million for our share of the entremed losses until the investment was written down to zero in the third quarter of on february  we  along with a group of other investors  entered into an agreement to invest million in entremed in return for newly issued entremed common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of entremed common stock at a conversion price of per warrant 
our portion of the investment was million for which we received  shares of entremed common stock and  warrants 
the warrants will be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and primarily reflects interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the million convertible notes issued on june  interest expense in only includes seven months of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs 
income tax benefit provision the income tax provision for was million and reflects tax expense impacted by certain expenses incurred outside the united states for which no tax benefits can be recorded offset by the benefit from elimination of valuation allowances totaling million as of march   which was based on the fact that we determined it was more likely than not that certain benefits of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
this determination was based upon the external independent data monitoring committee s  or idmc  analyses of two phase iii special protocol assessment multiple myeloma trials and the conclusion that these trials exceeded the pre specified stopping rule 
the idmc found a statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression the primary endpoint of these phase iii trials in patients receiving revlimid r plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone alone 
this  in concert with our nine consecutive quarters of profitability  led to the conclusion that is was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
the elimination of valuation allowances relating to certain historical acquisitions were first offset against goodwill and intangibles with the balance applied to reduce income tax expense 
the elimination of valuation allowances relating to tax deductions that arose in connection with stock option exercises were offset against components of equity 
the income tax provision for was million  which reflects an effective underlying tax rate of 
our tax rate in rose from primarily due to federal tax expense and decreases in the valuation allowance available to offset income tax expense 
in  our income tax provision was million and included income tax expense of million for federal and state purposes  offset by a tax benefit of million from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards

at december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  a decrease of million from december  levels 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a reduction in unrealized gains on our available for sale marketable securities portfolio 
we expect increased research and product development costs  clinical trial costs  expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products and capital investments 
in addition  we expect increased commercial expenses  such as marketing and market research 
however  existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale  combined with expected net product sales and revenues from various research  collaboration and royalties agreements are expected to provide sufficient capital resources to fund our operations for the foreseeable future

new accounting principles in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
 as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  sfas no 
permitted entities to continue to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
we will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal year management is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note  nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for the pro forma impact on net income and net income per share from calculating stock based compensation cost under the fair value method of sfas no 
however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas no

in december  in recognition of the significance of the revlimid r regulatory approval  the board of directors approved a resolution to grant the annual stock option awards in pursuant to the stock incentive plan  or the plan  and the non employee directors incentive plan 
all stock options awarded pursuant to the plan were granted fully vested  with half issued at an exercise price  or strike price  of per option and the other half issued at a strike price of per option  which was at a premium to the closing price of per share  adjusted for the february  two for one stock split  of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on the grant date of december  the board s decision to grant these options was in recognition of the revlimid r regulatory approval and in response to a review of our long term incentive compensation programs in light of changes in market practices and recently issued changes in accounting rules resulting from the issuance of fasb no 
r  which we are required to adopt effective the first quarter of management believes that granting these options prior to the adoption of fasb no 
r will result in our not being required to recognize cumulative compensation expense of approximately million for the four year period ending december  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities

we are in compliance with these requirements and continue to monitor these developments to assess the possible impact on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition on collaboration agreements we have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements 
the agreements are for both early and late stage compounds and are focused on specific disease areas 
for the early stage compounds  the agreements are relatively short term agreements that are renewable depending on the success of the compounds as they move through preclinical development 
the agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events  and in some cases ongoing research funding 
the agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives fda marketing approval 
our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  or sab in addition  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force issue  or eitf   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  eitf provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
in accordance with sab  upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period of the last item of performance to be delivered 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process are recognized when and if the milestones are achieved 
gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and chargebacks we record an allowance for sales returns based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned 
we record sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to customers 
we record medicaid rebate accruals based on historical payment data and estimates of medicaid beneficiary utilization 
we record distributor charge back accruals based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
we record distributor services accruals based on actual fees paid to wholesale distributors for services provided 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security established 
factors evaluated to determine if an investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  or business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market condition in which the issuer operates  the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment  and  issues that raise concerns about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
at the end of  we determined that two securities with an amortized cost basis of million had sustained an other than temporary impairment and recognized a million impairment loss  which was recorded in interest and other income  net 
accounting for long term incentive plans the recorded liability for long term incentive plans was million as of december  plan payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the plan  to of the participant s salary for the plan and to of the participant s salary for the plan 
the performance cycle was approved by the management compensation and development committee of the board of directors on january  and began on january  and will end on december   or the plan

the estimated payout for the plan is million and maximum potential payouts are million  million and million for the  and plans  respectively 
the company accrues the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  our accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or  if higher  an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at december   our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale and unsecured convertible notes issued by us 
the company may periodically utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
at december   we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to buy us dollars and sell swiss francs for a notional amount of million 
the forward contract expires on april  and is an economic hedge of a us dollar payable of a swiss foreign entity  which is remeasured through earnings each period based on changes in the spot rate 
the unrealized loss on the forward contract  based on its fair value at december   was approximately million  and was recorded in accrued expenses with the offsetting loss recorded in earnings 
assuming that the year end exchange rates between the us dollar and the swiss franc were to adversely change by a hypothetical ten percent  the change in the fair value of the contract would decrease by approximately million 
however  since the contract hedges foreign currency payables  any change in the fair value of the contract would be offset by a change in the underlying value of the hedged item 
marketable securities available for sale at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted of us government agency securities  mortgage backed obligations  corporate debt securities and  shares of pharmion common stock 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  are held for an indefinite period of time and are intended to be used to meet our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of all debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses  is included in interest and other income  net 
at the end of  we determined that two securities with an amortized cost basis of million had sustained an other than temporary impairment and recognized a million impairment loss related to these securities due to reductions in their future estimated cash flows 
as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows duration less than to to to over in thousands year years years years years total principal amount       fair value       average interest rate n a pharmion common stock at december   we held a total of  shares of pharmion corporation common stock  which had an estimated fair value of approximately million based on the closing price reported by the national association of securities dealers automated quotations  or nasdaq system  and  which exceeded the cost by approximately million 
the amount by which the fair value exceeded the cost ie  the unrealized gain was included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the pharmion common stock investment is subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease in pharmion s common stock quoted market price will have a similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment 
convertible debt in june  we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of unsecured convertible notes 
the convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of payable semi annually 
the convertible notes can be converted at any time into  shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of per share for more information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of million by approximately million  which we believe reflects the increase in the market price of our common stock to per share  on a split adjusted basis  as of december  assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally results in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value  and an increase in our stock price generally results in an increase in the fair value of convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value
