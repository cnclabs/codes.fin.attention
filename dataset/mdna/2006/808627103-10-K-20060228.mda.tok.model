risks and uncertainties that could cause our forward looking statements to fail to occur include  but are not limited to the following we may not attain expected revenues and earnings  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining third party payor contracts for our products  we may experience reductions in sales levels and may fail to reach anticipated sales levels  if demand for our products exceeds our initial expectations or the ability of our suppliers to provide demand meeting quantities of product and samples  our future ability to sell these products could be adversely impacted  the potential growth rate for our promoted products may be limited by slower growth for the class of drugs to which our promoted products belong and unfavorable clinical studies about such class of drugs  we may encounter problems in the manufacture or supply of our products  for which we depend entirely on third parties  strong competition exists in the sale of our promoted products  which could adversely affect expected growth of our promoted products sales or increase our costs to sell our promoted products  we may not be able to protect our competitive position for our promoted products from patent infringers  altoprev has experienced manufacturing issues 
if the issues recur and cannot be resolved  our ability to acquire the product for sale and sampling will be adversely affected  sales of our tanafed and robinul products have been adversely affected by the introduction of knock off and generic products  respectively  an issued fda notice may cause us to incur increased expenses and adversely affect our ability to continue to market and sell our tanafed products  we may incur unexpected costs in integrating new products into our operations  we may be unable to develop or market line extensions for our products including prenate  sular  triglide  altoprev and fortamet  or  even if developed  obtain patent protection for our line extensions  further  introductions by us of line extensions of our existing products may require that we make unexpected changes in our estimates for future product returns and reserves for obsolete inventory  if these risks occur  our operating results would be adversely affected  our licensor supplier can terminate our rights to commercialize nitrolingual and the dose size of this product has not yet met our expectation  we depend on a small senior management group  the departure of any member of which would likely adversely affect our business  an adverse interpretation or ruling by one of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results  a small number of customers account for a large portion of our sales and the loss of one of them  or changes in their purchasing patterns  could result in substantially reduced sales  substantially and adversely impacting our financial results  if third party payors do not adequately reimburse patients for our products  doctors may not prescribe them  side effects or marketing or manufacturing problems with our products could result in product liability claims which could be costly to defend and could result in the withdrawal or recall of products from the market  we rely on operational data obtained from ims  an industry accepted data source 
ims data may not accurately reflect actual prescriptions for instance  we believe ims data does not capture all product prescriptions from some non retail channels  an adverse judgment in the securities class action litigation in which we and certain current and former directors and executive officers are defendants could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity  if we fail to obtain  or encounter difficulties in obtaining  regulatory approval for new products or new uses of existing products  or if our development agreements are terminated  we will have expended significant resources for no return  our business and products are highly regulated  the regulatory status of some of our products makes these products subject to increased competition and other risks  and we run the risk that we  or third parties on whom we rely  could violate the governing regulations  if generic competitors that compete with any of our products are introduced our revenues may be adversely affected  and some unforeseen difficulties may occur

other 
other loss increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in other loss is the result of the sale of marketable securities for the purchase of the licensing rights for altoprev and fortamet 
provision benefit for income taxes 
income taxes were provided for at a rate of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this increase is related to the changes in jurisdications in which we do business and the effect of the international operations 
years ended december  and december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million  to million for  compared to million for this increase was primarily the result of management s redefined corporate strategy  which included an increase in sales force from approximately sales professionals to approximately sales professionals and an increased emphasis on hospital and managed care contracts 
these changes resulted in an increase in sular total dispensed prescriptions according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data and the successful launch of prenate elite  which was the newest member to the prenate family  in april prenate elite captured of the market share for new prescriptions and of the market share of total prescriptions for the month of december  according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data 
in  revenues were also adversely affected as a result of the company s limitation on sales in order to reduce the level of wholesaler inventory for the first half of the year 
in late  our wholesaler customers purchased what we believe to be excessive levels of inventory of our products in anticipation of future price increases 
this adversely impacted our sales in the first half of as a result of limiting shipments to wholesalers in the first half of and thereby attempting to reduce the amount of inventory held by the wholesalers  unit sales decreased from the first half of compared to the first half of prior to developing systems in  we first learned of the wholesalers increasing the trade levels of inventory in mid december upon receiving the ims health pipeline report  which was a report provided by ims health incorporated that provides information on inventory levels held by certain major wholesalers 
this report indicated that wholesaler inventory levels were higher than we expected 
this additional inventory was purchased by the wholesalers prior to our january product price increases  allowing these wholesaler customers to increase the prices they charge their retail customers in the first quarter of  thereby improving their margins for these products 
in response  in the second and third quarters of  we entered into inventory management agreements with our three largest wholesale customers to encourage the wholesaler s to maintain on average one month of inventory

cost of revenues increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs was due primarily to the increase in net revenues 
as a result of a change in our sales forecast  cost of revenues for the year ended december  included an increased allowance for obsolete and excess inventory of million 
these charges were primarily for our non promoted products  excess sular and tanafed inventory and short dated prenate gt inventory 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  do not include a comparable allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
gross margin 
gross margins for and were 
net sales for included a higher proportion of hospital and managed care prescriptions which have a lower per unit revenue

cost of revenues for the year ended december  do not include a comparable allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the increase in sales force  increased accounting fees related to the sarbanes oxley requirements  as well as increased royalties related to the increased sales 
this increase was partially offset by lower selling expenses resulting from the company s revised strategy and operating plan 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  to million for  compared to million for this increase resulted from higher depreciation expense related to our implementation of a disaster recovery system and a new sales tracking system in impairment charge 
in the second quarter of  the company formulated a new sales and marketing strategy upon the company hiring mr 
patrick fourteau as its then president and chief operating officer 
this new strategy resulted in the discontinuation of the pursuit of a line extension for cognex as well as the subsequent plans to promote the product 
as part of this new strategy  using market research  the company updated its forecasts of cognex sales projections to reflect a life cycle through june  the period of time that the company expects it will continue to sell the product in the future 
as a result  the estimated useful life of cognex was decreased from a remaining life of years to years  and using the estimated future undiscounted cash flows over the useful life of the product  the intangible asset related to cognex was not projected to be recoverable 
to determine a fair value of the intangible asset related to cognex  the company performed an internal analysis utilizing a number of factors  including information from an independent valuation 
the company s analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million being recorded as of june  the methodologies used to determine a fair value for cognex included a combination of a market approach  which used a marketable multiple methodology and a comparable transaction methodology  as well as an income approach  using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the company believes there were no other intangible asset impairments and there were no other asset write downs as of december  research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense was primarily a result of costs incurred in associated with manufacturing transfers for our ponstel  cognex and furadantin products and development costs for the prenate line 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  do not include comparable expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the issuance of a total of million  senior subordinated contingent convertible notes in march for the year ended december   the company had no debt outstanding 
interest income 
interest income increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in interest income for year ended december  was primarily due to a higher average cash and marketable securities balances as a result of the proceeds from the issuance of the contingent convertible senior subordinated notes in march  as well as positive cash flows generated from operations during provision benefit for income taxes 
income taxes were provided for at a rate of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in the effective rate for the year ended december  is due to the change in the mix of tax jurisdictions  both domestic and international as a result of our implementation of international operations where our income was earned  as well as a change in the ratio of non deductible expenses to pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from working capital requirements  product development activities  funding of acquisitions and debt service 
we expect to need additional funds to acquire or obtain licenses for new products  develop and test new products and potentially to acquire other businesses  which may increase our cost of capital 
we may seek funding through public and private financing and may seek to incur debt  issue shares of our stock  or both  either to finance a transaction or as consideration for a transaction 
adequate funds for these purposes  whether through the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available when we need them or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds could cause us to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product acquisitions  licensing opportunities  marketing programs  product development programs  potential business acquisitions and manufacturing opportunities 
we have historically met these cash requirements through cash from operations  borrowings and the issuance of common stock 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this providing of cash resulted from the net income for the year of million adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization of million  non cash deferred income tax benefit of million  decrease in income tax receivable of million as a result of increased taxable income  increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  and other miscellanous non cash transactions of million 
these providers of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million which resulted from our increased sales  other current assets and other assets of million related primarily to increased samples for our new products  inventories of million related to increased levels for our products and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million

these providers of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  other current assets and other assets of million  inventories of million and income taxes receivable of million 
we maintain supply agreements with third party suppliers for all of our products 
some of these supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements 
for most of these supply agreements  we believe that our inventory requirements and related purchases of inventory will exceed the minimum purchase requirement in in those cases in which we do not believe our purchases will exceed the minimum purchase requirements  we are seeking to negotiate waivers or modifications of the minimum purchase requirements 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  which was million 
the primary use of cash for investing activities was the purchase of product licenses of million for triglide  fortamet and altoprev  the purchase of marketable securities of million and the purchase of plant and equipment of million 
this use of cash was partially offset by the sales of marketable securities of million which was used primarily for the purchase of triglide  fortamet and altoprev 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  which was million 
the primary use of cash for investing activities was the purchase of marketable securities of million

the agreement required us to pay million to skyepharma plc upon signing the agreement and up to an additional million was payable thereafter  all of which were contingent upon milestones related to fda approval 
we have incurred an additional million in acquisition costs related to the skyepharma plc agreement 
we also used million for the purchase of property and equipment  primarily for a new sales force automation system 
our business strategy includes the acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products and businesses that we believe represent attractive growth opportunities for us in the future 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
subject to our liquidity and capital resources at any particular time  we may incur commitments in the future to acquire or license pharmaceutical products and businesses 
net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash from financing activities in was the repurchase of common stock of million 
this was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash used by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the primary provider of cash from financing activities was the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million and from the issuance of common stock  primarily from the exercise of stock options  of million 
these providers of cash were offset by million in incurred financing costs related to the debt issuance  million for the repurchase of common stock which was subsequently retired and million for the acquisition of treasury stock which was acquired in part  to establish a pool of authorized shares that will be available for contribution to the employee stock ownership plan over time as the company in its discretion deems appropriate 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash we expect to generate from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund these working capital requirements  at least for the next twelve months 
however  in the event that we make significant acquisitions  we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities  or both 
some of our supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements 
we do not expect that meeting those requirements will result in the acquisition of excessive inventory 
we expect we will also experience growth in our accounts receivable as our sales increase 
in march  we issued a total of million of our contingent convertible senior subordinated notes 
the notes are due march  and accrued interest is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  commencing on september  in addition to the interest in the notes  after march   we will also pay contingent interest during specified six month periods if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five day trading period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
during any period when contingent interest is payable  it will be payable at a rate equal to per annum 
the net proceeds from this issuance after deducting offering expenses were approximately million

we expect the impact of seasonality to continue to decrease as we acquire or obtain licenses for products that treat chronic conditions 
however  we anticipate that the seasonality may continue to affect sales of certain existing products for the foreseeable future 
sales of our cough and cold products for the years ended december   and accounted for  and  respectively  of our total sales for such year 
critical accounting policies we view our critical accounting policies to be those policies which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to estimate the level of accounts receivable recorded on our balance sheet which will ultimately not be paid 
among other things  this assessment requires analysis of the financial strength of our customers  which can be highly subjective  particularly in the recent difficult general economic environment 
our policy is to estimate bad debt expense based on prior experience supplemented by a periodic customer specific review when needed 
if we over or under estimate the level of accounts receivable that will not be paid  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
sales deductions 
we provide volume rebates  contractual price reductions with drug wholesalers and insurance companies  and certain other sales related deductions on a regular basis 
the exact level of these deductions is not always immediately known and thus we must record an estimate at the time of sale 
our estimates are based on historical experience with similar programs  and since we have a relatively small customer base  customer specific historical experience is often useful in determining the estimated level of deductions expected to be refunded to our customers when sales incentives are offered 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales deductions  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
our return policy conforms to industry standard practices 
we believe that we have sufficient data to estimate future returns over the revised time period at the time of sale 
management is required to estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
management periodically reviews the reserves established for returns and adjusts them based on actual experience 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
liabilities assumed with the acquisition of product rights 
in connection with the acquisition of product rights  we assume certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  we estimate the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and include that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we review the estimated liability on an annual basis 
if we over or under estimate liabilities assumed  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
when we acquire the rights to manufacture and sell a product  we record the aggregate purchase price  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
we use the assistance of valuation experts to help us allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets that we have acquired 
then  we must estimate the economic useful life of each of these intangible assets in order to amortize their cost as an expense in our statement of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related asset 
the factors that drive the actual economic useful life of a pharmaceutical product are inherently uncertain  and include patent protection  physician loyalty and prescribing patterns  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  future introductions of competing products not yet fda approved  the impact of promotional efforts and many other issues 
we use all of these factors in initially estimating the economic useful lives of our products  and we also continuously monitor these factors for indications of appropriate revisions 
in assessing the recoverability of its intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we review intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances may include but are not limited to  lack of promotional sensitivity  the introduction of competitive products and changes in government regulations 
if we determine that an intangible asset is impaired  a non cash impairment charge would be recognized 
if we should incur an impairment loss  there may be a material impact to the financial statements 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in international  federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
inventory obsolescence 
our products have shelf lives ranging from to months 
we must estimate the amount of inventory recorded on our balance sheet that will not be sold prior to expiration 
this estimate requires analysis of forecasted demand for our products  our promotional focus  amounts of our products currently held by our customers and the impact on our products of competing products 
if we over or under estimate the amount of inventory that will not be sold prior to expiration  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this interpretation would apply to all open tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 including those acquired in business combinations 
it is a proposed asset recognition approach to apply a dual threshold for uncertain tax positions 
the interpretation would allow the recognition of a tax benefit when it is probable that it could be sustained upon audit 
the interpretation defines probable as it is defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
while they have not addressed the effective date  it will not be effective for year ended under their current plans 
the company is currently reviewing the effect  if any  the proposed guidance will have on its financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
the standard requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is deemed impracticable  unless the change in accounting relates to the principle method of depreciation  amortization or depletion for long lived  non financial assets in which case the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
the standard is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the standard is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and eliminates the exception under abp opinion no 
for an exchange of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the standard is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement revised  share based payment 
the standard eliminates the disclosure only election under fas and requires the recognition of compensation expense for stock options and other forms of equity compensation based on the fair value of the instruments on the date of grant 
sfas r is effective for equity compensation expense in fiscal years beginning after december  and we will adopt it prospectively on january  see note for the disclosures of the pro forma dilutive impact on net income and earnings per share of expensing stock options based on the black scholes model 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that arise in the ordinary course of business 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure is presented below 
foreign currency exchange risk our purchases of nitrolingual from pohl boskamp  our purchases of triglide from skyepharma and our purchases of sular from bayer are made in euros or are otherwise impacted by fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
although we did not enter into any forward contracts in  we may eliminate risks from foreign currency fluctuations after the time of shipment of product by entering into forward contracts for these purchases of inventory at the time of product shipments 
the company s earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
market risk on investments the fair value of our investment portfolio would be negatively affected by an increase in interest rates 
since the majority of the company s investments are fixed rate interest bearing securities and therefore subject to the market risk of loss in market value from an increase in rates or a change in the underlying risk of the issuers of the notes  the company s future earnings and cash flows could be affected adversely if the company were to sell the securities prior to their maturity date 
there were million in realized losses from sale of investments in the year ended december  at december   the company had total net unrealized losses from marketable securities of million 
market risk on variable rate debt in connection with borrowings incurred under the senior secured revolving credit facility arranged by lasalle bank  na  we could experience market risk with respect to changes in the general level of the interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at variable rates 
because such rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
accordingly  our present exposure to interest rate fluctuations is primarily dependent on rate changes that may occur while borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are outstanding 
as of february  there was no debt outstanding under this facility 
market risk on fixed rate debt the company s long term fixed interest rate senior subordinated contingent convertible notes are also subject to market risk 
fixed rate debt outstanding at december  was million with an interest rate of 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s fixed rate debt will increase as rates decline and will decrease as rates rise 
the fixed rate notes outstanding totaling million at december  had a fair value of million based on quoted market rates
