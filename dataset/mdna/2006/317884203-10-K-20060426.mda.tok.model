executive overview our business we are one of the leading retailers of fine jewelry in the united states and primarily operate licensed fine jewelry departments in major department stores where we sell a broad selection of moderately priced jewelry  with an average sales price of approximately per item 
we also operate specialty jewelry stores which sell luxury priced jewelry  with an average sales price of approximately  per item 
as of january   we operated a total of  locations  including finlay departments in host store groups  in states and the district of columbia  as well as carlyle specialty jewelry stores in nine states  located principally in the southeastern united states 
our primary focus is to offer desirable and competitively priced products a breadth of merchandise assortments and to provide superior customer service 
our ability to quickly identify emerging trends and maintain strong relationships with vendors has enabled us to present better assortments in our showcases 
with respect to our licensed department store business  we believe that we are an important contributor to each of our host store groups and we continue to seek opportunities to penetrate the department store segment 
by outsourcing their fine jewelry departments to us  host store groups gain our expertise in merchandising  selling and marketing jewelry and customer service 
additionally  by avoiding high working capital investments typically required o f the traditional retail jewelry business  host stores improve their return on investment and increase their profitability 
as a licensee  we benefit from the host stores reputation  customer traffic  credit services and established customer base 
we also avoid the substantial capital investment in fixed assets typical of a stand alone retail format 
in recent years  on average  approximately of our merchandise has been carried on consignment  which reduces our inventory exposure to changing fashion trends 
these factors have generally led our new departments to achieve profitability within the first twelve months of operation 
in may  we completed the acquisition of carlyle and its subsidiaries carlyle currently operates specialty jewelry stores located primarily in the southeastern united states under the carlyle co  je caldwell co 
and par k promenade trade names 
the carlyle stores are principally located in shopping malls and lifestyle centers and focus on the designer and high end jewelry markets 
the carlyle stores offer a compelling shopping environment for the high end luxury consumer and focus on watches  gold  designer jewelry  diamonds and precious gemstones  complemented by an assortment of giftware 
carlyle strives to provide its customers with a premier shopping experience by utilizin g knowledgeable  professional and well trained sales associates  marketing programs designed to promote customer awareness of its merchandise assortments and extending credit to its customers through its credit card programs  which are managed by a third party 
carlyle s results of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition 
we measure ourselves against key financial measures that we believe provide a well balanced perspective regarding our overall financial success 
those benchmarks are as follows  together with how they are computed o diluted earnings per share eps net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding and share equivalents included to the extent they are dilutive which is an indicator of the returns generated for our shareholders  o comparable department sales growth computed as the percentage chang e in sales for departments open for the same months during the comparable periods 
comparable department sales are measured agains t our host store groups as well as other jewelry retailers  o total net sales growth current year total net sales minus prior year total net sales divided by prior year total net sales equals percentage change which indicates  among other things  the success of our selection of new store locations and the effectiveness of ou r merchandising strategies  and o operating margin rate income from operations divided by net sales which is an indicator of our success in leveraging our fixed costs and managing our variable costs 
key components of income from operations which management focuses on include monitoring gross margin levels as well as continued emphasis on leveraging our sg a 
highlights during  our finlay departments achieved a growth in comparable department sales  with our strongest performances in our bloomingdale s store group  belk s and parisian  a division of saks 
over the past decade  through the successful execution of our marketing and merchandising strategy  we have experienced comparable department sales increases in nine out of ten years an d we have consistently outperformed our host store groups with respect to these increases 
we attribute our success to an experienced and stable management team  a well trained and highly motivated sales force  an expert jewelry merchandising team  unique vendor relationships and an established customer base 
also contributing to our success are our merchandising and inventory control systems and point of sale systems for our locations  which provide the foundation for improved productivity 
total sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of 
total sales for included million of sales generated by carlyle 
gross margin increased by million in compared to  and  as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased by from to 
approximately of the decreas e was associated with the addition of carlyle as its margins are typically lower than the gross margins related to the finlay departments due to carlyle s stron g emphasis on the watch category 
although sg a increased by million  as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased from to  primarily as a result of carlyle s significantly lower rent structure as a percentage of sales compared to that of finlay s licensed department business 
during  we continued to effectively manage our inventories and implement appropriate expense controls 
our operating cash flow was million in  which enabled us to open new locations and remodel and expand existing locations 
we ended with million of cash compared to million at the end of this decrease was attributable to the acquisition price paid for carlyle of approximately million and paydown of its revolving credit facility of approximately million 
additionally  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were reduced to zero by the end of january the average outstanding balance under the revolving credit agreement increased to million during as compared to million i n the prior year  primarily as a result of additional borrowings to finance the acquisition of carlyle in may and to fund carlyle s working capital requirements 
lastly  maximum outstanding borrowings during peaked at million  at which point the available borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were an additional million 
in november  we signed a new agreement with federated  effective at the beginning of  for four macy s divisions including macy s south  macy s midwest  macy s north and macy s northwest 
this new agreement is three years i n length and expires january  approximately stores are covered by this agreement 
the agreement has no impact on the bloomingdale s and lord taylor divisions whose license agreements  which cover a total of departments  currently run through february  during  the bon ton announced its intention to purchase the northern department store group of saks which includes carson pirie scott  bergner s  boston store  younkers and herberger s 
the transaction closed in march we continue to operate the fine jewelry departments in these host store groups 
opportunities we believe that current trends in jewelry retailing provide a significant opportunity for our growth 
consumers spent approximately billion on jewelry including both fine jewelry and costume jewelry in the united states in calendar year  an increase of approximately billion over  according to the united states department of commerce 
in the department store and specialty jewelry store sectors in which we operate  consumers spent an estimated billion on fine jewelry in calendar year our management believes that demographic factors such as the maturing u 
s population and an increase in the number of working women  have resulted in greater disposable income  thus contributing to the growth of the fine jewelry retailing industry 
our management also believes that jewelry consumers today increasingly perceive fine jewelry as a fashion accessory  resulting in purchases which augment our gift and special occasion sales 
the new agreement signed with federated in november eliminates all non compete provisions from the previous may contracts that required us to obtain may s permission before opening a new department or store within a certain radius of a may store 
we believe that the elimination of this non compete provision provides us with significantly greater opportunity to expand our business and continue to diversify beyond the traditional department store sector 
an important initiative and focus of management is developing opportunities for our growth 
we consider it a high priority to identify new businesses that offer growth  financial viability and manageability and will have a positive impact on shareholder value 
as discussed above  we completed the acquisition of carlyle in may in  we tested moissanite merchandise moissanite is a lab created stone with greater brilliance and luster than a diamond in certain departments this category of merchandise generated sales of approximately million in in  more than of our departments will carry moissanite which we estimate will generate sales of approximately million during additional growth opportunities exist with respect to opening departments within existing host stores that do not currently operate jewelry departments 
such opportunities exist within dillard s and belk s 
over the past three years we have added departments in dillard s and belk s and we plan to add departments within these host store groups in additionally  we plan to open ten departments with federated  including three bloomingdale s stores  two stores that will be transferred to us from macy s east and two stores that will be transferred to us from macy s west 
further  we plan to open one new carlyle store in and project opening an additional three in through expandin g in new bloomingdale s departments and carlyle stores  we will have a larger portion of our business dedicated to the high end luxury sector 
we will continue to seek to identify complementary businesses to leverage our core competencies in the jewelry industry and plan to continue to pursue th e following key initiatives to further increase sales and earnings o increase comparable department sales  o identify and acquire new businesses which diversify our existing businesses and provide additional growth opportunities  o open new channels of distribution  o add new host store relationships  o add departments within existing host store groups  o add new carlyle stores  o capitalize on developing fashion trends and emerging merchandise categories  o expand our most productive departments  o continue to improve operating leverage  o continue to raise customer service standards  and o de leverage the balance sheet

impairment of goodwill 
during the quarter ended july   federated announced its intention to divest  beginning in  certain stores in which w e operate the fine jewelry departments 
based upon this business indicator  we utilized our sfas no 
model to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as o f july  as a result  we determined that goodwill was impaired and an impairment of million  on a pre tax basis  was recorded during interest expense  net 
interest expense increased by million primarily due to an increase in average borrowings million for the period in compared to million in as a result of additional borrowings to finance the acquisition of carlyle in may and to fund carlyle s working capital requirements offset by the refinancing of the old senior debentures and the old senior notes during the weighted average interest rate was approximately for compared to for other expense

lifo net decrease in the lifo provision from million in the period to million in the period 
as discussed below  we changed our method of valuing inventory for lifo purposes 
total during the third quarter of  we changed our method of determining price indices used in the valuation of lifo inventories 
prior to the third quarter of  we determined our lifo inventory value by utilizing selected producer price indices published for jewelry and watches by the bureau of labor statistics bls 
during the third quarter of  we began applying internally developed indices that we believe more accurately measure inflation or deflation in the components of our merchandise and our merchandise mix than the bls producer price indices 
additionally  we believe that this accounting change is an alternative accounting method that is preferable under the circumstances described above 
as a result of this change in accounting method  we recorded a lifo charge of approximately million for the year ended january  using the bls producer price indices  the lifo charge for the year ended january  would have been million 
had we not changed ou r method of determining price indices  the net income and net income per diluted share under the former lifo method for the year ended january  would have been approximately million or per share  on a diluted basis

liquidity and capital resources information about our financial position is presented in the following table january  january  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents   working capital   long term debt   stockholders equity a   a the stockholders equity balance at january  reflects a charge of approximately million  net of tax  related to the impairment of goodwill 
our primary capital requirements are for funding working capital for new locations and growth of existing locations  as well as debt service obligations and license fees to host store groups  rent payments for the carlyle stores  funding potential acquisitions  and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures for opening new locations  renovating existing locations and information technology investments 
for and  capital expenditures totaled million and million  respectively 
total capital expenditures for ar e estimated to be approximately to million  including carlyle 
although capital expenditures are limited by the terms of the revolving credit agreement to date  this limitation has not precluded us from satisfying our capital expenditure requirements 
we currently expect to fund capital expenditure requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of cash  internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
we believe that our internally generated liquidity through cash flows from operations  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans and will provide adequate financing flexibility 
cash flows provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  were as follows fiscal yea rs ended january  januar y  january  dollars in thousands operating activities  investing activities  financing activities  net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  our current priorities for the use of cash or borrowings  as a result of borrowings available under the revolving credit agreement  are o investment in inventory and for working capital  o strategic acquisitions  o capital expenditures for new locations  expansions and remodeling o f existing locations  and o investments in technology 
operating activities the primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operating activities 
the key component of operating cash flow is merchandise sales 
operating cash outflows include payments to vendors for inventory  services and supplies  payments for employee payroll  license fees  rent and payments of interest and taxes 
net cash flows from operations were million in and were impacted by the extension of a deferred billing program with the forme r may groups  where we receive settlement for certain sales over a twelve month period  resulting in an increase in accounts and other receivables of approximately million over last year 
additionally  accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased over last year as a result of the acquisition of carlyle 
further  current deferred taxes increased by approximately million  of which approximately million was attributed to the purchase of carlyle and the remaining million was primarily the result of tax lifo and expenses not currently deductible 
long term deferred tax liabilities decreased by approximately million  of which approximately million was attributed to the acquisition of carlyle 
the remaining difference was primaril y the result of a change in book vs 
tax depreciation and the impairment of tax deductible goodwill 
our principal operations involving licensed fine jewelry departments substantially preclude customer receivables as our license agreements typically require host stores to remit sales proceeds for each month without regard to whether such sales were cash  store credit or national credit card to us approximately three weeks after the end of such month 
however  we cannot ensur e the collection of sales proceeds from our host stores 
additionally  on average approximately of our merchandise has been carried on consignment 
our working capital balance was million at january   an increase of million from january  the seasonality of our business causes working capital requirements  and therefore borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  to reach their highest level in the months of october  november and december in anticipation o f the year end holiday season 
accordingly  we experience seasonal cash needs as inventory levels peak 
additionally  substantially all of our license agreement s provide for accelerated payments during the months of november and december  which require the host store groups to remit to us of the estimated months sales prior to or shortly following the end of that month 
these proceeds resul t in a significant increase in our cash  which is used to reduce our borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
inventory levels increased by million  or  as compared to january   primarily as a result of th e acquisition of carlyle  whose inventory levels were million as of january investing activities net cash used in investing activities  consisting of the acquisition of carlyle in may  which accounted for million of cash invested in as well as payments for capital expenditures  were million  million and million in  and  respectively

financing activities payments on debt have been our primary financing activities 
net cash use d in financing activities was million in consisting principally of the paydown of carlyle s revolving credit facility in conjunction with the acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  consisting principally of proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes by finlay jewelry and funds received from stock option exercises  offset by the purchase and redemption of the then outstanding old senior debentures and the old senior notes  the repurchase of  shares of common stock for approximately million under our stock repurchase program which expired in september and capitalized financing costs of million related to the refinancing of the old senior debentures and the old senior notes 
net cash use d in financing activities was million in principally related to the repurchase of  shares for approximately million under our stock repurchase program  partially offset by funds received from stock option exercises 
our revolving credit agreement  which matures in january  provides u s with a line of credit of up to million to finance working capital needs 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rat e equal to  at our option  i the prime rate plus a margin ranging from zero to or ii the adjusted eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to  in each case depending on our financial performance 
the weighted average interest rate was and for and  respectively 
in each year  we are required to reduce the outstanding revolving credit balance and letter of credit balance under the revolving credit agreement to million or less and million or less  respectively  for a consecutive day period the balance reduction requirement 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at january  and january  were zero 
the average amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement during and were million and million  respectively 
the maximum amount outstanding during was million  at which point the available borrowings were an additional million 
at january  and january   we had letters of credit outstanding totaling million and million  respectively  which guarantee various trade activities 
in august  federated announced that it had completed a merger with may 
in september  federated announced its integration plans including a divisional realignment and divestiture of certain stores 
accordingly  effectiv e as of the beginning of  we now operate a total of departments in six o f federated s nine divisions  which excludes departments in stores that are scheduled to be closed throughout the spring season 
as a result  the fall season will be significantly impacted by the loss of business at these locations 
in  we generated sales of approximately million from these departments 
in  we recorded charges associated with accelerated depreciation of fixed assets and severance totaling approximately million related to these departments 
we intend to record additional charges totaling approximately million related to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets  field and executive and administrative office severance and other closing related expenses through the dates of the final store closings  estimated to occur by july in may  we completed the acquisition of carlyle 
the purchase price was approximately million  plus estimated transaction fees of approximately million  and was financed with additional borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the acquisition  carlyle s revolving credit facility was terminated and paid in full at the closing 
since the date of the purchase  carlyle s cash requirements have been  and we expect will continue to be  funded under finlay s revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the acquisition  we replaced the existing revolving credit agreement and entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with ge capital and certain other lenders and finlay jewelry entered into the gold consignment amendment to  among other things  permit the acquisition transaction 
in addition  carlyle and its subsidiaries  together with finlay jewelry  entered into the supplemental indentures to guarantee obligations of finlay jewelry under the senior notes 
during  we and finlay jewelry each commenced an offer to purchase fo r cash our old senior debentures and finlay jewelry s old senior notes  respectively 
holders of approximately and of the outstanding old senio r debentures and the outstanding old senior notes  respectively  tendered their securities and consented to amendments to the related indentures 
additionally  during  finlay jewelry completed the sale of the senior notes and called for the redemption of all of the untendered old senior debentures and old senio r notes  respectively  and these securities were repurchased in july interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on june and december of each year 
finlay jewelry incurred approximately million in costs  including million associated with the sale of the senior notes  which were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the senior notes 
in june  we recorded pre tax charges of approximately million  including million for redemption premiums paid on the old senior debentures and the old senior notes  million to write off deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of the old senior debentures and the old senior notes and million for other expenses 
these costs are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january the tender offers  senior notes offering  and redemptions of the outstanding old senior debentures and old senior notes were all undertaken to decrease our overall interest rate  extend our debt maturities and decrease total long term debt as well as simplify our capital structure by eliminating debt at the parent company level 
as a result of the completion of the redemption of the old senior debentures  finlay jewelry is no longer required t o provide the funds necessary to pay the higher debt service costs associated wit h the old senior debentures 
a significant amount of our operating cash flow will be used to pay interest with respect to the senior notes and amounts due under the revolving credit agreement  including the payments required pursuant to the balance reduction requirement 
as of january   our outstanding borrowings were million under the senior notes 
our agreements covering the revolving credit agreement and the senior notes each require that we comply with certain restrictive and financial covenants 
in addition  finlay jewelry is a party to the gold consignment agreement  which also contains certain covenants 
although finlay jewelry is in compliance with its financial covenants as of january   as a result of the federated may merger and the impact of the merger on our future results of operations  finlay jewelry has amended its financial covenants for with respect to the revolving credit agreement and the gold consignment agreement 
because compliance is based  in part  on our management s estimates and actual results can differ from those estimates  there can be no assurance that finlay jewelry will be in compliance with the covenants in the future or that the lenders will waive or amend any of the covenants should finlay jewelry be in violation thereof 
we believe the assumptions used are appropriate 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary covenants  including limitations on  or relating to  capital expenditures  liens  indebtedness  investments  mergers  acquisitions  affiliate transactions  management compensation and the payment of dividends and other restricted payments 
the revolving credit agreement also contains various financial covenants  including minimum earnings and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and certain maximum debt limitations 
the indenture related to the senior notes contains restrictions relating to  among other things  the payment of dividends  redemptions or repurchases of capital stock  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the making of certain investments  the creation of certain liens  the sale of certain assets  enterin g into transactions with affiliates  engaging in mergers and consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all assets 
we believe that  based upon current operations  anticipated growth and continued availability under the revolving credit agreement  finlay jewelry will  for the foreseeable future  be able to meet its debt service and anticipated working capital obligations and to make distributions sufficient to permit us to pay certain expenses as they come due 
no assurances  however  can be given that finlay jewelry s current level of operating results will continue or improve or that finlay jewelry s income from operations will continue to be sufficient to permit finlay jewelry to meet its debt service and other obligations 
currently  finlay jewelry s principal financing arrangements restrict the amount of annual distributions from finlay jewelry to us 
the amounts required to satisfy the aggregate of finlay jewelry s interest expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our long term needs for external financing will depend on our rate of growth  the level of internally generated funds and the ability to continue obtaining substantial amounts of merchandise on advantageous terms  including consignment arrangements with our vendors 
at january  and january  million and million  respectively  of consignment merchandis e from approximately vendors was on hand

there were no commercial commitments outstanding as of january   other than as disclosed in the table above  nor have we provided any third party financial guarantees as of and for the year ended january  off balance sheet arrangements finlay jewelry s gold consignment agreement enables finlay jewelry to receive consignment merchandise by providing gold  or otherwise making payment  to certain vendors 
while the merchandise involved remains consigned  title to the gold content of the merchandise transfers from the vendors to the gold consignor 
in july  finlay jewelry further amended the gold consignment agreement to  among other things  extend the maturity date to october  october  should our revolving credit agreement be extended on terms acceptable to the gold consignor and to establish new financial covenants including minimum earnings and fixed charge ratio requirements and certain maximum debt limitations 
the gold consignment agreement permits finlay jewelr y to consign up to the lesser of i  fine troy ounces or ii million worth of gold  subject to a formula as prescribed by the gold consignment agreement 
at january   amounts outstanding under the gold consignment agreement totaled  fine troy ounces  valued at approximately million 
the average amount outstanding under the gold consignment agreement was million in in the event this agreement is terminated  finlay jewelry would be required to return the gold or purchase the outstanding gold at the prevailing gold rate in effect on that date 
for financial statemen t purposes  the consigned gold is not included in merchandise inventories on the consolidated balance sheets and  therefore  no related liability has been recorded 
the gold consignment agreement requires finlay jewelry to comply with certain covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness  the creation of liens  engaging in transactions with affiliates and limitations on the payment of dividends 
in addition  the gold consignment agreement also contains various financial covenants  including minimum earnings and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and certain maximum debt limitations 
although finlay jewelry is in compliance with its financial covenants as of january   as a result of the federated may merger and the impact of the merger on our future results of operations  finlay jewelry ha s amended its financial covenants for with respect to the revolving credit agreement and the gold consignment agreement 
we have not created  and are not party to  any off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
w e do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
other activities affecting liquidity in november  we entered into an employment agreement with a senior executive 
the employment agreement has a term ending on january   unless earlier terminated  in accordance with the provisions of the employment agreement 
the agreement provides an annual salary level of approximately million as well as incentive compensation based on meeting specific financial goals 
in june  we entered into employment agreements with three senior executives of finlay jewelry and in march  we entered into an employment agreement with a fourth senior executive of finlay jewelry 
each of the agreements has a term of three years  unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the employment agreements 
the agreements provide for annual salary levels totaling approximately million  incentive compensatio n based on meeting specific financial goals and a special bonus equal to of each executives salary if  in the case of the june agreements  he or she is employed by finlay jewelry on june   and in the case of the march agreement  if the executive is employed by finlay jewelry on february  in march  we also entered into an agreement with another senior executive of finlay jewelry who was relocated as a result of the federated may merger 
from time to time  we enter into forward contracts based upon the anticipated sales of gold product in order to hedge against the risk arising from our payment arrangements 
at january   we had two open positions i n gold forward contracts totaling  fine troy ounces  to purchase gold for million 
there can be no assurance that these hedging techniques will be successful or that hedging transactions will not adversely affect our results o f operations or financial position 
a significant change in prices of key commodities  including gold  could adversely affect the company s business by reducing operating margins and impacting consumer demand if retail prices are increased significantly 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of our sales and income from operations generated during the fourth quarter of each year  which includes the year end holiday season 
the fourth quarter of and accounted for an average of approximately of our sales and approximately of our income from operations  exclusive of the goodwill impairment charge of million for we have typically experienced net losses in the first three quarters of our fiscal year 
during these periods  working capital requirements have been funded by borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
accordingly  the results for any of the first three quarters of any given fiscal year  taken individually or in the aggregate  are not indicative o f annual results

restatement of the interim consolidated statements of cash flows subsequent to the issuance of the our interim consolidated financial statements for the twenty six and thirty nine week periods ended july  and october   respectively  we determined that the payment of certain debt assumed in the carlyle acquisition was recorded as an operating activity rather than a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
as a result  the consolidated statements of cash flows for the thirteen weeks and twenty six weeks ended july  and thirty nine weeks ended october will be restated to reflect the repayment of the debt in accordance with sfas no 
 statement of cash flows as cash used in financing activities rather than operating activities 
we anticipate correcting this in our form q filings for the second and third quarters of a summary of the effects of the restatement on cash flows provided by used in operating and financing activities in these statements of cash flows are as follows in thousands as previously reported adjustment as restated thirteen weeks ended july  net cash used in operating activities  net cash provided by financing activities  twenty six weeks ended july  net cash used in operating activities  net cash provided by financing activities  thirty nine weeks ended october  net cash used in operating activities  net cash provided by financing activities  inflation the effect of inflation on our results of operations has not been materia l in the periods discussed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically re evaluated  as appropriate  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
however  since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from our estimates  and such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that we believe are most critical may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined by the lifo method utilizing an internally generated index 
we determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
actua l annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year may differ from interim estimates  and  as such  estimates are adjusted in the fourth quarter of each year 
factors related to inventories  such as future consumer demand and the economy s impact on consumer discretionary spending  inventory aging  ability to return merchandise to vendors  merchandise conditio n and anticipated markdowns  are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
an adjustment is recorded to reduce the lifo cost of inventories  if required  to their estimated net realizable values 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors above could have a significant impact on the value of the inventories and our reported operating results 
during the third quarter of  we changed our method of determining price indices used in the valuation of lifo inventories 
prior to the third quarter of  we determined our lifo inventory value by utilizing selected producer price indices published for jewelry and watches by the bls 
during the third quarter of  we began applying internally developed indices that we believe more accurately measure inflation or deflation in the components of our merchandise and our specific merchandise mix than the bls producer price indices 
additionally  we believe that this change in accounting principle is a n alternative accounting method that is preferable since the internal indices are representative of our actual merchandise mix of inventory  as opposed to the producer price indices  which are broader  more general inflation indices 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in lifo that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we estimate inventory shrinkage for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the reporting period on a store by store basis 
our inventor y shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for estimating shrinkage 
as of january   our shrink reserve totaled million  compared to million as of january  additionally  during both and  inventory shrinkage amounted to approximately of sales vendor allowances we receive allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including cooperative advertising 
vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales upon the sale of merchandise or sg a when the purpose for which the vendor funds were intended to be used has been fulfilled 
accordingly  a reduction in vendor allowances received would increas e our cost of sales and or sg a 
vendor allowances have been accounted for in accordance with eitf vendor allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor s products are recorded as an sg a reduction when the cost is incurred 
all other vendor allowances are initially deferred with the deferred amounts recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of vendor allowances ha s been reflected as a reduction to cost of sales 
as of january  and january   deferred vendor allowances totaled i million and million  respectively  for owned merchandise  which allowances are included as an offset to merchandise inventories on the consolidated balance sheets  and ii million and million  respectively  for merchandise received on consignment  which allowance s are included as deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators i s based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  or o store closings 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we recognize an impairment loss at the time the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets is less than its carrying value 
we measure impairment losses as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
to the exten t future cash flows are less than anticipated  additional impairment charges may result 
there have been no adjustments to earnings resulting from the impairmen t of long lived assets for we also review the estimated useful lives of the assets and reduce such lives if necessary 
during  we recorded charges of approximately million related to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets as a result of the store closings resulting from the federated may merger 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the sale of merchandise  either owned or consigned  to our customers  net of anticipated returns 
the provision for sale s returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
as of january  and january   our allowance for sales returns totaled million adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision has been insignificant for and self insurance reserves other than with respect to our carlyle operations  we are self insured fo r medical and workers compensation claims up to certain maximum liability amounts 
although the amounts accrued are determined based on an analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amounts that we will ultimately disburs e could differ materially from the accrued amounts 
self insurance reserves aggregated million and million at january  and january   respectively 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  income taxes must be accounted for by the asset liability method 
the income tax effects of all revenues  expenses  gains  losses and other events that create differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their amounts for financial reporting are required to be recognized 
inherent in the measurement of these tax effects are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to the company s operations 
our effective tax rate considers management s judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which it is subject to tax 
at any given time  multiple tax years are open to audit by various taxing authorities 
the recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustmen t upon audit  changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates 
accounting for acquisitions in may  we completed the acquisition of carlyle 
carlyle currently operates specialty jewelry stores  located primarily in the southeastern united states 
the acquisition of carlyle has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
as such  we have undertaken an analysis of the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  and determined the excess of fair value of net assets acquired over cost 
we utilized estimates to determine the fair value of inventory and certain acquisition costs 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based paymen t transactions 
sfas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
we will adopt sfas no 
r for the first quarter of and we expect to recognize approximately million of compensation expense in on january   the company s compensation committee of the board of directors approved accelerating the vesting of all out of the money  unvested stock options held by employees and independent directors 
an option was considered out of the money if the stated option exercise price was greater tha n the closing price of our common stock on the day before the compensation committee approved the acceleration 
unvested options to purchase approximately  shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
the vesting acceleration did not result in the recognition of compensation expense for as a result of the acceleration  expected compensation expense in was reduced by approximately million  on a pre tax basis
