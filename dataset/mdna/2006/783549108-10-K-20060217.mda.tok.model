overview ryder system  inc ryder  is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions 
our business is divided into three business segments  which operate in extremely competitive markets 
our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality  price  technology and service offerings 
as an alternative to using our services  customers may also choose to provide these services for themselves  or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors 
our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive  electronics  high tech  telecommunications  industrial  consumer goods  paper and paper products  office equipment  food and beverage  general retail industries  and governments 
the fleet management solutions fms business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing  contract maintenance  contract related maintenance  and commercial rental of trucks  tractors and trailers to customers in the us  canada and the us fms revenue and assets in were billion and billion  respectively  representing of our consolidated revenue and of consolidated assets 
the supply chain solutions scs business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting and lead logistics management solutions throughout north america and in latin america  europe and asia 
scs revenue in was billion  representing of our consolidated revenue 
the dedicated contract carriage dcc business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in north america 
dcc revenue in was million  representing of our consolidated revenue 
as discussed in more detail throughout our md a  during our total revenue was billion  up from billion in all business segments contributed to the total revenue growth 
the growth in fms revenue was driven by increased fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices and better rental revenue due to stronger pricing 
the growth in scs revenue was driven primarily by increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation as well as new and expanded business in all industry groups 
the growth in dcc revenue was driven by new and expanded business  and pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs 
comparisons for were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations

all business segments contributed to the strong results 
the earnings growth was driven primarily by improved fms commercial rental performance  higher gains on fms used vehicle sales and reductions in operating expenses resulting from ongoing cost reduction activities and process improvement actions across all business segments 
capital expenditures increased to billion compared with billion in the increase in capital spending reflects higher vehicle replacements primarily related to the fms lease product line 
our debt to equity ratio increased to from in total obligations including off balance sheet debt to equity ratio increased to from in the increases in leverage ratios were driven by our increased funding requirements as a result of higher vehicle capital spending  higher income tax payments and stock repurchases 
we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock in for million 
we also increased our annual dividend by to per share 
over the past several years we have made significant transformations in our business  addressing many of the fundamental business processes throughout the organization 
from to  we reduced our cost structure and strengthened our balance sheet in order to deliver long term results to our shareholders and also to make ryder more competitive in the marketplace 
during  we were successful in growing revenue in our transactional businesses and through strategic acquisitions in our fms business 
during  we continued this transformation by demonstrating profitable growth in each of our three business segments and realizing record earnings for the second consecutive year 
in  targeted plans for driving growth across all product lines while continuing to demonstrate earnings leverage include focus on strong customer retention and new business development  accelerate growth in fms full service lease and contract maintenance product lines  continue growth in scs  dcc and fms commercial rental product lines  continue emphasis on prudent capital allocation manage capital over replacement cycle  utilize balance sheet capacity to replenish fleet and support growth objectives  and sustain focus on cost management and process improvements  while investing in sales and operational capabilities 
items affecting comparability between periods accounting changes as discussed in note  accounting changes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  effective december   ryder adopted financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
the adoption of fin required us to record an asset retirement obligation related to the future removal of underground storage tanks located at our maintenance facilities 
we recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million on an after tax basis  or per diluted common share 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to significantly impact future results 
as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies consolidation of variable interest entities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  effective july   ryder consolidated three variable interest entities vies in connection with the adoption of fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised by fin r issued december 
the consolidated vies were established as part of previous sale leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment in which ryder sold revenue earning equipment to special purpose entities and then leased the revenue earning equipment back as lessee under operating lease arrangements 
in connection with the sale leaseback transactions executed in the form of vehicle securitizations and a synthetic leasing arrangement  we provided credit enhancements and residual value guarantees that obligated ryder to absorb the majority of the expected losses from such entities  if any are realized 
therefore  fin required that these entities be consolidated 
the consolidation of the vies did not have a significant impact on our consolidated net earnings  however  reported depreciation expense  equipment rental and interest expense were impacted by the consolidation of the vies 
in addition  both net cash provided by operating activities and our free cash flow measure increased beginning july due to the add back of depreciation expense on the vies revenue earning equipment and net cash used in financing activities also increased due to principal payments on vies debt 
we recognized a cumulative effect charge upon adoption of million on an after tax basis  or per diluted common share 
fms acquisitions on march   we completed an asset purchase agreement with ruan leasing company ruan under which we acquired ruan s fleet of approximately  vehicles  of its service locations and more than customers 
ryder also acquired full service contract maintenance agreements covering approximately  vehicles 
effective december   we also acquired substantially all the assets of general car and truck leasing system general  a major privately held commercial truck leasing  maintenance and rental company  including general s fleet of approximately  vehicles  of its service locations and more than customers 
the combined networks operate under ryder s name and have allowed us to leverage our existing us infrastructure in key markets while adding new infrastructure to strengthen our presence in targeted areas of the midwest  southeast  mid atlantic and southwest 
the results of these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated results of ryder since the dates of acquisitions

years ended december change dollars in thousands revenue fleet management solutions supply chain solutions dedicated contract carriage eliminations total all business segments reported revenue growth in additionally  revenue comparisons for all business segments were favorably impacted by pricing increases associated with higher fuel costs which increased fuel services revenue 
fms revenue was also positively impacted by higher rental revenue resulting from stronger pricing and increased contract related maintenance revenue from the implementation of growth initiatives 
scs revenue growth was primarily related to increased volumes of managed subcontracted transportation 
in addition  scs and dcc revenue grew in due to new and expanded business 
revenue comparisons were also impacted by favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations 
total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of due primarily to the strengthening of the canadian dollar and brazilian real 
during  fms revenue was positively impacted by acquisitions and higher rental revenue resulting from a larger fleet  stronger pricing and increased activity 
fms acquisitions contributed approximately million for the year ended december  revenue comparisons were also impacted by increased fms fuel services revenue primarily as a result of higher average fuel prices  and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations 
total revenue included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of due to the strengthening of the british pound and the canadian dollar 
these increases were partially offset by reduced fms full service lease revenue in our base us business excluding acquisitions and the non renewal of certain customer contracts in our scs and dcc business segments 
our fms segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel  maintenance and other ancillary services to our scs and dcc segments 
eliminations relate to inter segment sales that are accounted for at approximate fair value as if the sales were made to third parties 
the increases in eliminations in and reflects the pass through of higher fuel costs from the fms segment to scs and dcc 
years ended december change dollars in thousands operating expense exclusive of items shown separately percentage of revenue operating expense grew for and principally from higher fuel costs due to higher average fuel prices 
fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices 
the overall growth in revenue  excluding fuel  also 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contributed to the increases in operating expense in and for  operating expense was also impacted by higher maintenance costs  resulting from a larger and older vehicle fleet  and added operating costs attributed to the fms acquisitions 
years ended december change dollars in thousands salaries and employee related costs percentage of revenue salaries and employee related costs grew for compared with as a result of headcount added to support the growth in our scs business segment  which was offset slightly by reduced performance based incentive compensation and lower employee benefit costs 
average headcount increased in compared with the number of employees at december  increased to approximately  compared with  at december   primarily due to the growth in our scs business segment 
pension expense decreased million in to million compared with and principally impacted fms 
the decrease in pension expense reflects the positive impact of higher actual pension asset returns in we expect pension expense on a pre tax basis to increase approximately million to million in our pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of actuarial analysis for all pension plans 
see the section titled critical accounting estimates pension plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates 
the anticipated increase in pension expense would primarily impact our fms business segment 
salaries and employee related costs decreased in compared with as a result of lower pension expense and lower headcount in our scs and dcc business segments caused by the non renewal of certain contracts  offset in part by higher performance based incentive compensation 
average headcount decreased in compared with years ended december change dollars in thousands subcontracted transportation percentage of revenue subcontracted transportation represents freight management costs on logistics contracts for which we purchase transportation from third parties 
during  subcontracted transportation expense in our scs business segment grew due to increased volumes of freight management activity from new and expanded business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs  resulting from increased fuel costs 
subcontracted transportation expense increased in compared with principally as a result of added transportation management based business and higher average pricing on subcontracted freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs 
years ended december change dollars in thousands depreciation expense gains on vehicle sales  net equipment rental 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued depreciation expense relates primarily to fms revenue earning equipment 
the growth in depreciation expense during is due to higher vehicle replacement activity within our truck and tractor fleets as well as the conversion of leased vehicles to owned status  partially offset by a decline in our average trailer fleet size 
the growth in depreciation expense during reflected the consolidation of vies effective july  approximately million  the impact of vehicles added as part of the fms acquisitions  the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units 
the improvements in gains on vehicle sales in and were due to an increase in the number of units sold combined with improved average pricing on vehicles sold over the preceding periods 
we periodically review and adjust residual values  reserves for guaranteed lease termination values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment based on current and expected operating trends and projected realizable values 
see the section titled critical accounting estimates depreciation and residual value guarantees for further discussion 
while we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate  there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur  resulting in losses on sales 
equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in fms 
the decrease in equipment rental in from is due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles when compared with the significant decrease in compared with was due to a reduction in the average number of leased vehicles compared with owned resulting from the consolidation of vies effective july  approximately million  the conversion of leased units to owned status as a result of lease extensions and the replacement of expiring leased units with owned units

prior to the consolidation of vies effective july   miscellaneous income  net also included servicing fee income for administrative services provided to vehicle lease trusts in connection with vehicle securitization transactions 
miscellaneous income  net increased in compared with due to the one time recovery of million for project costs incurred in prior years and better market performance of investments classified as trading securities used to fund certain benefit plans 
miscellaneous income  net decreased in compared with because of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the elimination of servicing fee income related to certain vies 
as a result of consolidating the vehicle securitization trusts  we no longer recognize service fee income 
years ended december dollars in thousands restructuring and other charges recoveries  net activity during  ryder recorded net restructuring and other charges of million that consisted of employee severance and benefits  contract termination costs  and closure of leased facilities partially offset by reversals of prior year severance and employee related accruals 
the majority of these charges were recorded during the fourth quarter and related primarily to the restructuring of our uk operations  and the offshoring of some administrative finance and support functions that will allow for future cost savings 
we expect to realize annual pre tax cost savings of approximately million from the fourth quarter actions  which are expected to be completed in the second half of during  ryder approved a plan to eliminate approximately positions as a result of ongoing cost management and process improvement actions in ryder s domestic and international fms and scs business segments and central support services css 
the charge related to these actions included severance and employee related costs totaling million 
cost reductions associated with these actions will benefit salaries and employee related costs beginning in the first quarter of many of the eliminated positions in our domestic operations were impacted by ryder s decision to outsource certain administrative finance functions to lower cost foreign providers and maximize our technology resources 
transition actions will begin in february and continue through the remainder of we also closed two administrative offices in the us as a result of the restructuring of our fms domestic business operations and recorded a charge for future cash payments related to lease obligations

as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the elimination of ohio s corporate franchise income tax over the next five years resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred income taxes 
the effective tax rate includes a net tax benefit of million associated with the completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for the to period  partially offset by provisions made for loss contingencies related to the through period

fuel services revenue  which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices  is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices

during the fourth quarter of  we also restructured our fms operations to better service customers and drive future growth in full service lease 
contract maintenance revenue decreased as a result of lost business 
contract related maintenance revenue  which generally represents ancillary services supporting core product lines  benefited from ongoing initiatives aimed at growing these service offerings

cash provided by operating activities decreased in compared to due to us federal income tax payments of million made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the to tax period and million of estimated and tax payments made during cash provided by operating activities increased in compared with due primarily to improved operating performance and the add back of depreciation expense attributed to vies that were consolidated effective july  cash provided by financing activities increased in compared with cash used in financing activities in due to higher debt borrowings used to fund increased capital requirements and federal income tax payments 
cash used in financing activities decreased in compared with as higher debt borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises were partially offset by increased stock repurchases 
net cash used in investing activities increased in compared with due primarily to higher capital expenditures  principally lease vehicle spending for replacement and expansion of customer fleets 
the increase in capital spending was partially offset by lower acquisition related payments and higher proceeds associated with sales of used vehicles 
cash used in investing activities increased in compared with due to higher capital expenditures and payments made in connection with fms acquisitions 
capital expenditures increased in due to planned higher levels of vehicle replacements for equipment under lease to our customers and new lease sales 
the increase in capital spending was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of used vehicles  the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions completed during we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment as the principal sources of liquidity 
we refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities as free cash flow 
although free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  we consider it to be an important measure of comparative operating performance 
we believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations 
our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 
the following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation years ended december in thousands net cash provided by operating activities collections on direct finance leases sales of operating property and equipment sales of revenue earning equipment sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment purchases of property and revenue earning equipment acquisitions other  net free cash flow we used million of free cash flow in compared to generating million in due to higher capital spending levels and income tax payments made in connection with the resolution of our federal income tax audit for the to tax period and estimated tax payments which were partially 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued offset by lower acquisition spending 
free cash flow decreased in compared with as higher capital spending and payments made in connection with fms acquisitions offset better operating performance  higher proceeds from sales of used vehicles  the sale of our corporate headquarters complex and sale leaseback transactions 
net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow comparisons in the first half of were also positively impacted by the add back of depreciation expense of approximately million attributed to vies that were consolidated as a result of the adoption of fin on july  we anticipate negative free cash flow levels to improve in as a result of better operating performance and lower income tax payments 
capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment trucks  tractors  trailers primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within our fms business segment 
the level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth 
these contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows to us typically over a three to seven year term 
the commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers 
operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to fms and scs spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment  computer and telecommunications equipment  and warehouse facilities and equipment 
the following is a summary of capital expenditures years ended december in thousands revenue earning equipment full service lease commercial rental operating property and equipment total capital expenditures changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment capital expenditures exclude non cash additions of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions 
capital expenditures grew in and due primarily to increased replacement activity in our full service lease business 
vehicle capital spending levels were relatively low from to as we focused efforts on extending leases with existing customers  redeploying surplus assets and right sizing our fleet 
accordingly  capital spending levels should be relatively higher from to because of increased replacement activity 
as a result of our fleet age and anticipated higher levels of new sales and replacement activity  total capital expenditures are anticipated to increase to approximately billion in  including lease vehicle replacements of approximately billion and spending for anticipated incremental lease growth of approximately million 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional financing 
in both and  ryder completed an acquisition related to the fms segment 
in the fourth quarter of  ryder completed two acquisitions related to the fms segment 
total consideration paid for these acquisitions was million in  million in and million in approximately million is due to the sellers at december  and will be paid subject to holdback 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued provisions set forth in the purchase agreements 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
we will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in fms  scs and dcc in financing and other funding transactions we utilize external capital to support growth in our asset based product lines 
the variety of financing alternatives available to fund our capital needs include long term and medium term public and private debt  asset backed securities  bank term loans  leasing arrangements  bank credit facilities and commercial paper 
the following table shows the movements in our debt balance years ended december in thousands debt balance at january cash related changes in debt net change in commercial paper borrowings proceeds from issuance of medium term notes proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments retirement of debentures other debt repaid  including capital lease obligations non cash changes in debt fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging addition of capital lease obligations changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items total changes in debt debt balance at december in accordance with our funding philosophy  we attempt to match the average remaining repricing life of our debt with the average remaining life of our assets 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding 
the variable rate portion of our total obligations including notional value of swap agreements was at december   compared with at december  ryder s leverage ratios and a reconciliation of balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows december  to december  to equity equity dollars in thousands on balance sheet debt off balance sheet debt pv of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles total obligations present value pv does not reflect payments ryder would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates 
debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt for the period divided by total shareholders equity 
total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles  discounted based on our 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued incremental borrowing rate at lease inception  all divided by total shareholders equity 
although total obligations is a non gaap financial measure  we believe that total obligations is useful as it is a more complete measure of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess ryder s overall leverage position 
the increase in leverage ratios in was driven by our increased funding needs as a result of higher vehicle capital spending requirements  higher income tax payments and stock repurchases 
our long term target percentage of total obligations to equity is to while maintaining a strong investment grade rating 
we believe this leverage range is appropriate for our business due to the liquidity of our vehicle portfolio and because a substantial component of our assets are supported by long term customer leases 
our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings 
these ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable 
lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets 
a downgrade of ryder s debt rating below investment grade level would limit our ability to issue commercial paper 
as a result  we would have to rely on other established funding sources described below 
our debt ratings at december  were as follows short term long term outlook moody s investors service p baa stable june standard poor s ratings services a bbb stable april fitch ratings f a stable july ryder can borrow up to million through a global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the credit facility is used primarily to finance working capital internationally and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper 
the credit facility can also be used to issue up to million in letters of credit there were no facility supported letters of credit outstanding at december  
at ryder s option  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor  prime  federal funds or local equivalent rates 
during may  the terms of the credit facility were amended thereby extending the expiration of the facility one year to and reducing the current annual facility fee from basis points to basis points 
the annual facility fee applies to the total facility of million  and is based on ryder s current long term credit ratings 
the credit facility contains no provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to ryder s business operations  however  the credit facility does contain standard representations and warranties  events of default  cross default provisions  and certain affirmative and negative covenants 
in order to maintain availability of funding  ryder must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth  as defined in the agreement  of less than or equal to 
the ratio at december  was 
during  we issued million of unsecured medium term notes  of which million mature in april  million mature in april and million mature in june the proceeds from the notes were used for general corporate purposes 
during  we repaid million of debentures 
in september  ryder filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to issue up to million of securities  including million of available securities that were carried forward from the previous shelf registration statement 
the universal shelf registration statement became effective in november proceeds from debt issuances under the universal shelf registration statement are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  which may include capital expenditures  share repurchases and reduction in commercial paper borrowings 
at 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december   ryder had million of debt securities available for issuance under the latest registration statement 
in september  ryder receivable funding  ii  llc rrf llc  a bankruptcy remote  consolidated subsidiary of ryder system  inc  entered into a trade receivables purchase and sale agreement the trade receivables agreement with various financial institutions 
under this program  ryder sells certain of its domestic trade accounts receivable to rrf llc who in turn may sell  on a revolving basis  an ownership interest in certain of these accounts receivable to a receivables conduit and or committed purchasers 
under the terms of the program  rrf llc and ryder have provided representations  warranties  covenants and indemnities that are customary for accounts receivable facilities of this type 
ryder entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations  particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other funding programs  notably the issuance of unsecured commercial paper 
this program is similar to ryder s previous accounts receivable facility  which expired in december  except that this program will be a day facility 
this program will be accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement 
the available proceeds that may be received by rrf llc under the program are limited to million 
rrf llc s costs under this program may vary based on changes in ryder s unsecured debt ratings and changes in interest rates 
if no event occurs which would cause early termination  the program will expire on september   unless extended by the parties 
at december   no receivables were sold pursuant to the trade receivables agreement 
at december   ryder had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities in millions global revolving credit facility shelf registration statement trade receivables facility off balance sheet arrangements sale and leaseback transactions 
we periodically enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to lower the total cost of funding our operations  to diversify our funding among different classes of investors eg  regional banks  pension plans and insurance companies and to diversify our funding among different types of funding instruments 
these sale leaseback transactions are often executed with third party financial institutions that are not deemed to be vies 
in general  these sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet  as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt 
accordingly  sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense 
during  we completed two sale and operating leaseback transactions of revenue earning equipment with third party financial institutions not deemed to be vies and these transactions qualified for off balance sheet treatment 
proceeds from such sale leaseback transactions totaled million 
these leases contain limited guarantees by us of the residual values of the leased vehicles residual value guarantees that are conditioned upon disposal of the leased vehicles prior to the end of their lease term 
proceeds from other sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for off balance sheet treatment were million 
we did not enter into any sale and operating leaseback transactions during the years ended december  and guarantees 
ryder has executed various agreements with third parties that contain standard indemnifications that may require ryder to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a variety of matters such as lease obligations  financing agreements  environmental matters  and agreements to sell business assets 
in each of these instances  payment by ryder is contingent on the other party bringing about a claim under the procedures outlined in the specific agreement 
normally  these procedures allow 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued ryder to dispute the other party s claim 
additionally  ryder s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of the amount and or timing of any claim 
we cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under certain of these agreements due to the contingent nature of the potential obligations and the distinctive provisions that are involved in each individual agreement 
historically  no such payments made by ryder have had a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that if a loss were incurred in any of these matters  the loss would not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the total amount of maximum exposure determinable under these types of provisions at december  and was million and million  respectively  and we have accrued million as a corresponding liability 
see note  guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
contractual obligations and commitments as part of our ongoing operations  we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements  lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations 
the following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at december  thereafter total in thousands debt capital lease obligations total debt interest on debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations insurance obligations other long term liabilities  total total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year and bears interest principally at fixed rates 
interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at december  amounts are based on existing debt obligations  including capital leases  and do not consider potential refinancings of expiring debt obligations 
represents future lease payments associated with vehicles  equipment and properties under operating leases 
amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements 
no effect has been given to renewals  cancellations  contingent rentals or future rate changes 
the majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to information technology services 
purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
insurance obligations are primarily comprised of self insurance accruals 
represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams 
the most significant items included were derivative contracts  deferred compensation obligations and legal contractual obligations 
the amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions 
for  our pension contributions  including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by erisa and international regulatory bodies  are expected to be million 
our minimum funding requirements after are dependent on several factors 
however  we estimate that the present value of required contributions over the next years is approximately million pre tax for the us plan assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged 
we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit opeb plans 
these plans are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see further discussion in note  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued pension information in connection with the accrual of the additional minimum pension liability  we had an accumulated net pension equity charge after tax of million and million at december  and  respectively  which increased at december  as reductions in discount rates offset the appreciation in value of pension plan assets during the year 
total asset returns for our us qualified pension plan our primary plan were in the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates 
we review pension assumptions regularly and we may  from time to time  make voluntary contributions to our pension plans 
during  total pension contributions  including our international plans  were million compared with million in after considering the contributions  the projected present value of estimated contributions for our us plan that would be required over the next years totals approximately million pre tax 
changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans during could materially change  positively or negatively  the underfunded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in and beyond 
share repurchases and cash dividends in october  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program over a period not to exceed two years 
share repurchases of common stock are made periodically in open market transactions and are subject to market conditions  legal requirements and other factors 
at december   we had repurchased and retired approximately million shares under the october program at an aggregate cost of million 
management has established a prearranged written plan under rule b of the securities exchange act of as part of the october program  which allows for share repurchases during ryder s quarterly blackout periods as set forth in the trading plan 
we expect to complete the october program in the first quarter of in july  our board of directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
under the july program  shares of common stock were purchased in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued to employees upon the exercise of stock options or through employee stock purchase plans since may   which totaled approximately million shares at december  the july program limited aggregate share repurchases to no more than million shares of ryder common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  we replaced the july program with the october program noted previously 
in and  we repurchased and retired approximately million and million shares  respectively  under the july program at an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
management was granted the authority to establish a trading plan under rule b as part of the july program 
in  our board of directors authorized a two year share repurchase program intended to mitigate  in part  the dilutive impact of shares issued under our various employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
under the program  shares of common stock were purchased in a dollar amount not to exceed the proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock to employees since january  up to million 
during the second quarter of  we completed the program 
in and  we repurchased and retired approximately million and  shares  respectively  under the program at an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were million in  million in and million in during  we increased our annual dividend to per share of common stock 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued share of common stock 
the dividend reflects a increase from the per share of common stock quarterly cash dividend paid in market risk in the normal course of business  ryder is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices 
we manage these exposures in several ways  including  in certain circumstances  the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent 
we do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
our interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio 
from time to time  we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets 
see note  financial instruments and risk management  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at december  and at december   we had billion of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of and a fair value of billion  including the effects of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
at december   the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement totaled million 
at december   we had billion of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of and a fair value of billion  including the effects of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
we estimated the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt  including the effects of interest rate swaps  which effectively changed million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of to libor based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
at december   the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements totaled million 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt  including the effects of interest rate swaps  which effectively changed million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of to libor based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at december  totaled million 
a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would impact pre tax earnings by approximately million 
exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  brazilian real and mexican peso 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings of approximately million 
we also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
we generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries 
at december  and  we had a million cross currency swap used to hedge our net investment in a foreign subsidiary and for which we recognized a liability equal to its fair value of million and million  respectively 
at december   we also had forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate fair value of million 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million at both december  and  respectively 
we estimated the fair values of derivatives based on dealer quotations 
exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices 
at december   we had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages 
we are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased 
increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices 
however  profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs 
we believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact ryder s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental matters the operations of ryder involve storing and dispensing petroleum products  primarily diesel fuel  regulated under environmental protection laws 
these laws require us to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  we continually upgrade our operating facilities and implement various programs to detect and minimize contamination 
capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately million in  million in and million in we incurred environmental expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses such as licensing  testing and waste disposal fees 
based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations  environmental expenses and related capitalized costs should not increase materially from levels in the near term 
the ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors  primarily the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
based upon information presently available  we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters  although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year  will not have a material adverse effect on ryder s financial condition or liquidity 
see note  environmental matters  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different estimates that could have 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on ryder s financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods 
we periodically review the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with ryder s audit committee 
the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical 
depreciation and residual value guarantees 
we periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our fms business segment as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies revenue earning equipment  operating property and equipment and depreciation and summary of significant accounting policies residual value guarantees and deferred gains  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
reductions in residual values ie  the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment 
we review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment 
reviews are performed based on vehicle class  generally subcategories of trucks  tractors and trailers by weight and usage 
we consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles  expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles eg  rental fleet  and scs and dcc applications 
as a result  future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors 
at the end of  we completed our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment 
based on the results of our analysis  we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment on january   which will cause depreciation expense in to decrease by approximately million compared with based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at december   a decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in by approximately million 
ryder also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements 
certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment 
results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease 
the amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease 
at december   total liabilities for residual value guarantees of million were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities for those payable in less than one year and in other non current liabilities 
while we believe that the amounts are adequate  changes to management s estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles  the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process 
based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at december   a decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in by approximately million 
pension plans 
ryder sponsors several defined benefit plans covering most employees 
these plans generally provide participants with benefits based on years of service and career average compensation levels 
we apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis 
each december  we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions  if warranted 
in determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost  we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate  expected long term rate of return  expected increase in compensation levels  retirement rate and mortality 
discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our december annual measurement date 
in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan  we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary us plan to coupons and maturities 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds 
long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns 
investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions 
the composition of our pension assets was equity securities and debt securities and other investments 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon actual experience 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience  while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality 
accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in note  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have an unrecognized loss of million at the end of compared with a loss of million at the end of the increase in the net actuarial loss in results from actuarial losses associated with a reduction in discount rates and assets earning a rate of return below the assumed rates offset in part by the amortization of the opening balance 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceed of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants 
the amount of the unrecognized loss subject to amortization in will be million 
the effect on years beyond will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans 
disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the net pension expense is presented in note  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a sensitivity analysis of projected net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan  the us pension plan  is presented below 
effect on impact on net december  assumed rate change pension expense projected benefit obligation discount rate increase million million discount rate decrease million million expected long term rate of return on assets million rate of increase in compensation levels million self insurance accruals 
we use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  we consider such factors as frequency and severity of claims  claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments 
on an annual basis  third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of our self insurance accruals for reasonableness 
our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services  unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process 
while we believe that self insurance accruals are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates may not occur 
based on self insurance accruals at december   a adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in by approximately million 
goodwill impairment 
we assess goodwill for impairment  as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary 
to determine whether 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill impairment indicators exist  we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance 
our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model 
estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist 
these assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance  economic conditions and actions we expect to take 
in addition to these factors  our scs reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors 
the loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our scs reporting units  causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss 
for example  the profitability and valuation of fair value for our scs uk reporting unit is dependent in large part to a significant customer contract 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions  customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur  resulting in a goodwill impairment loss 
our annual impairment test  performed as of april   did not result in any impairment of goodwill 
at december   goodwill totaled million 
revenue recognition 
in the normal course of business  we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers 
the accounting issue encountered in these arrangements is whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties 
to the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis  any payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount is reflected in net earnings 
accordingly  the impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis 
determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement 
to the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction  revenue is reported on a gross basis 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction  revenue is reported on a net basis 
in the majority of our arrangements  we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis 
however  in certain instances typically when we manage transportation for our customers  we may be acting as an agent and report revenue on a net basis 
in transportation management contracts where we act as an agent  we have complete discretion in selecting the means  route and procedures to be followed in the handling  transportation and delivery of freight 
in addition  we may provide services related to freight bill audits and payments 
during  we entered into a significant scs managed subcontracted transportation contract that we determined  after a formal review of the terms and conditions of the services  that we were acting as principal in the arrangement 
as a result  we recognized an additional million in revenue and subcontracted transportation costs in by reporting revenue on a gross basis 
income taxes 
ryder s overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return  and some are timing differences  such as depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
we record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized 
at both december  and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the scs business segment was million 
in determining the required level of valuation allowance  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is based on management s expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods 
our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain  and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates 
should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made 
we are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the us and around the world 
tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to challenges from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due 
these challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions  or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings  we record the amount we expect to incur as a result of audits 
such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit 
actual results could vary materially from these estimates 
as discussed in note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in february we resolved all issues with the irs related to the and tax period  including interest and penalties 
in connection with the resolution of this audit  on february  we paid million after utilization of all available federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  including interest through the date of payment 
the amount we paid was consistent with our accrual at december  and was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
in  the irs began auditing our federal income tax returns for to we believe that ryder has not entered into any other transactions since that raise the same type of issues identified by the irs in its most recent audit

sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec announced that the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  as a result  we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of sfas no 
r would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share
