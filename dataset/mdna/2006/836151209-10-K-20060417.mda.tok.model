sales of cds and dvds are traditionally highest during our fourth quarter the holiday season  while returns are highest during our first quarter 
consequently  working capital needs for the home entertainment products marketplace are typically highest in our third quarter due to increases in inventories purchased for the holiday selling season and extension of credit terms to certain customers 
historically  the cd and dvd fulfillment segment has financed their working capital needs through cash generated from operations  extended terms from suppliers and bank borrowings

page of the wire manufacturing business is seasonal because most retailers prefer initiating new programs before the holiday shopping season begins  which concentrates revenues in the second and third quarter 
receivables from these fixture programs are generally collected from all participants within days 
we are usually required to tender payment on the costs of these programs raw material and labor within a shorter period 
as a result  our funding requirements peak in the second and third fiscal quarters when we manufacture the wire fixtures and decrease significantly in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as the related receivable are collected and significantly less manufacturing activity is occurring

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of page of contingent liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record a reduction in revenue for estimated cd  dvd  and magazine sales returns and a reduction in cost of sales for estimated purchase returns 
estimated sales returns are based on historical sales returns and daily point of sale data from significant customers 
the purchase return estimate is calculated from the sales return reserve based on historical gross profit 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future results  revenue and or cost of sales may be misstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on customer specific information and historical collection experience 
if market conditions decline  actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in increased bad debt expenses 
taxes on earnings the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expenses or benefits 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
the annual impairment review was completed in the first fiscal quarter of  and and no impairment charge was necessary 
fair value of the operating unit is determined based on a combination of discounted cash flows and publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples of comparable businesses 
for goodwill valuation purposes only  the fair value of the operating segment is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the operating segment to arrive at an implied fair value of goodwill  based upon known facts and circumstances as if the acquisition occurred currently 
the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss 
impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable page of is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 
our debt primarily relates to credit facilities with wells fargo foothill 
see debt in item management s discussion and analysis 
the revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million at january  interest on the outstanding balance is charged based on a variable interest rate related to the prime rate at january  plus a margin specified in the credit agreement based on an availability calculation at january  as a result of the above  our primary market risks relate to fluctuations in interest rates 
a increase in the prevailing weighted average interest rate on our debt at january   is estimated to cause an increase of million in interest expense for the year ending january  we do not perform any interest rate hedging activities related to these two facilities 
we have exposure to foreign currency fluctuation through our exporting of foreign magazines and the purchased of foreign magazine for domestic distribution 
page of revenues derived from the export of foreign titles or sales to domestic brokers who facilitate the export totaled million for the fiscal year ended january  or of total revenues 
for the most part  our export revenues are denominated in dollars  and the foreign wholesaler is subject to foreign currency risks 
we have the availability to control foreign currency risk via increasing or decreasing the local cover price paid in the foreign markets 
there is a risk that a substantial increase in local cover price  due to a decline in the local currency relative to the dollar  could decrease demand for these magazines at retail and negatively impact our results of operations 
domestic distribution gross of imported titles totaled approximately million of a total  million or 
foreign publications are purchased in both dollars and the local currency of the foreign publisher  primarily euros and pounds sterling 
in the instances where we buy in the foreign currency  we generally have the ability to set the domestic cover price  which allows us to minimize if we so choose the foreign currency risk 
foreign titles generally have significantly higher cover prices than comparable domestic titles  are sold only at select retail locations  and sales do not appear to be highly impacted by cover price increases 
however  a significant negative change in the relative strength of the dollar to these foreign currencies could result in higher domestic cover prices and result in lower sales of these titles at retail  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
we do not conduct any significant hedging activities related to foreign currency
