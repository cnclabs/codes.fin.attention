item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included in management s discussion and analysis are the following sections overview of acquisitions in critical accounting policies results of operations liquidity and capital resources commitments and off balance sheet arrangements other matters new accounting pronouncements in the discussions that follow  we will focus on two measures that we use to manage the business and to review the results of our operations 
those two measures are segment margin and available cash before reserves 
our profitability depends to a significant extent upon our ability to maximize segment margin 
segment margin is calculated as revenues less cost of sales and operating expense  and does not include depreciation and amortization 
segment margin also includes our equity in the operating income of joint ventures 
a reconciliation of segment margin to income from continuing operations is included in our segment disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
available cash before reserves is a non gaap liquidity measure calculated as net income with several adjustments  the most significant of which are the elimination of gains and losses on asset sales  except those from the sale of surplus assets  the addition of non cash expenses such as depreciation  the replacement with the amount recognized as our equity in the income of joint ventures with the available cash generated from those ventures  and the subtraction of maintenance capital expenditures  which are expenditures to sustain existing cash flows but not to provide new sources of revenues 
for additional information on available cash before reserves and a reconciliation of this measure to cash flows from operations  see liquidity and capital resources non gaap financial measure below 
overview of we conduct our business through three segments pipeline transportation primarily of crude oil  crude oil gathering and marketing  and industrial gases 
we have a diverse portfolio of customers and assets  including pipeline transportation of primarily crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas and carbon dioxide co in the gulf coast region of the united sates 
in conjunction with our crude oil pipeline transportation operations  we operate a crude oil gathering and marketing business  which among other things helps ensure a base supply of crude oil for our pipelines 
we participate in industrial gas activities  including a co supply business  which is associated with the co tertiary oil recovery process being used in mississippi by an affiliate of our general partner 
we generate revenues by selling crude oil and industrial gases and by charging fees for the transportation of crude oil  natural gas and co on our pipelines  and through our joint venture in t p syngas supply company  fees for services to produce syngas for our customer from the customer s raw materials 
our focus is on the margin we earn on these revenues  which is calculated by subtracting the costs of the crude oil  the costs of transporting the crude oil  natural gas and co to the customer  and the costs of operating our assets 
we also report our share of the earnings of our joint venture  t p syngas in which we acquired a interest on april  our objective is to operate as a growth oriented midstream mlp with a focus on increasing cash flow  earnings and return to our unitholders by becoming one of the leading providers of pipeline transportation  crude oil gathering and marketing and industrial gas services in the regions in which we operate 
increases in cash flow generally result in increases in available cash before reserves  which we distribute quarterly to our unitholders 
during  we generated million of available cash before reserves  and distributed million to our unitholders 
during  cash provided by operations was million 
in  we generated net income and earnings per limited partner of million and per unit 
the results for include increased segment margin from our pipeline transportation and significant contributions from asset acquisitions in the industrial gases segment 
we also disposed of idle assets 
fluctuations in our unit price decreased our general and administrative expenses as we recognized a credit related to our stock appreciation rights plan 
in december  we raised equity capital in connection with a public offering of newly issued limited partner units 
the public acquired  of units and our general partner acquired  units to maintain its proportionate ownership interest in us 
this offering of limited partner units provided us with net proceeds of million  with million being contributed by our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
the proceeds of this offering were used to temporarily reduce our outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility at december  we increased our cash distribution by to per unit for the third quarter of which was paid in november and increased our cash distribution again to per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution was paid in february this distribution represented a increase from our distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of acquisitions in acquisition of syngas joint venture on april   we acquired a interest in t p syngas supply company t p syngas for million 
we acquired our interest from tchi inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of chevrontexaco global energy inc praxair hydrogen supply  inc praxair owns the other interest in the partnership 
we financed our t p syngas interest acquisition with proceeds from our credit facility 
t p syngas is a partnership that owns a syngas manufacturing facility located in texas city  texas 
that facility processes natural gas to produce syngas a combination of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and high pressure steam 
praxair provides the raw materials to be processed and receives the syngas and steam produced by the facility under a long term processing agreement 
t p syngas receives a processing fee for its services 
praxair operates the facility 
t p syngas is managed by a management committee consisting of two representatives each from praxair and us 
the t p syngas management committee has an approved resolution that provides that cash distributions will be paid quarterly to the partners 
in  we received distributions totaling million and we received a distribution in february of million 
we expect our investment in t p syngas to provide another source of stable  long term cash flow and additional balance to our business 
acquisition of co assets on october   we acquired two long term co sales contracts with industrial customers  along with the bcf of co in the form of vpps necessary to satisfy substantially all of our expected obligations under those contracts  from denbury for million in cash 
we funded this acquisition with borrowings under our credit facility 
this acquisition further diversified our asset base and provides a stable  long term source of cash flow to us 
since  we have acquired seven long term co sales contracts  along with three vpps representing in the aggregate bcf of co from denbury for a total of million in cash 
in accordance with our procedures for evaluating and valuing material acquisitions with denbury  our special conflicts committee of our board of directors engaged independent financial and legal advisors and obtained a fairness opinion from the independent financial advisor regarding the acquisition of the third volumetric production payment 
the opinion we received stated the transaction was fair to our unitholders 
see certain relationships and related transactions for a description of our affiliate transaction procedures 
gas pipeline transportation assets in january  we acquired fourteen natural gas pipeline and gathering systems located in texas  louisiana and oklahoma from multifuels energy asset group  lp for million 
these fourteen systems are comprised of miles of pipeline and related assets 
this acquisition was financed with proceeds from our credit facility 
the results of this acquisition are included in our pipeline transportation segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial results and positions 
these policies require management s judgment and often employ the use of information that is inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue and expense accruals  pipeline loss allowance recognition  depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets and contingent and environmental liabilities 
we discuss these policies below 
revenue and expense accruals information needed to record our revenues is generally available to allow us to record substantially all of our revenue generating transactions based on actual information 
the accruals that we are required to make for revenues are generally insignificant 
we routinely make accruals for expenses due to the timing of receiving third party information and reconciling that information to our records 
these accruals can include some crude oil purchase costs and expenses for operating our assets such as contractor charges for goods and services provided 
for crude oil purchases transported on our trucks or our pipelines  we have access to the volumetric and pricing data so that we can record these transactions based on actual information 
accounting for crude oil purchases that involve third party transportation services sometimes require us to make estimates  as the necessary volumetric data is not available within the timeframe needed 
by balancing our crude oil purchase and sales volumes with the change in our inventory positions  we believe we can make reasonable estimates of the unavailable data 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  require that estimates be made of the effectiveness of derivatives as hedges and the fair value of derivatives 
the actual results of the transactions involving the derivative instruments will most likely differ from the estimates 
we make very limited use of derivative instruments  however  when we do  we base these estimates on information obtained from third parties and from our own internal records 
we believe our estimates for revenue and expense items are reasonable  but there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
pipeline loss allowance recognition numerous factors can cause crude oil volumes to expand and contract 
these factors include temperature of both the crude oil and the surrounding atmosphere and the quality of the crude oil  in addition to inherent imprecision of measurement equipment 
as a result of these factors  crude oil volumes fluctuate  which can result in losses in volumes of crude oil in the custody of the pipeline that belongs to the shippers 
in order to compensate the pipeline for bearing the risk of actual losses in volumes that occur  the pipeline generally has established in its tariffs the right to make volumetric deductions from the shippers for quality and volumetric fluctuations 
we refer to these deductions as pipeline loss allowances 
we compare these allowances to the actual volumetric gains and losses of the pipeline and the net gain or loss is recorded as revenue or expense  based on prevailing market prices at that time 
when net gains occur  the pipeline company has crude oil inventory 
when net losses occur  we reduce any recorded inventory on hand and record a liability for the purchase of crude oil that we must make to replace the lost volumes 
we reflect inventories in the financial statements at the lower of the recorded value or the market value at the balance sheet date 
we value liabilities to replace crude oil at current market prices 
the crude oil in inventory can then be sold  resulting in additional revenue if the sales price exceeds the inventory value 
we cannot predict future pipeline loss allowance revenue because these revenues depend on factors beyond management s control such as the crude oil quality and temperatures  as well as crude oil market prices 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets in order to calculate depreciation and amortization we must estimate the useful lives of our fixed assets at the time the assets are placed in service 
we base our calculation of the useful life of an asset on our experience with similar assets 
experience  however  can cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we review our assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the carrying value of the fixed asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from that asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include estimating future volumes  future margins or tariff rates  future operating costs and other estimates and assumptions consistent with our business plans 
should the undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying value  we record an impairment charge to reflect the asset at fair value 
asset retirement obligations some of our assets  primarily related to our pipeline operations segment  have obligations regarding removal and restoration activities when the asset is abandoned 
additionally  we generally have obligations to remove crude oil injection stations located on leased sites 
we estimate the fair values of these obligations based on current costs  inflation estimates and other factors in order to record the liabilities 
we also must estimate the ultimate timing of the performance of these liabilities in determining the fair value of the obligations 
we revise these estimates as information becomes available that affects the assumptions we made 
liability and contingency accruals we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including environmental remediation and potential legal claims 
when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  we make accruals 
we base our estimates on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome  including consultation with external experts and counsel 
we revise these estimates as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
we also make estimates related to future payments for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
environmental costs include costs for studies and testing as well as remediation and restoration 
we sometimes make these estimates with the assistance of third parties involved in monitoring the remediation effort 
we have recorded an estimate for the additional costs of million expected to be incurred to complete the remediation of the site of the mississippi crude oil pipeline spill 
we based this estimate upon expectations of the additional work to be performed to meet regulatory requirements and restore the site 
because the costs of remediation and restoration for this spill are expected to be covered by insurance  we recorded a receivable from the insurers for a similar amount 
we are currently conducting remediation of subsurface soil and groundwater hydrocarbon contamination at the former jay trucking facility 
the estimated remediation and related costs are million  which we expect to share with other responsible parties 
in  we recorded a liability of million as our estimated share of this liability 
we currently have no reason to believe that this remediation will have a material financial effect on our financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
we believe our estimates for contingent liabilities are reasonable  but we cannot assure you that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
results of operations pipeline transportation segment we operate three common carrier crude oil pipeline systems in a four state area 
we refer to these pipelines as our mississippi system  jay system and texas system 
volumes shipped on these systems for the last three years are as follows barrels per day pipeline system mississippi    jay    texas    the mississippi system begins in soso  mississippi and extends to liberty  mississippi 
at liberty  shippers can transfer the crude oil to a connection to capline  a pipeline system that moves crude oil from the gulf coast to refineries in the midwest 
the system has been improved to handle the increased volumes produced by denbury and transported on the pipeline 
in order to handle future increases in production volumes in the area that are expected  we have made capital expenditures for tank  station and pipeline improvements and we intend to make further improvements 
see capital expenditures under liquidity and capital resources below 
denbury is the largest producer based on average barrels produced per day of crude oil in the state of mississippi 
our mississippi system is adjacent to several of denbury s existing and prospective oil fields 
our mississippi system is adjacent to several of denbury s existing and prospective oil fields 
as denbury continues to acquire and develop old oil fields using co based tertiary recovery operations  denbury expects to add crude oil gathering and co supply infrastructure to these fields 
beginning in september  denbury became a shipper on the mississippi system  under an incentive tariff  designed to encourage shippers to increase volumes shipped on the pipeline 
prior to this point  denbury sold its production to us before it entered the pipeline 
in the fourth quarter of  we constructed two segments of crude oil pipeline to connect producing fields operated by denbury to our mississippi system 
one of these segments was placed in service in and the other began operations in the first quarter of denbury pays us a minimum payment each month for the right to use these pipeline segments 
we account for these arrangements as direct financing leases 
the jay pipeline system in florida alabama ships crude oil from fields with relatively short remaining production lives 
throughput has declined from an annual average of  barrels per day in  to  barrels per day in  and to  barrels per day in  although part of the decline in and can be attributed to hurricanes that passed near the panhandle of florida 
while our facilities experienced minimal damage from the storms  power outages in the area shut down our crude oil pipeline transportation operations for several days 
new production in the area surrounding the jay system has offset some of the declining production curves of the older producing fields in the area  however we do not know if this new production will be sufficient to continue to offset declining production from existing wells in the area 
one of the larger older fields has been unable to return to its production levels before the hurricanes of we do not know if they will be successful in returning to those levels 
should the production surrounding the jay system decline such that it becomes uneconomical to continue to operate the pipeline in crude oil service  we believe that the best use of the jay system may be to convert it to natural gas service 
we continue to review opportunities to effect such a conversion 
part of the process will involve finding alternative methods for us to continue to provide crude oil transportation services in the area 
while we believe this initiative has long term potential  it is not expected to have a substantial impact on us during or volumes on our texas system averaged  barrels per day during the crude oil that enters our system comes to us at west columbia where we have a connection to teppco s south texas system and at webster where we have connections to two other pipelines 
one of these connections at webster is with exxonmobil pipeline and is used to receive volumes that originate from teppco s pipelines 
under the terms of our sale of portions of the texas system to teppco  we had a joint tariff with teppco through october under which we earned per barrel on the majority of the barrels we deliver to the shipper s facilities 
this tariff declined to per barrel in november substantially all of the volume being shipped on our texas system goes to two refineries on the texas gulf coast 
our texas system is dependent on the connecting carriers for supply  and on the two refineries for demand for our services 
volumes on the texas system have declined since the sale to teppco as a result of changes in the supply available for the two refineries to acquire and ship on our pipeline and changes teppco made to the operations of the pipeline segments it acquired from us 
we lease tankage in webster on the texas system of approximately  barrels 
we have a tank rental reimbursement agreement effective january  with the primary shipper on our texas system to reimburse us for the expense of leasing of that storage capacity 
volumes on the texas system may continue to fluctuate as refiners on the texas gulf coast compete for crude oil with other markets connected to teppco s pipeline systems 
we operate a co pipeline in mississippi to transport co from denbury s main co pipeline to brookhaven oil field 
denbury has the exclusive right to use this co pipeline 
this arrangement has been accounted for as a direct financing lease 
historically  the largest operating costs in our crude oil pipeline segment have consisted of personnel costs  power costs  maintenance costs and costs of compliance with regulations 
some of these costs are not predictable  such as failures of equipment  or are not within our control  like power cost increases 
we perform regular maintenance on our assets to keep them in good operational condition and to minimize cost increases 
operating results from continuing operations for our pipeline transportation segment were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands crude oil tariffs and revenues from direct financing leases of crude oil pipelines    sales of crude oil pipeline loss allowance volumes    revenues from direct financing leases of co pipelines tank rental reimbursements and other miscellaneous revenues total revenues from crude oil and co tariffs  including revenues from direct financing leases    revenues from natural gas tariffs and sales  natural gas purchases  pipeline operating costs    segment margin    volumes per day from continuing operations crude oil pipeline barrels    year ended december  compared with year ended december  pipeline segment margin increased million  or  for  as compared to revenues from crude oil and co tariffs and related sources added million of the increase for the period and million of the increase resulted from net profit from natural gas transportation and sales 
pipeline operating cost increases offset million of the revenue increases 
crude oil and co tariff revenues increased million in compared to the prior year period due to the combination of higher tariffs and higher volumes on the systems with higher per barrel tariffs 
volumes on our pipelines were affected briefly by hurricanes in both periods 
the effects of lower tariffs and volumes on the texas system were generally offset by increased volumes and tariffs on the mississippi system 
higher market prices for crude oil added million to pipeline loss allowance revenues 
the co pipeline did not exist until december  and the natural gas gathering pipelines were acquired in the first quarter of operating costs increased million 
in  as well as in  we incurred costs for regulatory testing and repairs resulting from that testing 
those costs were approximately million greater in operational costs for personnel  contract services  liability insurance and equipment maintenance accounted for most of the remaining increase 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  in  pipeline segment margin increased million  or  as compared to a decrease in operating costs was a large part of this improvement 
total revenues from crude oil and co tariffs and related sources also increased  contributing million of the total increase 
crude oil and co tariff revenues increased million  with higher tariff rates offsetting decreases in volumes 
pipeline loss allowance revenues benefited from higher market sales prices for crude oil 
operating costs declined million from the level 
in  we recorded a charge of million for an accrual for the removal of an abandoned offshore pipeline 
in  we received permission to abandon the pipeline in place 
as a result we reversed million of the amounts previously accrued 
the charges and reversal resulted in a change of million in pipeline operating costs between the periods 
additionally  repairs  right of way maintenance and regulatory testing and compliance expenses in the period were million less than in changes in other operating costs resulted in another million of decreased costs 
industrial gases segment our industrial gases segment includes the results of our co sales to industrial customers and our share of the operating income of our partnership interest in t p syngas 
co we supply co to industrial customers under seven long term co sales contracts 
we acquired those contracts  as well as the co necessary to satisfy substantially all of our expected obligations under those contracts  in three separate transactions with denbury 
since  we have purchased those contracts  along with three vpps representing bcf of co in the aggregate  from denbury for a total of million in cash 
we sell our co to customers who treat the co and sell it to end users for use for beverage carbonation and food chilling and freezing 
our compensation for supplying co to our industrial customers is the effective difference between the price at which we sell our co under each contract and the price at which we acquired our co pursuant to our vpps  minus transportation costs 
we expect our co contracts to provide stable cash flows until they expire  at which time we will attempt to extend or replace those contracts  including acquiring the necessary co supply from wholesalers 
at december   we have bcf of co remaining under the vpps 
the terms of our contracts with the industrial co customers include minimum take or pay and maximum delivery volumes 
the maximum daily contract quantity per year in the contracts totals  mcf 
under the minimum take or pay volumes  the customers must purchase a total of  mcf per day whether received or not 
any volume purchased under the take or pay provision in any year can then be recovered in a future year as long as the minimum requirement is met in that year 
in the three years ended december   all of our customers purchased more than their minimum take or pay quantities 
our seven industrial contracts expire at various dates beginning in and extending through the sales contracts contain provisions for adjustments for inflation to sales prices based on the producer price index  with a minimum price 
the industrial customers treat the co and transport it to their own customers 
the primary industrial applications of co by these customers include beverage carbonation and food chilling and freezing 
based on historical data for through  we can expect some seasonality in our sales of co 
the dominant months for beverage carbonation and freezing food are from april to october  when warm weather increases demand for beverages and the approaching holidays increase demand for frozen foods 
the table below depicts these seasonal fluctuations 
the average daily sales in mcfs of co for each quarter in and under these contracts including volumes sold by denbury on the contracts we acquired in the third quarter of and fourth quarter of were as follows quarter first   second   third   fourth   syngas on april   we acquired from tchi inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of chevrontexaco global energy inc  a partnership interest in t p syngas for million in cash  which we funded with proceeds from our credit facility 
t p syngas is a partnership which owns a facility located in texas city  texas that manufactures syngas and high pressure steam 
under that processing agreement  praxair provides the raw materials to be processed and receives the syngas and steam produced by the facility 
t p syngas receives a processing fee for its services 
praxair has the exclusive right to use the facility through at least term extendable at praxair s option for two additional five year terms 
praxair also is our partner in the joint venture and owns the remaining interest 
we recognize our share of the earnings of t p syngas in each period 
we are amortizing the excess of the price we paid for our interest in t p syngas over our share of the equity of t p syngas over the remaining useful life of the assets of t p syngas 
this excess of million is being amortized over eleven years 
we receive cash distributions from t p syngas quarterly 
operating results operating results for our industrial gases segment were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands revenues from co sales    co transportation and other costs 
  equity in earnings of t p syngas segment margin   volumes per day co sales mcf    the increasing margins from the industrial gases segment between and and from to are primarily attributable to the acquisitions we have made each year in this segment 
the average revenue per mcf sold increased almost in each year  due to inflation adjustments in the contracts and variations in the volumes sold under each contract 
transportation costs for the co on denbury s pipeline have increased due to the increased volume and the effect of the annual inflation factor in the rate paid to denbury 
the rate per mcf in increased over the rate 
the rate in increased over the rate 
our share of the operating income of t p syngas for the nine month period we owned it in was  we reduced the amount we recorded as our equity in t p syngas by  as amortization of the excess purchase price of t p syngas 
during  t p syngas paid us distributions totaling million  and we received a distribution of million in attributable to the fourth quarter of crude oil gathering and marketing operations we conduct certain crude oil aggregating operations  which involve purchasing  gathering  transporting by trucks and pipelines owned by us and trucks  pipelines and barges operated by others  and reselling  that among other things help ensure a base supply source for our crude oil pipeline systems 
our profit for those services is derived from the difference between the price at which we re sell crude oil less the price at which we purchase that crude oil  minus the associated costs of aggregation and any cost of supplying credit 
the most substantial component of our aggregating costs relates to operation our fleet of leased trucks 
our crude oil gathering and marketing activities provide us with an extensive expertise  knowledge base and skill set that facilitates our ability to capitalize on regional opportunities which arise from time to time in our market areas 
usually this segment experiences limited commodity price risk because we generally make back to back purchases and sales  matching our sale and purchase volumes on a monthly basis 
the commodity price for purchases and sales of crude oil do not necessarily bear a relationship to segment margin as those prices normally impact revenues and costs of sales by approximately equivalent amounts 
because period to period variations in revenues and costs of sales are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in segment margin for our gathering and marketing operations  these changes are not addressed in the following discussion 
generally  as we purchase crude oil  we simultaneously establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
we do not hold crude oil  futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes 
most of our contracts for the purchase and sale of crude oil have components in the pricing provisions such that the price paid or received is adjusted for changes in the market price for crude oil 
the pricing in the majority of our purchase contracts contain the market price component  a bonus that is not fixed  but instead is based on another market factor and a deduction to cover the cost of transporting the crude oil and to provide us with a margin contracts will sometimes also contain a grade differential which considers the chemical composition of the crude oil and its appeal to different customers 
typically the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price components and the grade differentials 
the margin on individual transactions is then dependent on our ability to manage our transportation costs and to capitalize on grade differentials 
field operating costs consist of the costs to operate our fleet of leased trucks used to transport crude oil  and the costs to maintain the trucks and assets used in the crude oil gathering operation 
approximately of these costs are variable and increase or decrease with volumetric changes 
these costs include payroll and benefits as drivers are paid on a commission basis based on volumes  maintenance costs for the trucks as we lease the trucks under full service maintenance contracts under which we pay a maintenance fee per mile driven  and fuel costs 
fuel costs also fluctuate based on changes in the market price of diesel fuel 
fixed costs include the base lease payment for the vehicle  insurance costs and costs for environmental and safety related operations 
operating results from continuing operations for our crude oil gathering and marketing segment were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands revenues    crude oil costs    field operating costs    segment margin    volumes per day from continuing operations crude oil wellhead barrels    crude oil total barrels includes wellhead barrels    crude oil truck transported only barrels   year ended december  as compared to year ended december  crude oil gathering and marketing segment margins from continuing operations decreased million in from the prior year period 
an increase in field costs of million was offset by million of increased segment margin from four other factors 
the majority of the increase in field costs over related to higher fuel costs  higher employee costs and the costs related to additional tractor trailers we leased beginning in the third quarter of we also recorded a reserve of million for of the expected costs to remediate jay trucking station 
see additional discussion at note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the higher field costs were increases in four factors 
these factors were a million increase in revenues from volumes that we transported for a fee but did not purchase 
approximately of the total transportation fee revenue related to volumes transported for denbury 
through august   we purchased denbury s crude oil at the wellhead 
beginning in september  denbury started selling its production to the end market directly  and we provide transportation services for fees in our trucks and in our pipeline 
an increase in the average difference between the sales price and the purchase price of crude oil increased segment margin by million  despite a  barrel per day decrease in purchased volumes 
a million realized gain from a fair value hedge of inventory 
due to market conditions in the second quarter  we elected to hold inventory and hedge it in the market 
we sold this inventory in the fourth quarter realizing the gain 
a million decrease in credit costs related to crude oil transactions 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  gathering and marketing segment margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  contributing to this reduction in segment margin were two primary factors as follows a million decrease in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale 
the decrease on the margin between the sales and purchase prices of the crude oil is attributable primarily to increases in market factors and grade differentials in the first half of that we benefited from significantly 
a million increase in field operating costs  from increased fuel costs to operate our tractor trailers  additional employee compensation and benefit costs due to additional volumes  and higher insurance costs and higher vehicle maintenance costs 
although we reduced operations in from levels with the sale of a large part of our texas operations  our insurance  safety and other fixed costs did not decline proportionately 
partially offsetting these decreases was a increase in daily wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a million increase in segment margin 
additionally credit costs declined by million as we reduced the number of letters of credit we issued 
other costs and interest general and administrative expenses were as follows 
years ended december  in thousands expenses excluding effect of stock appreciation rights plan and bonus plan    bonus plan expense  stock appreciation rights plan credit expense  total general and administrative expenses    year ended december  compared with year ended december  general and administrative expenses  excluding the effects of our bonus plan and stock appreciation rights sar plan  decreased million in from the level 
in  we incurred expenses of million for professional services to assist us in the internal control documentation and assessment provisions of the sarbanes oxley act including additional audit fees related to this process 
in we formed an internal audit department to assist in the testing and evaluation of our internal controls 
the total costs related to internal control documentation  testing and assessment declined million between the two periods 
other administrative costs decreased million 
the bonus plan for employees is described in item  executive compensation below 
the plan provides for a bonus pool based on the amount of available cash generated 
in  we generated more available cash than in  resulting in a larger bonus expense 
the sar plan for employees and directors is a long term incentive plan whereby rights are granted for the grantee to receive cash equal to the difference between the grant price and common unit price at date of exercise 
the rights vest over several years 
our unit price was at december  at december   the unit price was  resulting in a non cash credit of million for see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  general and administrative expenses  excluding the effects of our stock appreciation rights sar plan  increased million in from the level 
the costs related to compliance with the internal control documentation and assessment provisions of the sarbanes oxley act contributed to this increase 
legal fees were million less in the period  primarily due to a charge that we took in the period for unamortized legal and consultant costs related to a credit facility that was replaced 
other administrative costs increased million 
our unit price rose from at december  to at december  resulting in a million non cash increase to the sar plan accrual in depreciation  amortization and impairment expense decreased million between and included a charge of million to write down the value of the segment of our mississippi system from baton rouge to its estimated salvage value 
although amortization related to the co assets increased in  this increase was offset by the cessation of depreciation on assets that were fully depreciated during and depreciation  amortization and impairment increased by million in from the level of million  due to two main factors 
the first is the write down related to the mississippi system segment 
we also had a full year of amortization of the co contracts in acquired late in interest expense  net was as follows years ended december  in thousands interest expense  including commitment fees  capitalized interest amortization and write off of facility fees interest income net interest expense  in  our net interest expense increased by million 
variances in debt outstanding primarily due to the acquisition of assets throughout  increases in market interest rates and an increase on june  to the size of our credit facility to million resulted in greater interest expense and commitment fees 
in  our net interest expense decreased by million 
interest expense and commitment fees increased for reasons similar to the period 
this increase was offset by a reduction in facility fees amortization and write off 
in  we wrote off the unamortized facility fees related to a credit facility that was replaced in march at december   we had no outstanding debt 
during  we will continue to amortize facility fees and will pay commitment fees on the unutilized portion of our credit facility

net gain loss on disposal of surplus assets 
in  and we sold surplus assets no longer in use in our operations  recognizing gains in and of million and million  respectively and a loss in of  discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  we sold a significant portion of our texas pipeline system and the related crude oil gathering and marketing operations to teppco crude oil  lp additionally we sold other segments of our texas pipeline system that had been idled in to blackhawk pipeline  lp  an affiliate of multifuels  inc we abandoned in place other remaining segments not sold to these parties in we received net proceeds from the transaction with teppco of million 
we agreed not to compete with teppco in a county area in texas surrounding the pipeline for a five year period 
we retained responsibility for environmental matters related to the operations sold to teppco for the period prior to the sale date  subject to certain conditions 
our responsibility to indemnify teppco for environmental matters in connection with this transaction will cease in ten years 
we do not expect the effects of this indemnification to have a material effect on our results of operations in the future 
operating results from the discontinued operations for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands gathering and marketing and pipeline revenues  costs and expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization  total costs and expenses  operating loss income from discontinued operations gain on disposal of assets  income loss from operations from discontinued texas system before minority interests  during  we sold assets that had been idled as a result of the sale to teppco  receiving million and recognizing a gain of million

cumulative effect adjustment on december   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarified that the term conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within our control 
although uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement may exist and may be conditional upon a future event  the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional 
accordingly  we are required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
some of our assets  primarily related to our pipeline operations segment  have obligations regarding removal activities when the asset is abandoned 
additionally  we generally have obligations to remove crude oil injection stations located on leased sites 
these assets are actively in use in our operations and the timing of the abandonment of these assets cannot be determined 
accordingly  under the provisions of fin  we have made an estimate of the fair value of our obligations 
upon adoption of fin  we recorded a fixed asset and a liability for the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligations at the time we acquired the related assets 
this million fixed asset is being depreciated over the life of the related assets 
the accretion of the discount on the liability and the depreciation through december  were recorded in the statement of operations as a cumulative effect adjustment totaling million 
additionally  we reflected our share of the asset retirement obligation recorded in accordance with fin of our equity method joint venture as a cumulative affect adjustment of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact for the periods ended december   and of the adoption of fin if it had been adopted at the beginning of each of those periods 
liquidity and capital resources capital resources we have a million credit facility comprised of a million revolving line of credit for acquisitions and a million working capital revolving facility 
the working capital portion of the credit facility is composed of two components up to million for loans and up to million for letters of credit 
in total we may borrow up to million in loans under our credit facility 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under the working capital portion 
we had no debt outstanding under the working capital or acquisition portions of our credit facility  as we paid off the balances with the proceeds of our limited partner unit offering completed in december due to the revolving nature of loans under our credit facility  additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re borrowings may be made until the maturity date of june  interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is equal to x either the applicable eurodollar settlement rate or the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or bank of america s prime rate for the relevant period  at our option  plus y the applicable margin rate 
we are required to pay our credit facility lenders a fee based upon amounts available but not borrowed under each of the acquisition and working capital facilities  as well as certain other fees 
the aggregate amount that we may have outstanding at any time in loans and letters of credit under the working capital portion of our credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation 
the borrowing base is limited to million and is calculated monthly 
at december   the borrowing base was million 
the total amount available for borrowings at december  was million under the working capital portion and million under the acquisition portion of our credit facility 
we must comply with various affirmative and negative covenants contained in our credit facility 
among other things  those covenants limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens  make payments in respect of or redeem or acquire any debt or equity issued by us  sell assets  make loans or investments  extend credit  acquire or be acquired by other companies  enter into or amend certain existing agreements to the detriment of the lenders under the credit facility  and to maintain physical petroleum inventory for which there is not an off setting sale or hedging agreement  subject to specified exceptions 
our credit facility covenants also require us to achieve specified minimum financial metrics 
for example  before we may make distributions to our partners  we must maintain a cash flow coverage ratio of at least to in general  this calculation compares operating cash inflows  as adjusted in accordance with the credit facility  less maintenance capital expenditures  to the sum of interest expense and distributions 
at december   the calculation resulted in a ratio of to the credit facility also requires that the level of operating cash inflows during the prior twelve months  as adjusted in accordance with the credit facility  be at least million 
at december   the result of this calculation was million 
our credit facility also requires that we meet or exceed certain other financial ratios  such as a current ratio  leverage ratio and funded indebtedness to capitalization ratio 
if we meet these covenants and are not otherwise in default under our credit facility  we are otherwise not limited by our credit facility in making distributions to our partners 
the covenants described above could prevent us from engaging in certain transactions which might otherwise be considered beneficial to us 
for example  they could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to make distributions to unitholders  to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general partnership requirements  to engage in future acquisitions  construction or development activities  or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness or to comply with any restrictive terms of our indebtedness  and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate 
our credit facility contains customary events of default  including for non payment of principal and interest  failure to comply with any covenant and failure to pay certain other of our indebtedness 
our average daily outstanding balance under our credit facility during was million 
the average interest rate we paid during this same period was 
our credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our assets 
capital expenditures a summary of our capital expenditures in the three years ended december    and is as follows year ended december  in thousands maintenance capital expenditures mississippi pipeline system   jay pipeline system texas pipeline system  crude oil gathering assets administrative assets total maintenance capital expenditures   growth capital expenditures including construction in progress mississippi pipeline system   natural gas gathering assets  t p syngas investment  co contracts    crude oil gathering assets total growth capital expenditures    total capital expenditures    we have no commitments to make capital expenditures  however  we anticipate that our maintenance capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
these expenditures are expected to relate primarily to the replacement of a tank on the texas system and improvements on our mississippi system 
based on the information available to us at this time  we do not anticipate that future capital expenditures for compliance with regulatory requirements will be material 
expenditures for capital assets to grow the partnership distribution will depend on our access to debt and capital discussed below in sources of future capital 
we will look for opportunities to acquire assets from other parties that meet our criteria for stable cash flows such as the three acquisitions discussed in acquisitions in above 
sources of future capital our credit facility provides us with million of capacity for acquisitions and million for borrowings under the working capital portion 
both portions of the facility are revolving facilities 
at december   we had no debt outstanding under either facility 
we expect to use cash flows from operating activities to fund cash distributions and maintenance capital expenditures needed to sustain existing operations 
future acquisitions or capital projects for our expansion will require funding through borrowings under our credit facility or from proceeds from equity offerings  or a combination of the two sources of funds 
cash flows our primary sources of cash flows have been operations  credit facilities  the issuance of equity  and in  proceeds from the sale of a portion of our operations 
our primary uses of cash flows are capital expenditures and distributions 
a summary of our cash flows is as follows year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities

our operating cash flows are affected significantly by changes in items of working capital 
we have had situations where other parties have prepaid for purchases or paid more than was due  resulting in fluctuations in one period as compared to the next until the party recovers the excess payment 
additionally  in  we paid the million in fines assessed in connection with the mississippi oil release in  which utilized our cash flows 
the accrual for this payment was made in and the timing of capital expenditures and the related effect on our recorded liabilities also affects operating cash flows

offsetting these expenditures was the receipt of million for the sale of idle assets 
we also received returns of our investment in t p syngas in the form of distributions totaling million 
cash flows used in investing activities in were million as compared to million in capital expenditures for construction of pipeline assets and the acquisition of a second volumetric payment from denbury were the primary uses of cash for investing

distributions we are required by our partnership agreement to distribute of our available cash as defined therein within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to our general partner 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts less cash disbursements adjusted for net changes to reserves 
we increased our distribution for the fourth quarter of and then again for the third and fourth quarters of as shown in the table below 
date per unit total distribution for paid amount amount s fourth quarter february first quarter may second quarter august third quarter november fourth quarter february  first quarter may  second quarter august  third quarter november  fourth quarter february  our general partner is entitled to receive incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  our general partner is entitled to receive of any distributions in excess of per unit  of any distributions in excess of per unit  and of any distributions in excess of per unit  without duplication 
the likelihood and timing of the payment of any incentive distributions will depend on our ability to increase the cash flow from our existing operations and to make cash flow accretive acquisitions 
in addition  our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue additional equity interests in our partnership with such rights  powers and preferences which may be senior to our common units as our general partner may determine in its sole discretion  including with respect to the right to share in distributions and profits and losses of the partnership 
we have not paid any incentive distributions and do not expect to make incentive distributions during available cash before reserves for the year ended december  is as follows in thousands net income  depreciation and amortization  cash received from direct financing leases not included in income cash effects from sales of certain asset sales effects of available cash generated by investment in t p syngas not included in net income non cash charges maintenance capital expenditures  available cash before reserves  we have reconciled available cash a non gaap liquidity measure to cash flow from operating activities the gaap measure for the year ended december  below 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities were million 
non gaap financial measure this annual report includes the financial measures of available cash  which measures often are referred to as non gaap measures because they are not contemplated by or referenced in accounting principles generally accepted in the us  also referred to as gaap 
the accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of those non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial 
our non gaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures such as net income  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other gaap measure of liquidity or financial performance 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management  lenders  analysts and other market participants 
available cash  also referred to as discretionary cash flow  is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and rating agencies  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structures or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest cost and support our indebtedness  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry  without regard to financing and capital structure  and the viability of projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
because available cash excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income or loss and because these measures may vary among other companies  the available cash data presented in this annual report on form k may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to available cash is net cash provided by operating activities 
available cash is a liquidity measure used by our management to compare cash flows generated by us to the cash distribution paid to our limited partners and general partner 
this is an important financial measure to our public unitholders since it is an indicator of our ability to provide a cash return on their investment 
specifically  this financial measure aids investors in determining whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can support a quarterly cash distribution to the partners 
lastly  available cash before reserves also referred to as distributable cash flow is the quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
the reconciliation of available cash a non gaap liquidity measure to cash flow from operating activities the gaap measure for the year ended december   is as follows in thousands year ended december  cash flows from operating activities  adjustments to reconcile operating cash flows to available cash maintenance capital expenditures  proceeds from sales of certain assets  amortization of credit facility issuance fees effects of available cash generated by investment in t p syngas not included in cash flows from operating activities cash effects of exercises under sar plan net effect of changes in operating accounts not included in calculation of available cash  available cash before reserves  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligation and commercial commitments in addition to our credit facility discussed above  we have contractual obligations under operating leases as well as commitments to purchase crude oil

for purposes of this table  market prices at december   were used to value the obligations 
actual obligations may differ from the amounts included above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  or financing partnerships  other than as disclosed under contractual obligation and commercial commitments above  nor do we have any debt or equity triggers based upon our unit or commodity prices 
other matters crude oil contamination litigation we were named one of the defendants in a petition filed on january   in the th district court of harris county  texas  cause no 
pennzoil quaker state company pqs was seeking property damages  loss of use and business interruption suffered as a result of a fire and explosion that occurred at the pennzoil quaker state refinery in shreveport  louisiana  on january  pqs claimed the fire and explosion were caused  in part  by genesis selling to pqs crude oil that was contaminated with organic chlorides 
in december  our insurers settled this litigation for million 
the settlement of this litigation had no effect on our results of operations 
pqs is also a defendant in five consolidated class action mass tort actions brought by neighbors living in the vicinity of the pqs shreveport  louisiana refinery in the first judicial district court  caddo parish  louisiana  cause nos 
 a 
 b   a   a  and  c 
pqs has brought third party claims against genesis and others for indemnity with respect to the fire and explosion of january  we believe that the claims against genesis are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 
environmental in  howell crude oil company entered into a sublease with koch industries  inc  covering a one acre tract of land located in santa rosa county  florida to operate a crude oil trucking station  known as jay station 
the sublease provided that howell would indemnify koch for environmental contamination on the property under certain circumstances 
howell operated the jay station from until december of when this operation was sold to us by howell 
we operated the jay station as a crude oil trucking station until koch has indicated that it has incurred certain investigative and or other costs  for which koch alleges some or all should be reimbursed by us  under the indemnification provisions of the sublease for environmental contamination on the site and surrounding areas 
koch has also alleged that we are responsible for future environmental obligations relating to the jay station 
howell was acquired by anadarko petroleum corporation anadarko in during the second quarter of  we entered into a joint defense and cost allocation agreement with anadarko 
under the terms of the joint allocation agreement  we agreed to reasonably cooperate with each other to address any liabilities or defense costs with respect to the jay station 
additionally under the joint allocation agreement  anadarko will be responsible for sixty percent of the costs related to any liabilities or defense costs incurred with respect to contamination at the jay station 
we were formed in by the sale and contribution of assets from howell and basis petroleum  inc anadarko s liability with respect to the jay station is derived largely from contractual obligations entered into upon our formation 
we believe that basis has contractual obligations under the same formation agreements 
we intend to seek recovery for basis share of potential liabilities and defense costs with respect to the jay station 
we have contacted the appropriate state regulatory agencies regarding developing a plan of remediation for certain affected soils at the jay station 
it is possible that we will also need to develop a plan for other affected soils and or affected groundwater 
we have accrued an estimate of our share of future liability for this matter in the amount of million 
the time period over which our liability would be paid is uncertain and could be several years 
this liability may decrease if indemnification and or cost reimbursement is obtained by us for basis potential liabilities with respect to this matter 
at this time  our estimate of potential obligations does not assume any specific amount contributed on behalf of the basis obligations  although we believe that basis is responsible for a significant part of these potential obligations 
insurance we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable 
the policies do not cover every potential risk associated with operating our assets  including the potential for a loss of significant revenues 
consistent with the coverage available in the industry  our policies provide limited pollution coverage  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental pollution events 
additionally  as a result of the events of september   the cost of insurance available to the industry has risen significantly  and insurers have excluded or reduced coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism and sabotage 
since september   warnings have been issued by various agencies of the united states government to advise owners and operators of energy assets that those assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations 
any future terrorist attacks on our assets  or assets of our customers or competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others as a result of our operations 
however  we cannot assure you that an event not fully insured or indemnified against will not materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
new and proposed accounting pronouncements eitf no 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached consensus in the issue of accounting for buy sell arrangements as part of its eitf issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty issue 
as part of issue  the eitf is requiring that all buy sell arrangements be reflected on a net basis  such that the purchase and sale are netted and shown as either a net purchase or a net sale in the income statement 
this requirement is effective for new arrangements entered into after march  if this requirement had been effective for the three years ended december   and  our reported crude oil gathering and marketing revenues from unrelated parties and our reported crude oil costs from unrelated parties would be reduced by the amounts shown in parenthetical notations on the consolidated statements of operations 
we do not expect that the adoption of issue will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised december  share based payment 
this statement replaces sfas no 
and requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement is effective for us in the first quarter of the adoption of this statement will require that the compensation cost associated with our stock appreciation rights plans be re measured each reporting period based on the fair value of the rights 
before the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for the stock appreciation rights in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans which required that the liability under the plan be measured at each balance sheet date based on the market price of our common units on that date 
under sfas r  the liability will be calculated using a fair value method that will take into consideration the expected future value of the rights at their expected exercise dates 
at december   we had a recorded liability of million  computed under the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
two significant factors in determining the fair value of this liability under fas r are the expected volatility of the market price for our common units  which we expect to increase the recorded liability  and the expected rate of employee forfeitures of rights granted due to termination of employment  which is expected to decrease the liability 
another factor impacting the fair value is the expected life of the rights  which is the period of time we would expect between the date when the rights vest and when the employee exercises the rights 
we have not completed the calculation of the impact of the adoption of fas r on our financial position or results of operations and such impact cannot be estimated  however we do not expect it to have any effect on our cash flows 
sfas in may  the fasb issued statement of financial standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
this statement establishes new standards on the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principles and error corrections 
sfas requires retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods for all such changes  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas is effective for us in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily related to volatility in crude oil prices and interest rates 
our primary price risk relates to the effect of crude oil price fluctuations on our inventories and the fluctuations each month in grade and location differentials and their effect on future contractual commitments 
we utilize nymex commodity based futures contracts and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to these market price fluctuations as needed 
at december   we had entered into forward contracts and nymex future contracts that will settle during february these contracts either do not qualify for hedge accounting or are fair value hedges  therefore the fair value of these derivatives have received mark to market treatment in current earnings 
this accounting treatment is discussed further under note to our consolidated financial statements 
sell short buy long contracts contracts futures contracts contract volumes  bbls weighted average price per bbl contract value in thousands  mark to market change in thousands market settlement value in thousands  forward contracts contract volumes  bbls weighted average price per bbl contract value in thousands   mark to market change in thousands market settlement value in thousands   the table above presents notional amounts in barrels  the weighted average contract price  total contract amount and total fair value amount in us dollars 
fair values were determined by using the notional amount in barrels multiplied by the december  quoted market prices on the nymex 
we are also exposed to market risks due to the floating interest rates on our credit facility 
our debt bears interest at the libor or prime rate plus the applicable margin 
we do not hedge our interest rates 
at december   we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility
