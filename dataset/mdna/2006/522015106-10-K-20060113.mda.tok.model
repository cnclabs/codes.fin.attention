volatility of stock price over learning tree s year history  the price of its common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
learning tree believes that some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of its stock have included announcements of developments related to learning tree s business  announcements concerning new products or enhancements by learning tree or its competitors  developments in relationships with its customers  market perceptions of new means of delivering training  such as cd roms or the internet  variations in revenues  gross margins  earnings or other financial results from investors expectations  fluctuations in results of operations and general conditions in the economy  the market  and the markets served by learning tree s customers  and delays in introducing new technologies by both learning tree s customers and technology vendors 
in addition  prices in the stock market  particularly for technology related stocks  have been volatile in recent years 
sales of the common stock by officers  directors and employees  especially learning tree s founders  could also adversely and unpredictably affect the price of the common stock 
additionally  the price could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to learning tree s performance

overview nature of the business 
learning tree is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training to managers and information technology it professionals working in business and government organizations 
since its founding in  learning tree has provided high quality training to over million it professionals and managers 
in fiscal year  learning tree provided training to  course participants 
approximately two thirds of learning tree participants come from fortune level companies  their international equivalents and government organizations  and approximately one third come from small and medium size companies 
learning tree offers a broad  proprietary library of intensive instructor led courses from two to five days in length  comprising different course titles representing over  hours of training as of september  learning tree courses focus on web development  operating systems  programming languages  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  wireless technologies  open source applications  project management  leadership and professional development  and other key business skills 
by the end of fiscal year  learning tree had expanded its management course offerings to management courses in order to meet demands for these courses from both technical and non technical managers 
the actual number of course titles that learning tree will execute  and their delivery dates  are subject to the rate of new developments and perceived customer demand 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate are not sufficient to justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  learning tree may or may not develop more titles than it retires in any period 
course development costs may increase in the future if learning tree expands its course library 
learning tree uses a well defined  systematic approach in developing and updating its course library to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
learning tree s proprietary course development process also allows it to customize its courses for delivery at its customers sites 

table of contents learning tree designs its own vendor independent it courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective of software and hardware products with the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors in a single course 
learning tree management courses  while addressing core concepts and theory  focus heavily on providing skills  tools  and techniques that participants can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs 
learning tree courses are highly interactive 
they are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
based on their sophistication and quality  all of learning tree s courses are recommended for one to two semester hours of college credit by the american council on education 
learning tree is a trusted cpe provider of the international information systems security certification consortium isc in addition  learning tree is on the national association of state boards of accountancy national registry of cpe sponsors and is a registered education provider of the project management institute pmi 
learning tree had instructors as of september   each of whom was a practicing professional combining expert knowledge with extensive practical experience 
on average  each expert instructor teaches approximately eleven learning tree course events per year on an as needed basis 
when they are not teaching  learning tree instructors apply the same it and management skills as either full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
learning tree offers its proprietary courses through local operations in the united states  united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generates approximately half of its revenue internationally 
each learning tree operating subsidiary is staffed by local nationals responsible for the sale and delivery of learning tree courses in that country 
learning tree s infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow it to coordinate  plan and deliver its courses at learning tree s education centers  hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal year  learning tree presented courses in countries 
learning tree has structured its business so that the majority of its course costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
learning tree schedules its course events throughout the year based on its assessment of demand 
since learning tree s instructors typically work full time or as consultants in business and industry  or in the case of management instructors as industry consultants and facilitators  and teach learning tree course events as needed  learning tree s instructor related costs are largely variable 
however  learning tree s expenses associated with its own education centers and course equipment are largely fixed 
learning tree adjusts its expenditures for sales and marketing depending on its strategic objectives  which generally include an assessment of learning tree s expectations for influencing future customer demand  market conditions and other factors 
however  if learning tree s expectations regarding the results of its marketing efforts prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on learning tree s results of operations 
recent trends 
as it has for more than years  learning tree continues to focus on enhancing quality levels in its core strengths its expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms and worldwide course delivery systems 
learning tree believes that quality and customer satisfaction remain the underlying driving force for its long term success 
during fiscal year  learning tree s course participants rated learning tree s instructors and courses at the highest level in learning tree s history 
learning tree s customers have continued to respond positively to learning tree s recent increase in the breadth and depth of learning tree s management course offerings 
at september   learning tree offered titles in its management curriculum representing of learning tree s entire course library  compared to titles  which represented at the same point in fiscal year learning tree intends to meet the demand for these courses by continuing to develop additional management course titles  and by increasing the marketing for learning tree s management course program 

table of contents learning tree s business continues to be influenced by world events  by the economy  and by corporate spending trends for it  among other factors 
learning tree believes that the best way to counteract adverse market trends is to use a strong  focused  integrated marketing and sales strategy that clearly and visibly helps learning tree s customers identify specific applications of training services to improve their business performance 
accordingly  learning tree continues to assess alternative approaches to sales and marketing with the objective of improving its performance under current market conditions 
however  there is no guarantee that these approaches will be successful 
see exhibit beginning with the second quarter of fiscal year  learning tree adopted a or week fiscal year  changing its year end and quarter end dates to the friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter 
accordingly  learning tree s fiscal year ended on october  and fiscal year ended on september  learning tree made this change in order to better align its external financial reporting with the way learning tree operates its business 
results of operations the following table summarizes learning tree s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  october  september  restated restated revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes and cummulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  learning tree s revenues were million compared to million in fiscal year learning tree reported a loss from operations of million in fiscal year compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior year 
net loss for fiscal year was  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal year 
table of contents revenues 
learning tree s fiscal year revenues primarily reflect the net effect of a decrease in average revenue per attendee  partially offset by increases in the number of course participants and the net effect of changes in exchange rates 
during fiscal year  learning tree trained a total of  course participants  an increase of approximately from the prior year s  course participants 
for fiscal year  average revenue per attendee was lower than in fiscal year however  excluding a effect from changes in foreign exchange rates  learning tree s average revenue per attendee declined in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
accordingly  exchange rate fluctuations impact both learning tree s reported revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
see exhibit excluding the effect of exchange rates  the decrease in average revenue per attendee primarily reflects an increase in the proportion of two and three day events as well as an increased number of on site course events for the newer titles in learning tree s management curriculum  which typically have lower average revenue per attendee than learning tree s four and five day it course titles and its older management course titles 
cost of revenues 
learning tree s cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel and living expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
learning tree s cost of revenues for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year this increase primarily reflects the net effect of increased numbers of events compared to the prior year and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by a reduction in the average number of attendees per event and the effects of learning tree s ongoing cost reduction and control measures 
during fiscal year  learning tree presented  course events compared to  course events in fiscal year in fiscal year  learning tree s cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal year changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially affect learning tree s gross profit percentage since exchange rate changes increased learning tree s cost of revenues by approximately the same percentage as they increased learning tree s revenues 
in fiscal year  excluding the effect of exchange rates  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflects an decrease in average revenue per event  partially offset by the effect of a decrease in average cost per event as compared to fiscal year the decrease in average revenue per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  primarily reflects the combined effect of a change in mix to a greater proportion of courses conducted at customer sites and a reduction in the average number of attendees per event 
courses held at customer sites generally have lower revenues per event compared to those conducted at learning tree education centers 
the improvement in average cost per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  primarily reflects the results of learning tree s ongoing cost reduction and control measures  including reductions in instructor related costs 
course development expenses 
learning tree maintains a disciplined process for the development of new courses and the maintenance of existing courses 
the costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred  and are included in course development expenses 
in fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues  the same as in fiscal year expenditures on course development were million for both fiscal years and during fiscal year  learning tree released additional course titles on topics that included oracle database g  storage networks  microsoft excel  sql server reporting services  java  wireless security  patch management  virtual technology  oracle g backup  recovery and server tuning hands on  php for web development hands on  computer forensics  
net development  assertiveness skills and business and report writing 

table of contents at the end of fiscal year  learning tree offered different course titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared to titles a year earlier 
the decrease in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  the cost of designing  producing and distributing direct mail marketing and media advertisements and the cost of information systems to support these activities 
for fiscal year  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal year during fiscal year  sales and marketing decreased to million from million in fiscal year the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects a decrease from the prior year s elevated quantity of regular catalogs mailed as an experimental increase in marketing quantities  as well as lower costs for producing and mailing catalogs  partially offset by increased costs for sales staffing 
general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase primarily reflects the effect of million expended in learning tree s efforts to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as an increase of approximately  in fees for professional auditing and related services  and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by reduced costs of  related to subleasing portions of learning tree s united kingdom education center and the effects of various ongoing cost reduction efforts 
prior to fiscal year  learning tree subleased three floors in its united kingdom education center 
those subleases expired during fiscal year  and learning tree undertook efforts to find new tenants for those floors 
in fiscal year  learning tree recorded appropriate provisions for the cost of the vacant space as well as to reflect the anticipated difference between net sublease rental rates and learning tree s costs over the anticipated terms of the eventual subleases 
in fiscal year  learning tree negotiated and entered into a series of subleases which resulted in the aggregate subleasing of three and one half floors of the united kingdom education center 
the actual terms of those subleases varied from the assumptions used by learning tree in computing the fiscal year provision  and the additional provision amounting to  recorded in fiscal year correctly accounts for the terms of the executed subleases 
the amortization of these lease loss provisions  amounting to million in fiscal year  was recorded as a reduction in rent expense 
the balance of these reserves  amounting to  at september   will be amortized over the remainder of the sublease terms 
learning tree incurred a need for significant additional professional accounting review and tax services as a result of the restatement of prior years discussed in this annual report on form k 
these increased services resulted in an increase of approximately  in associated fees from the fees recorded for accounting review and audit services in fiscal year in january  the company s board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting for all stock options that first vested on or before april this action affected unvested options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at exercise prices per share of between and  all of which were scheduled to vest by april no other terms for such stock options were modified 
the board of directors took this action to reduce administrative and financial and accounting issues associated with monitoring the vesting of options with exercise prices which were significantly above the company s current stock prices 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
in fiscal year  other income expense  net increased to income of million from million in fiscal year primarily because of higher interest income partially offset by 
table of contents the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and a gain of  realized in fiscal year from the liquidation of an investment in collegis  inc interest income increased million compared to fiscal year due to the effect of higher interest rates partially offset by a decline in the amount of learning tree s interest bearing investments primarily resulting from repurchases of learning tree s common stock  investments in course and office equipment  expenditures for leasehold improvements  and the use of cash in operations 
learning tree recorded foreign exchange losses of  in fiscal year compared to foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal year the fiscal year losses arose from cash balances  receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of learning tree 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  learning tree s income tax provision increased to million from  in fiscal year primarily as the result of the recording of a one time charge of million to reflect learning tree s inability to amend its fiscal year federal income tax return for an understated income tax deduction after the statute of limitations for that return expired in june see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
learning tree s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year principally due to the increase in pre tax income and the effects of state income taxes  foreign taxes and tax credits  offset by the loss of the stock option benefit 
geographic segments 
learning tree has education centers in six countries around the world  and has historically derived approximately half of its revenues from outside the united states 
the united states recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year revenues from europe were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year canada recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year and asia recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although learning tree s consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  several of learning tree s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of learning tree s subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on learning tree s results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on learning tree s foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on learning tree s foreign expenses 
the impact of future exchange rates on learning tree s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore continues to be subject to such risks 
in the future  learning tree may undertake such hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by learning tree would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
see exhibit recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfasr supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb and its related interpretations 
generally  the approach to accounting in sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statements of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award 
as permitted by sfas  learning tree currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value provisions of apb and  as such  generally recognized no compensation costs for employee stock options 
accordingly the adoption of sfas r s fair value method is expected to impact learning tree s results of operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had learning tree adopted 
table of contents sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of the consolidated financial statements 
sfasr also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow 
in april  the sec adopted a new rule that amends the compliance date for sfas r to be effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  thus  learning tree is required to adopt the standard as of october  sfas r offers several alternatives for implementation 
at this time  learning tree expects to use the modified prospective transition method 
learning tree is considering the implementation guidance for sfas r issued by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
in the adoption of sfas r 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections  sfas which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principles and error corrections by requiring retrospective application to prior period financial statements unless impracticable 
this statement is effective in fiscal years beginning after december  and learning tree plans to adopt sfas on october  learning tree does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb also issued fsp no 
accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction of qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp provides that the new special tax deduction created in the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas and not as a tax rate reduction 
this pronouncement did not have any effect on learning tree s tax provision 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  learning tree s revenues were million compared to million in fiscal year learning tree reported a restated loss from operations of million in fiscal year compared to income from operations of million in the prior year 
net loss for fiscal year was  compared to net income of million in fiscal year learning tree s fiscal year financial results include a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter related to subleasing its united kingdom facilities see general and administrative expenses for further discussion 
revenues 
learning tree s fiscal year revenues primarily reflect the net effect of increased average revenue per attendee due to the effect of changes in exchange rates  offset by a decline in the number of course participants compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  learning tree trained a total of  course participants  a decrease of from the prior year s  course participants 
for fiscal year  average revenue per attendee was higher compared to fiscal year however  excluding a effect from changes in foreign exchange rates  learning tree s average revenue per attendee declined in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
accordingly  exchange rate fluctuations impact both learning tree s reported revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
see exhibit excluding the effect of exchange rates  the decrease in average revenue per attendee primarily reflects the effect of a change in course mix to a greater proportion of courses conducted at customer sites and a lower proportion conducted at learning tree education centers 
courses held at customer sites generally have lower revenues per attendee compared to those conducted at learning tree education centers 
cost of revenues 
learning tree s cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel and living expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 

table of contents learning tree s cost of revenues for fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year this increase primarily reflects the net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by the effect of a decrease in the number of course events and the effects of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures 
during fiscal year  learning tree presented  course events compared to  course events in fiscal year in fiscal year  learning tree s cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal year changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially affect learning tree s gross profit percentage since exchange rate changes increased learning tree s cost of revenues by approximately the same percentage as they increased learning tree s revenues 
in fiscal year  excluding the effect of exchange rates  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflects a decrease in average revenue per event  partially offset by the effect of a decrease in average cost per event compared to fiscal year the decrease in average revenue per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  primarily reflects the change in mix to a greater proportion of courses conducted at customer sites 
courses held at customer sites generally have lower revenues per event compared to those conducted at learning tree education centers 
the improvement in average cost per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  primarily reflects the results of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures  including reductions in instructor related costs and decreased staffing levels 
these decreases in cost per event were partially offset by the effect of increased allocated fixed costs per event  stemming from reduced utilization of learning tree s education centers and course equipment  as well as other fixed costs which were spread over fewer events 
course development expenses 
learning tree maintains a disciplined process to develop new courses and update its existing courses 
the costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred  and are included in course development expenses 
in fiscal year  course development expenses also included all costs of learning tree s e learning research and development activities  which were terminated in the second quarter of that year because learning tree was unable to find what it believed could be a profitable and sustainable e learning business model 
in fiscal years and  course development expenses were of revenues 
expenditures on course development increased slightly to million in fiscal year from million the year before 
this increase primarily reflects increased course development activities and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by the termination of all e learning research and development activities in the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  learning tree released additional course titles on technical topics that included wi fi networking  windows server  integrating microsoft access with sql server  oracle database g  and systems management server  as well as additional course titles on management topics that included leading virtual and remote teams  preparing for the project management professional pmp exam  performance management  time management  presentation skills  negotiation skills  project leadership  project quality management  microsoft project server for the enterprise  and a guide to information technology 
at the end of fiscal year  learning tree offered different course titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared to titles a year earlier 
the decrease in the number of titles in fiscal year reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  the costs of designing  producing and distributing direct mail marketing and media advertisements and the costs of information systems to support these activities 

table of contents for fiscal year  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects an increase in the number of regular catalogs mailed in fiscal year as an experimental increase in marketing quantities compared to the prior year  as well as learning tree s new management curriculum catalog which was introduced during the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  the increase in sales and marketing expenses reflects the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
these increases were partially offset by the effect of lower expenditures for marketing activities other than major mailings  lower sales and marketing staffing levels and lower sales commissions 
general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase primarily reflects the charge of approximately million described below related to subleasing portions of learning tree s united kingdom education center and administrative office facilities and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of various cost savings including reduced staffing levels and lower depreciation expense 
the million charge related to subleasing portions of learning tree facilities in the united kingdom was comprised of three components 
two of the components relate to a year lease that was executed in fiscal year for a building in london to house learning tree s united kingdom education center 
this building had sufficient space for learning tree s immediate classroom needs  plus three and one half floors for potential future classroom expansion that learning tree currently sublets to four subtenants 
the third component related to a charge for a portion of learning tree s united kingdom office space that was sublet in fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
in fiscal year  other income expense  net decreased to income of million from million in fiscal year primarily because of lower interest income 
interest income decreased  compared to fiscal year due to the effect of lower interest rates together with a decline in the amount of learning tree s interest bearing investments because of expenditures for repurchases of its common stock 
the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a  gain from the liquidation of a million minority interest equity investment in collegis  inc formerly eduprise 
com that learning tree had purchased in january learning tree recorded foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal year compared to foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal year these gains arose from cash balances  receivables and payables denominated in local currencies other than the functional currency of learning tree 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  learning tree s income tax provision decreased to  from million in fiscal year the decrease in the provision for income taxes is consistent with the company s decrease in income before provision for income taxes 
learning tree s effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this significant increase was principally due to the decrease in pre tax income and the effects of foreign taxes and other permanent differences 
geographic segments 
learning tree has education centers in six countries around the world  and has historically derived approximately half of its revenues from outside the united states 
the change in revenues in fiscal year primarily reflects the net effect of changes in exchange rates  offset by a decline in the number of course participants in all learning tree locations compared to fiscal year learning tree s operating subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france  sweden  canada and asia  reported a decline in revenues on a local currency basis 
however  due to changes in exchange rates in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  those locations reported an increase in revenues compared to fiscal year when their local currency revenues were translated into us dollars 
the united states recorded revenues of approximately million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year revenues from europe were million in fiscal year

 interim financial reporting 
historically  learning tree s quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and that is expected to continue in the future 
the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as i the frequency of course events  ii the number of weeks during which courses can be conducted in a quarter  iii the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of  and response to learning tree s direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  iv the timing of the introduction of new course titles  v the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in learning tree s education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins  vi competitive forces within markets served by learning tree  vii learning tree s ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  viii currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  ix natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and x general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results also occur as a result of differences in the timing of learning tree s spending on the marketing of its courses 
in addition  the timing of learning tree s spending on the development of its courses and other areas may also result  to a lesser extent  in quarter to quarter fluctuations 
see exhibit liquidity and capital resources learning tree s cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities decreased to million at september  from million at october  this decrease primarily reflects repurchases of learning tree s common stock amounting to million and investments in course and office equipment and leasehold improvements totaling million  offset by net cash provided by operations of million 
during fiscal years and  learning tree repurchased approximately  and  shares of its common stock on the open market at a total cost of million and million  respectively 
learning tree may make additional purchases through open market transactions  but has no commitments to do so 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
net working capital at september  was million 
during fiscal year  learning tree invested million in equipment and facilities compared to million in fiscal year although learning tree expects to continue to invest in additional equipment in fiscal year  learning tree had no material change in its future purchase obligations for catalog printing services  capital commitments or debt 
the aggregate purchase obligations as of september  under non cancelable printing contracts amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the asset retirement obligations liability amounting to million as of september  matures as follows including accretion to estimated future value year of lease expiration estimated aro liability in thousands 
table of contents these amounts relate specifically to asset retirement obligations associated with leases which terminate in the identified years  to the most significant of which is the lease for the company s united kingdom education center which terminates in fiscal year in the future  learning tree may use cash for acquisitions or other strategic transactions 
while learning tree has no current agreements in place or negotiations underway with respect to any acquisition or other strategic transaction  learning tree may  on occasion  evaluate acquisition or other strategic opportunities that appear to fit within its overall business strategy 
learning tree believes its cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities and the cash provided by its operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
learning tree has not paid any cash dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes learning tree s contractual cash commitments at september  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year fiscal years fiscal and years fiscal and more than years fiscal through operating leases i employment contracts ii purchase commitments iii asset retirement obligations iv total i amounts exclude future minimum sublease rental income of million due in the future under noncancelable subleases

critical accounting estimates and policies management s discussion and analysis of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations is based upon learning tree s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the 
table of contents financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of learning tree s accounting policies 
learning tree s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of learning tree s critical accounting estimates and policies  defined as those policies that learning tree believes are the most important to the portrayal of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
learning tree offers its customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a training passport 
a training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in one of learning tree s courses is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of a training passport  learning tree records the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and the training passport selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average actual number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
each quarter the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for all active training passports and for all training passports sold thereafter is adjusted 
learning tree believes it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of its passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
learning tree believes that the use of historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by the tens of thousands of passport holders since the inception of the program in fiscal year the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate utilized by learning tree 
although learning tree has seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  it monitors such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  learning tree would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an error in estimation  but the error would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the twelve month life of each training passport 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
learning tree uses estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  based on its analysis of various factors  including learning tree s historical collection experience  current trends  specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful  and a percentage of learning tree s past due accounts receivable 
although learning tree s estimates for this reserve have in the past been reasonably accurate  these estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment 
learning tree s trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
operating leases 
learning tree leases education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements 
certain of these operating leases include space that is not used by learning tree and which is currently subleased 
learning tree calculates and records a provision related to those subleases based on the difference between the present value of the net aggregate sublease rental income and the present value of the 
table of contents prime lease costs for the subleased space throughout the term of the subleases 
periodically  learning tree evaluates the nature and extent of each of the individual provisions and makes adjustments each quarter  as appropriate  as new information becomes available or subsequent developments occur 
in  learning tree entered into a year lease on a building in london to house its united kingdom education center 
this building had sufficient space for learning tree s immediate classroom needs  plus additional space for potential future classroom expansion that learning tree has subleased 
during fiscal year  some of the company s subleases expired and  accordingly  during portions of fiscal years and  these facilities had vacant space that the company was not using 
all such space was sublet during fiscal year  at various points during the year 
to account for the vacant space during the period of vacancy  the company recorded the estimated fair value of its liability for rental costs amounting to million that it would incur under the operating lease without economic benefit 
the estimated fair value of the liability for the vacant space was initially determined based upon the remaining lease costs  based on the operating lease agreement  reduced by estimated future sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property based upon prevailing real estate market conditions 
as the vacant space was sublet  the estimates were refined and adjusted to reflect the actual terms of the subleases negotiated with the subtenants 
the computed long term portion of such liabilities is recorded as deferred facilities rent in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with the short term portion being recorded in other accrued liabilities 
the amortization of the lease provision  amounting to million in fiscal year  was recorded as a reduction in rent expense 
the liability of  at september  recorded by the company reflects the company s best estimate based upon the information available 
asset retirement obligations 
learning tree has adopted sfas  which requires learning tree to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated future cost to retire an asset 
for learning tree  most asset retirement obligations aro liabilities are associated with any leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  learning tree is obligated to remove in order to restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease agreement 
at the inception of such a lease  learning tree records the aro as a liability and also records a leasehold improvement asset in an amount equal to the fair value of the liability 
the capitalized leasehold improvement asset is then depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
any difference between the actual costs incurred for the eventual and the estimated liability previously recorded  will be recognized as a gain or loss in learning tree s statement of operations at the termination of the lease 
the fair value of any such aro liability is estimated in three steps the costs of leasehold restoration are estimated as if they were to be performed at the inception of the lease  the cost is forecast into the future by applying an inflation rate in effect at the time of adoption together with a market risk premium for a contractor s risk for performing the work in the future  and the present value of this future cost is computed by discounting it at learning tree s credit worthiness interest rate determined at the inception of the lease 
the aro liability is subsequently increased annually by interest accretion throughout the term of the lease 
in future periods learning tree may also make adjustments to the aro liabilitiy as a result of the availability of new information  technology changes  changes in labor costs and other factors 
the estimate of aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
learning tree cannot predict what revisions to these assumptions will be required in future periods 
the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
these include estimates for expected future cash flows related to contractual obligations  primarily to restore leased space back to open floor layouts as required by the lease agreements  the company s credit adjusted risk free rate that considers the company s estimated credit rating as of the date of lease inception  the market risk premium as determined by the company based on the length of the individual leases  and the relevant inflation factor in each impacted country 
for the more significant aros  the company obtained third party restoration estimates specific to those leases 
learning tree cannot predict the type of revisions to these assumptions that will be required in future periods due to the availability of additional information  technology changes  the price of labor costs and other factors 

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
learning tree course events range from two to five days  with an average of approximately four days 
as stated above  beginning with the second quarter of fiscal year  learning tree adopted a or week fiscal year in order to better align its external financial reporting with the way learning tree operates its business 
under this method  each fiscal quarter ends on the friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter 
since all courses have a duration of five days or less  and all courses begin and end within the same calendar week  under the or week fiscal year method all revenues and related direct costs for each course event are recognized in the week and the fiscal quarter in which the event takes place 
prior to the adoption of the or week method  it was learning tree s policy to recognize revenues and the related direct costs of course events as courses are delivered on a straight line basis 
however  for administrative purposes  the revenues and the related costs of course events were recorded upon commencement of each course event  unless the difference between learning tree s revenue recognition policy and recording revenues and related course costs on a straight line basis was more than inconsequential 
in addition to its training passports  learning tree also offers a multiple course sales discount referred to as training vouchers 
under learning tree s training vouchers  a customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
if a training voucher expires unused  learning tree records the selling price of the expired training voucher as revenue 
prepaid marketing expenses 
prepaid marketing expenses are charged to income in the month in which the advertising materials are mailed since the benefit period for such costs is short and the amount of such future benefit is not practically measurable 
course development costs 
course development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred 
stock based compensation 
learning tree uses the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for its stock option plans 
the exercise price of all stock options granted under learning tree s stock option plans was equal to their fair market value at the dates of the grants 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized during fiscal years and for stock options granted to employees 
long lived assets 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  such as equipment  property and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
income taxes 
learning tree provides for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against assets  including net operating losses  if it is anticipated that some or all of the asset may not be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
learning tree operates as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries 
each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
since taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and tax rates vary from country to country and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  learning tree s consolidated effective tax rate may vary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  learning tree is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and these authorities may challenge the amount of taxes due 
while learning tree believes its tax 
table of contents positions comply with applicable tax law  learning tree evaluates exposures associated with various tax filing positions and records reserves for uncertain tax positions 
learning tree believes these reserves are adequate 
learning tree s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if learning tree determines the reserves are not required  or if the company was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
outlook throughout this document  there have been various forward looking statements 
however  all of the statements in this section are forward looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those detailed from time to time in learning tree s filings with the securities and exchange commission and in exhibit since economic and market conditions may change at any time  learning tree s future revenues  plans and expenditures will vary from the observations below  and these differences may be material 
recent trends 
learning tree has recently experienced increased demand for its management courses  and believes these results validate previous learning tree statements about the market need for training in project management  personal effectiveness and other key business skills 
this experience strengthens learning tree s resolve to further develop and grow its management curricula 
new and innovative course titles such as managing information overload  managing with metrics and power excel address learning tree customers expressed need for management training with real world application and focus 
learning tree intends to develop more new titles like these  which help attendees directly improve their performance in their jobs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  learning tree offered titles in its management curriculum representing of its entire course library  compared to titles  which represented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as it has for the past years  learning tree continues to emphasize excellence in educating and training it professionals and managers from government and commercial customers around the world 
as learning tree continues to grow  adapt and evolve its course library based on customer needs  it also maintains focus on advancing the state of the art in the training industry and providing the highest quality training available 
learning tree continues its tradition of excellence today by improving its core strengths its expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms and worldwide course delivery systems 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  learning tree maintained its record high levels in course participants evaluations of the quality of its instructors and courses 
effect of exchange rates 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars and fluctuations in exchange rates will affect future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if the exchange rates of december  remain stable through the remainder of fiscal year  learning tree s revenues would have an unfavorable affect of approximately in the first quarter and approximately for the full fiscal year compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal year conversely  learning tree s expenses would be favorably affected by similar percentages in these periods 
first quarter revenues 
a number of factors may influence learning tree s revenues in its first fiscal quarter ending december  first  at september   learning tree s backlog of million was about higher than it had been on october  this september  backlog was not impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
eight weeks later  at november   learning tree s overall backlog of million was higher than at november  and  at november   the sum of learning tree s revenues for october and november courses plus its backlog for december courses was lower than it had been at november  these november  backlogs each included a unfavorable effect from changes in foreign exchange rates 

table of contents second  deferred revenues  which principally consist of the remaining value of prepaid learning tree passports and vouchers  decreased from million at july  to million at september  however  almost all of this decrease is the result of changes in foreign exchange rates rather than any material changes in the sales or usage rates of passports and vouchers 
learning tree believes that its revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year will be approximately million to million  or essentially the same as in the prior year period 
first quarter gross profit 
learning tree expects its gross profit percentage in the first quarter of fiscal year to be between and first quarter operating expenses 
learning tree expects overall operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year to be approximately million  about the same as in the same quarter a year earlier 
learning tree anticipates that first quarter operating expenses will reflect reduced general and administrative costs and reduced marketing costs compared to the same period a year earlier  offset by an expected increase in product development costs and costs associated with recognition of expenses related to the learning tree stock option program in accordance with its implementation of sfas r 
the expected decrease in general and administrative costs primarily relates to the cessation of costs related to subleasing space in learning tree s united kingdom education center 
the anticipated increases in product development spending relate to the development of an increased number of course titles in the first quarter of fiscal year compared to the same quarter of the prior year 
fiscal year is the first year in which learning tree is required to deduct the expenses of its employee stock option program  in accordance with sfas r 
during the first quarter of fiscal year learning tree expects that its expenses related to stock options will be approximately the same as the quarterly pro forma expenses it reported for fiscal year first quarter operating income 
based on the above forecasts  learning tree expects operating income for the first quarter of fiscal year to be approximately million to million 
first quarter interest income 
learning tree s interest income reflects changes in interest rates  as well as changes in cash and available for sale securities balances 
learning tree expects first quarter interest income to be approximately the same as it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  or approximately  first quarter net income 
based on the above  learning tree expects net income for the first quarter of fiscal year to be approximately million to million 
fiscal year tax rate 
presently  learning tree estimates that its effective tax rate in fiscal year will range between and 
future outlook 
over the last years  learning tree has built a strong position as the world s leading  vendor independent provider of training for managers and technology professionals 
learning tree s instructors  its content  its classrooms and its delivery continue to raise the standards for quality and effectiveness in the industry 
the goal of learning tree s quality processes and training methods is that each and every individual learning tree trains  acquires the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in his or her job 
learning tree remains committed to the proposition that the long term success of its customers depends in part on their investment in technology and in the training of their personnel to leverage that investment 
learning tree looks forward to continuing to help its customers maximize the productivity and the effectiveness of their people 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk learning tree is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  learning tree uses sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
interest rate risk 
learning tree s cash equivalents and available for sale securities are diversified and consist primarily of investment grade securities of high quality financial institutions and corporations 
the fair value of learning tree s portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in the rates of interest due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
learning tree does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk 
learning tree s consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars  while the operations of its foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
consequently  changes in exchange rates can result in exchange gains or losses 
to perform the sensitivity analysis  learning tree assesses the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of a hypothetical change in the value of foreign currencies  assuming no change in interest rates 
as of september   the result of a uniform change in the values of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar for intercompany exposures with all other variables held constant  would be immaterial to learning tree s results of operations 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
in the future  learning tree may undertake such transactions  however  any hedging techniques implemented by learning tree might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations
