item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading developer of semiconductor system solutions for wireless communications products 
we combine our wireless systems and software expertise with high performance radio frequency  or rf  mixed signal and digital semiconductor design skills to provide highly integrated chipsets that are manufacturable on low cost  standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  processes 
we were incorporated in may and commenced operations in december through december   we were engaged principally in research and development 
we first generated meaningful revenue from sales of our products in the fourth quarter of and have experienced increased revenue and chipset volumes while lowering our average selling price for our chipsets during each of the years ended december  through december  during  we began volume shipments of our first single chip wireless solution and introduced additional single chip solutions in  including our first pas cellular solution 
these single chip solutions are generally priced lower than the combined average selling prices of our multi chip solutions and have contributed to the decline in our average selling prices in and therefore  the average selling price per chipset may continue to decline as our single chip volume increases 
we generated net income for the first time during the year ended december  and again in through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our product portfolio includes various generations of our radio on a chip  media access controller baseband and wireless system on a chip products supporting the institute of electrical and electronics engineers  or ieee  family of wireless local area networking  or wlan  standards  including the b  g and a standards 
these products are sold together as chipsets as part of a wireless system solution that also incorporates software and system level reference designs or are sold as a single chip wireless solution that integrates the radio  media access controller and baseband onto one chip 
our wireless systems solutions are used in a variety of applications in the retail wireless networking  personal computer oem  enterprise and carrier infrastructure equipment  mobile communications and consumer electronics markets 
in addition  since june we have been shipping our cellular solution for personal access systems  or pas  also referred to as personal handyphone systems  or phs  consisting of a single chip that implements a complete cellular transceiver  baseband  application processor  audio paths  power management  keyboard  speaker and display interfaces 
pas phs  which is widely deployed in china  japan and taiwan  is an advanced time division multiple access time division duplex technology operating at ghz providing high quality voice  advanced data services and long battery life 
our unique  highly integrated single chip solution for pas products provides full support for the pas networking standard and a robust set of product features at a competitive price 
revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wlan chipset products  pas chip solutions and  to a lesser extent  from licensed software and services 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
original equipment manufacturers  or oems  utilize our chipsets in developing their wireless system solutions such as access point  cardbus handsets and integrated circuit card products 
some oems purchase chipsets directly from us and manufacture their products 
other oems utilize original design manufacturers  or odms  to design and build subsystem products that the oem then purchases from the odm and incorporates into the oem s wireless system solution 
accordingly  we ship our products either directly to the oem or to the odm based on the requirements of each oem 
purchase orders are received from an oem or an odm and we generally recognize revenue based on the shipment of chipsets to this customer 
a single odm usually provides our chipsets to numerous oems 
however  we attempt to maintain a close relationship with the target oem to monitor end market demand 
due to the use of odms  our direct customer base is relatively concentrated  although we believe that the number of total oems who purchase our chipsets through odms is broader 
we anticipate that we may continue to experience changes in our odm customer base as our end customers change odms for a variety of reasons while still using our chipsets 
we provide customer incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives 
table of contents that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual sales data submitted by the customers differs significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue in particular periods 
we expect to continue to have major concentrations of sales to a relatively small list of odm customers 
the following table shows the customers that represented greater than of revenue for the years ended december   and december  alpha networks  inc hon hai precision industry cameo communications  inc askey computer corporation less than in the applicable period 
substantially all of our sales are to customers outside the united states and canada 
sales to customers in asia accounted for of net revenue in and of net revenue in each of and because many of our odm customers are located in asia  we anticipate that a majority of our revenue will continue to be represented by sales to customers in that region 
although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in asia  we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers are then sold through to oems outside of asia 
all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold relates primarily to the purchase of silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  test and inbound and outbound shipping of our chipsets  costs of personnel  materials and occupancy associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  royalty costs and writedowns to state inventory at the lower of cost or market caused by product obsolescence and transitions from older to newer products 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes accruals for warranty obligations  which we record when revenue is recognized 
because we do not have long term  fixed supply agreements  our wafer  assembly and test costs are subject to changes based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from foundries  we also bear the yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into finished goods 
research and development 
research and development expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs related to development employees and contractors  mask and reticle costs  prototype wafers  software and computer aided design software licenses  intellectual property license costs  reference design development costs  development testing and evaluation costs  regulatory testing costs  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we invest to develop new products to be competitive and address new markets in the future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for marketing and selling personnel  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  public relations  promotional and other marketing expenses  travel  trade show expenses  depreciation expenses and allocated occupancy costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for general and administrative personnel  professional fees and banking fees  charges related to allowance for doubtful accounts and allocated occupancy costs 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and incur costs related to the anticipated growth of our business 

table of contents stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock  we have recorded an aggregate of million in stock based compensation 
these awards were considered compensatory because the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant was greater than the exercise price 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  in stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
we are amortizing deferred stock based compensation over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four to five years using the graded vesting method 
this deferred stock based compensation balance will be amortized as follows  assuming no forfeiture of awards  during   during  and  during however  we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of so the amounts of stock based compensation that will be expensed in  and will be considerably greater than these amounts 
interest income and expense 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
interest expense consists of interest on our revolving line of credit  equipment loans and equipment lease 
provision for income taxes 
from inception through december   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  in related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the tax expense of  in consists primarily of us alternative minimum tax and foreign income taxes  while the tax expense of  in  consists entirely of foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from three sources the sale of our wireless chipsets and reference designs  our licensed software and technical documentation  and service and support revenue relating to the licensed software 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for the products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
we provide customer incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
estimated incentive amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
table of contents and are based on agreements between us and our customers 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual claims submitted by the customers differ significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in a particular period 
inventory valuation 
we continually assess the recoverability of our inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions 
forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales 
we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost using the first in  first out method or its current estimated market value 
we adjust our inventory to the estimated lower of cost or market value to account for its obsolescence or lack of marketability 
adjustments are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options rather than adopting the alternative fair value accounting provided under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
therefore  we do not record any compensation expense for stock options we grant to our employees where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
we comply with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures  which require that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options 
in calculating such fair value  there are certain assumptions that we use  as disclosed in note of our audited financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
we are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of and expect that the additional expenses recorded under sfasr will have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
the pro forma disclosures of the impact of sfas no 
provided in note to the consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the impact of adopting sfas r 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our receivables are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make collection of our accounts receivable more difficult  require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and negatively affect our working capital 
product warranty reserve 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our chipset suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacement chipsets and inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing a chipset after failure 
we continuously monitor chipset returns for warranty and maintain an accrual for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual failure rates  cost of chipset replacement and inbound and outbound freight costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual would be required 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
on a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income

in february  we raised million in our initial public offering of common stock 
prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock  capital equipment loans and lease lines and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
operating activities 
our operating activities provided cash in the amount of million in and used cash in the amount of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided in operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the net income generated in the increase in cash used in operating activities in compared to was due to an increase in working capital requirements  partially offset by generating net income in compared to a net loss in our accounts receivable decreased by million in as a result of improved collection efforts and increased by million and million in and  respectively  related to increased revenue and the timing of customer payments

our accounts payable increased by million in  decreased by million in and increased by million in the increases in accounts payable in and were primarily due to the increase in inventory to meet increased demand for our products 
the decrease in accounts payable in related primarily to the timing of inventory purchases and 
table of contents payments to our vendors 
our accrued and other liabilities increased by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of million associated with an increase in our headcount 
the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in accrued customer incentives associated with increases in revenues during the year 
the increase in was primarily due to growth in accrued compensation and benefits associated with an increase in our headcount  and a million growth in accrued customer incentives associated with an increase in revenue during the year 
investing activities 
our investing activities provided million in primarily from maturities of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment 
our investing activities used million in primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities and property and equipment  partially offset by maturities of marketable securities 
our investing activities provided cash of million in  which resulted primarily from maturities of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment

we anticipate that further capital expenditures will be required to support future growth 
financing activities 
our financing activities provided cash of million in  million in  and million in financing activities in primarily represented exercises of options to purchase our common stock and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayment of an equipment loan 
financing activities in primarily represented proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our initial public offering of million  exercises of options to purchase our common stock and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayments of short term borrowings  equipment loans and capital lease obligations 
financing activities in primarily represented proceeds from exercises of options to purchase our common stock and proceeds from borrowings against the revolving line of credit  and borrowings against an equipment loan  partially offset by repayments  against the equipment loans and capital leases 
our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank provides financing up to million for working capital requirements 
the credit facility will expire on march  but we anticipate that we will renew the facility for an additional year 
as of december   no balances were outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated at the bank s prime rate 
the loan is collateralized by all of our tangible assets 
the loan agreement contains financial and nonfinancial covenants with which we must comply 
through december   we were in compliance with all required covenants 
we believe that research and development resources are required to expand our core technologies and product offerings 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these expenditures resulted in enhancement of our product offerings  technological know how and inventions that have yielded numerous issued and pending us patents 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and intend to fund these expenses with operating cash flow  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we expect to experience a significant increase in our operating expenses in absolute dollars  particularly in research  and development but also in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business strategy 
as a result  we anticipate that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
as of december  we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k

the guidance in this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not believe adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activity are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize the income without significantly increasing the risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on our interest income 
as of december   our investments were in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate notes  corporate bonds  market auction preferred stock and us government securities 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands  except percentages that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest 
table of contents rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in three months or less maturing between three months and one year maturing greater than one year total fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility provides financing up to million for working capital requirements 
as of december   no balances were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate 
we do not believe that a change in the prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions and as a result we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk
