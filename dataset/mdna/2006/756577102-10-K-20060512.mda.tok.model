item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global leader in providing open source software solutions to the enterprise  including our enterprise ready open source operating system platforms 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software 
because open source software code is freely shared  there are no licensing fees for the distribution of the open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself 
we provide value to our customers through the aggregation  integration  testing  certification  delivery  maintenance and support of our red hat enterprise technologies  and by providing a level of scalability  stability and accountability for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute 
moreover  because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings  opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities 
we sell our enterprise technologies  such as our operating system platform  enterprise linux  through subscriptions  and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers 
in addition  we provide certain managed services for each of our enterprise technologies  through rhn  as a component of our subscriptions 
we market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers including large enterprises  government organizations  small and medium size businesses and educational institutions 
we have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for red hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture 
since introducing our initial enterprise open source operating system platform  enterprise linux  it has gained widespread isv and ihv support 
we have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise operating system platform offerings and introducing new systems management services  clustering capability  file management systems  directory and certificate technologies and enhanced security functionality 
we intend to bring the value of open source technology to other key areas of the enterprise infrastructure as the development community efforts support and customer needs dictate 
we derive our revenues and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources i subscription revenue and ii training and services revenue  as described under critical accounting policies below 
we no longer sell retail products 
the arrangements with our customers that create enterprise subscription revenues are explained in further detail under critical accounting policies below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these arrangements typically involve subscriptions to enterprise linux or other enterprise technologies 
our revenues are affected by  among other factors  corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
in evaluating the performance of our business  we consider a number of factors  including total revenues  deferred revenues  operating income  operating margin and cash flows from operations 
revenue 
for the year ended february   total revenue increased to million from million for the year ended february  this increase resulted from an increasing level of adoption of enterprise linux as a primary computing platform by the larger enterprise customers  as well as growing penetration of the small and mid sized business market and increased adoption of other red hat enterprise technologies 
the success of our business model is predicated on the acceptance and widespread deployment of enterprise linux as a significant platform by the large enterprises  our ability to generate subscription revenues on a per installed system basis for red hat enterprise technology  our ability to increase annual average subscription revenues per customer by providing additional value to our customers in the form of additional technology infrastructure and by providing customers with additional services 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue  current and long term  balance at february  was million 
because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies  deferred revenues improve predictability of future revenues 
deferred revenues at february  have increased by more than as compared to the balance at february  of million 
subscriptions 
our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements 
these agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period 
the subscription entitles the end user to maintenance  which consists of a specified level of support  as well as security errata  bug fixes  functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscription through rhn 
our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive 
subscription revenue increased each quarter of fiscal  and  and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by the enterprise and our expansion of sales channels during these periods 
sales by geography 
we operate our business in three geographic regions the americas us  latin america and canada  emea europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific principally singapore  japan  india  australia  korea and china 
in fiscal  million or of our revenue was generated outside the united states compared to million or in fiscal while our revenue in both emea and asia pacific relative to total revenues for fiscal did not change significantly when compared to fiscal  the amount of our revenues generated from our international operations is expected to increase as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations 
we have offices in more than locations throughout the world 
income from operations and operating margin 
income from operations continues to grow as our revenue is growing at a faster pace than our operating expenses 
operating income was   and of total revenues for the years ended february   february  and february   respectively 
our growing profit margin is a result of both an increase in overall sales volume  as well as a higher mix of subscription revenues which have a higher profit margin than training and services revenues 
subscriptions made up  and of total revenues for the years ended february   february  and february   respectively 
the profit margin on subscriptions continues to generally trend upward and was  and for the years ended february   february  and february   respectively 
these two trends combined resulted in the improvement of our gross margin to  and for the same periods 
during these same periods  operating expense declined as a percentage of revenue further improving our operating margin 
cash  cash equivalents  investments in debt securities and cash flow from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in debt securities balances at february  totaled billion 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash flow from operations primarily related to the increase in sales of subscriptions during the period 
our significant cash balance gives us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisition opportunities  increasing investment in international areas and purchasing our own common stock and debt securities 
in fiscal  we focused on  and expect in fiscal to continue to focus on  among other things  i gaining widespread acceptance and deployment of enterprise linux as a mission critical operating system platform by the enterprise  ii generating increasing subscription revenue on a per installed system basis by renewing subscriptions and providing additional value to our customers and by growing the number of enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture and iii generating increased revenues by providing additional systems management  developer and other services as well as from additional market penetration through a broader and deeper set of channel partner relationships  including oems  and our own international expansion  among other means 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and deferred taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and statement of position no 
 modification of sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
we establish persuasive evidence of an arrangement for each type of revenue transaction based on either a signed contract with the end customer  a click through contract on our website whereby the customer agrees to our standard subscription terms  signed distribution contracts with oems and other resellers  or  in the case of individual training seats  through receipt of payment which indicates acceptance of our training agreement terms 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of direct and indirect sales of red hat enterprise technologies 
retail products are no longer sold 
accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding subscription agreement for the purchase of a subscription  subscription services are made available to the customer and the customer is billed 
the deferred revenue amount is amortized to revenue over the life of the subscription 
red hat enterprise technologies are generally offered with either one or three year base subscription periods  the majority of our subscriptions have one year terms 
under these subscription agreements  renewal rates are generally specified for one or three year renewal terms 
the base subscription entitles the end user to the technology itself and post contract customer support pcs consisting of a specified level of customer support and security errata  bug fixes  functionality enhancements to the technology and upgrades to new versions of the red hat enterprise technologies  each on a when and if available basis  during the term of the subscription 
we sell enterprise linux through two principal channels direct  which includes sales by our sales force as well as web store sales  and indirect  which includes distributors  resellers and oems 
we recognize revenue from the sale of red hat enterprise technologies ratably over the period of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement 
we do not sell the enterprise linux technology or the components of the pcs that are included in the subscription on a stand alone basis 
subscription arrangements with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements eg  software technology  maintenance  training  consulting and other services 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of its fair value when we can demonstrate sufficient evidence of the fair value of at least those elements that are undelivered 
the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is created by either i providing the customer with the ability during the term of the arrangement to renew that element at the same rate paid for the element included in the initial term of the agreement or ii selling the services on a stand alone basis 
in addition  our subscription revenue is partially derived from sales of our rhn offerings 
rhn is a red hat hosted  internet based set of services used to help promote the security  availability and management of our red hat technology solutions as well as provide functionality for managing other technologies 
rhn may be subscribed to at the time of  and in addition to  one of our enterprise linux offerings or on a stand alone basis 
revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription 
through retail distributors  we formerly sold red hat linux consumer products 
in accordance with sop  the revenue associated with products whose subscription period was days or less was recognized immediately because the cost to us associated with such subscriptions was de minimis 
for retail products whose subscription period for support services was greater than days  we recognized the revenue ratably over the period that the subscription services were provided beginning on the estimated date of purchase by the end user 
a reserve for sales returns was recognized for sales of retail software products to distributors  who had a right of return  based on our historical experience of sell through to the end user by the distributor 
the predominant portion of our retail distribution agreements provided that distributors only have days from date of original shipment to return unsold product 
we recognized revenues from sales of retail products with subscription periods less than days upon shipment to the distributor because we were able to estimate returns with a reasonable degree of accuracy  the fee was fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable was probable 
our retail customers did not receive the right to future upgrades or new versions of the technology 
training and services revenue training and services are comprised of revenue for consulting  engineering and customer training and education services 
consulting services consist of hourly arrangements  and revenue is recognized as these services are performed 
engineering services represent revenues earned under fixed fee arrangements with our oem partners and other customers to provide for significant modification and customization of our red hat enterprise technologies 
we recognize revenues for these fixed fee engineering services using the percentage of completion basis of accounting  provided we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion  the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
under the percentage of completion method  earnings under the contract are recognized based on the progress toward completion as estimated using the ratio of labor hours incurred to total expected project hours 
changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are known 
revenue for customer training and education services is recognized on the dates the services are complete 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate 
we perform this assessment on an annual basis  typically during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of realization of such deferred tax assets 
during the year ended february   we recorded a net tax expense of million 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of net operating losses from stock option expense deductions in the united states 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in making this assessment  management considers the historical trend of taxable losses  projected future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
as of february   the net deferred tax asset balance was million of which million is offset by a valuation allowance 
we continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from tax losses in the united states and asia pacific due primarily to i cumulative tax losses  ii uncertainty related to the future amount of stock option exercises and related tax deductions generated  and iii inherent difficulties in forecasting future taxable income as a result of rapidly changing technology and our competitive environment

we may redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  in cash at any time on or after january  holders of the debentures may require us to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  in cash on january of  and as of february   no debentures were redeemed 
accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in any such redemption

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
capital requirements we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our enterprise technologies  the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to funding the continued development of our enterprise linux products  accelerating the development of our systems management services  improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers  pursuing other strategic acquisitions and alliances  including the anticipated completion of the jboss acquisition  for which we have entered into an agreement and plan of merger described above under the heading subsequent event  and making possible investments in businesses  products and technologies 
we have and will continue to utilize cash and investments to fund  among other potential uses  purchases of our common stock  purchases of our convertible debentures  purchases of fixed assets and mergers and acquisitions 
given our historically strong operating cash flow and the billion of cash and investments held at february   we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations or our pending jboss acquisition  either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future 
however  we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet financing we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at february  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations convertible debentures  including related interest total accounting for stock options historically  we recognized stock option expense pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and have elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
effective for fiscal  we will adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  shared based payments sfas r 
both sfas and sfas r require us to make assumptions to determine the fair value of stock options  including the expected term of the options and the expected volatility of the underlying share price 
changes to such assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of our stock options  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we will be required to incorporate an estimate for forfeitures as we recognize the stock option expense over the requisite service period 
should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  our consolidated financial statements could be materially affected 
we plan to adopt sfas r on a prospective basis beginning on march  accordingly the consolidated results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical consolidated results of operations 
the adoption of sfas r will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  increasing cost of revenue  sales and marketing expense  research and development expense and general and administration expense 
we currently estimate the adoption of sfas r will reduce diluted earnings per share by in fiscal  however the amount may change based on the number of options granted  the underlying share price at the time of grant  our estimate of forfeitures and our assumptions used to determine the options value  such as expected term and expected volatility 
we will use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the value of employee stock options and will use binomial or lattice models to determine certain assumptions used in the black scholes merton pricing model  such as expected term 
expected volatility will be determined using a combination of historical volatility over a period equal to the expected term and implied volatility based on red hat options traded by the general public

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in prevailing interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates will result in an million change in interest income on an annual basis 
our convertible debentures are at fixed rates and therefore interest expense is not impacted by a change in rates 
the fair market value of the debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise 
generally  the fair market value of debt with conversion features permitting conversion into stock of the issuer  like the debentures  also increases as the market price of the underlying stock increases and decreases as the market price falls  assuming constant market interest rates 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the fair value of the debentures was approximately million and million based on quoted market prices as of february  and february   respectively 
investment risk the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on this investment portfolio  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in an approximate and million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment securities as of february  and february   respectively 
derivative instruments we did not hold derivative financial instruments as of february  foreign currency risk approximately of our revenues for the fiscal year ended february   were produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the income statements of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenues  operating expenses and net income for our non us segments 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease for our non us operations if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal  our revenues from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been higher than we reported using the exchange rates for fiscal  by approximately million 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates  while related revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month in which related transactions occur 
translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to stockholders equity and included in other comprehensive income
