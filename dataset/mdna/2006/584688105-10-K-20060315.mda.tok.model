item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to our critical accounting estimates discussed below and important factors set forth in this annual report  including under risk factors in item a of this annual report 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company that specializes in acute care hospital products 
to date  we have generated substantially all of our revenues from sales of our first product  angiomax bivalirudin 
angiomax is a direct thrombin inhibitor that was approved by the fda in december for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
in june  the fda approved new prescribing information for angiomax to also include patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions  or pci 
the expanded label also includes a new angiomax dosing recommendation  which is the same dose used in our replace clinical trial 
we are also currently developing angiomax for use in additional patient populations 
since we began selling angiomax in  revenues to date have been generated principally from sales of angiomax in the united states 
in september  we received authorization from the european commission to market angiomax as angiox bivalirudin in the member states of the european union for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients undergoing pci  and angiox has been sold in europe since that time 
in evaluating our operating performance  we focus on use of angiomax by existing hospital customers  as well as penetration to new hospitals  which are critical elements of our ability to increase revenues 
in  we expanded our sales force and increased our marketing capabilities 
we believe that our improved sales and marketing capabilities  and the expansion of our product label  will allow us to more effectively serve our existing customers and penetrate new hospitals 
except for  we have incurred losses on an annual basis since our inception 
the rate of angiomax sales growth was slower than we expected in the beginning of we incurred a net loss in of million  as our cost of sales together with our research and development expenses and our general and administrative expenses  exceeded our net revenue 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product acquisition  clinical trials  activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we outsource much of our clinical trials and all of our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  general corporate activities and costs associated with marketing and promotional activities 
in  we agreed with our largest wholesalers to enter into fee for service arrangements 
we believe that these arrangements have resulted in reductions in wholesaler inventories  improved margins  more predictable buying patterns and more frequent data on wholesaler inventory levels and hospital demand 
we expect our three largest wholesalers to reduce their angiomax inventory levels to an average of four to six weeks by the end of the first quarter of  including an expected aggregate reduction of approximately million in the first quarter of as a result  we believe reported net sales for angiomax in the first quarter of will be negatively affected 
we estimate that our wholesalers reduced their aggregate inventories of angiomax by approximately million over the last two quarters of we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the development of our products 
we plan to continue to invest in clinical studies to expand the approved indications for angiomax and to continue to develop clevidipine and cangrelor 
we also plan to continue our sales and marketing programs to promote angiomax  and to support programs to educate and inform physicians  nurses  pharmacists and other medical decision makers about the benefits of angiomax 
in light of these activities  our expanded sales force  and our plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of development stage products  approved products  or businesses that fit within our growth strategy  we will likely need to generate greater revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
we have accrued for us and state alternative minimum taxes  state taxes based on net worth and some income taxes in international jurisdictions in our financial statements to the extent these taxes apply 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
if not utilized  federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in and ending in we have provided a full valuation allowance against the potential tax benefit of our net operating losses since the realization of these benefits is not considered more likely than not 
the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited based upon changes in ownership pursuant to regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
application of critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition and inventory described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition product sales 
we sell our products primarily to domestic wholesalers and international distributors  who  in turn  sell to hospitals 
we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record allowances for chargebacks and other discounts  and accruals for product returns  rebates  and fee for service charges  at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such amounts 
in determining the amounts of certain of these allowances and accruals  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
for example  in determining these amounts  we estimate hospital demand  buying patterns by hospitals and group purchasing organizations from wholesalers and the levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past buying patterns by hospitals and group purchasing organizations will predict future product sales 
under the terms of our fee for service arrangements with our largest wholesalers  these wholesalers have agreed to provide us with more frequent data on wholesaler inventory levels and hospital purchases 
as these arrangements are implemented  we expect to apply this data in determining the amounts of certain of these allowances and accruals 
the nature of our allowances and accruals requiring critical accounting estimates  and the specific considerations we use in estimating their amounts  are as follows product returns 
our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending months after the labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the accrual for product returns  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might remain in their inventory to within six months of expiration and analyze the likelihood that such product will be returned within months after expiration 
in estimating the likelihood of product remaining in our wholesalers inventory  we rely on information from our wholesalers regarding their inventory levels  measured hospital demand as reported by third party sources and on internal sales data 
we also consider our wholesalers past buying patterns  estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped and the expiration dates of product currently being shipped 
in estimating the likelihood of product return  we rely primarily on historic patterns of returns and estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped 
during  million of angiomax was returned to us  representing less than of the total revenue from angiomax sales 
during  million of angiomax was returned to us  representing approximately of the total revenue from angiomax sales 
at december  and  our accrual for product returns was million and million  respectively 
despite higher revenue in compared to  we reduced our accrual for product returns at december  compared to december  in light of reduced levels of inventories held by wholesalers resulting from our fee for service arrangements and the low level of product returns during a change in our accrual for product returns in would not have had a material effect on our reported revenue in chargebacks and rebates 
although we sell angiomax primarily to wholesalers  we typically enter into agreements with hospitals  either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members  in connection with the hospitals purchases of angiomax from our wholesalers 
based on the terms of these agreements  most of our hospital customers have the right to receive a discounted price and volume based rebate on product purchases 
we provide a credit to the wholesaler  or a chargeback  representing the difference between the wholesaler s acquisition list price and the discounted price 
as a result of these contracts  at the time of product shipment  we must estimate the likelihood that angiomax sold to wholesalers might be ultimately sold to a contracting hospital or group purchasing organization 
we must also estimate the contracting hospital s or group purchasing organization s volume of purchases 
we base our estimates on the historic chargeback data we receive from wholesalers  which detail historic buying patterns and sales mix for particular hospitals and group purchasing organizations  and the applicable customer chargeback rates and rebate thresholds 
at december  and  our allowance for chargebacks was million and million  respectively 
our allowance for chargebacks was higher at december  because we instituted a price increase in december and certain of our hospital and group purchasing organizations were entitled to purchase product at the selling price prior to the increase for a period of time 
a change in our allowance for chargebacks would have had an approximate million effect on our reported revenue in our accrual for rebates was million at december  and million at december  a change in our allowance for rebates would have had an approximate million effect on our reported revenue in we have adjusted our allowances for chargebacks and our accruals for product returns and rebates in the past based on our actual sales experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances and accruals in the future 
we continually monitor our allowances and accruals and make adjustments when we believe actual experience may differ from our estimates 
the allowances included in the table below reflect these adjustments 
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our allowances and accruals over the course of and amounts in thousands returns chargebacks rebates balance at december  allowances for sales during actual credits issued for prior years sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  allowances for sales during actual credits issued for prior years sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  because our three largest us wholesalers accounted for approximately of our net revenue in  it is critical that these wholesalers have adequate inventory to meet product demand 
we only began selling angiomax in the united states in  and wholesaler buying patterns had sometimes been unpredictable 
in addition  product demand has generally not grown at a uniform rate 
for example  we experienced an accelerated rate of demand for angiomax following commercial launch and following the announcement of replace trial results in november as a result  we offered incentives to wholesalers from time to time in the past to ensure that they had what we believed to be appropriate stocks of product to meet expected increased demand as a result of events such as clinical trials  regulatory approvals and competitive developments  or to ensure that they were stocking within a normal range of inventory for a product like angiomax 
international distributors 
under our agreements with international distributors  we sell our product to these distributors at a percentage of the distributor s established net price 
the established net price is typically determined in the quarter in which we sell our products to these distributors based on the distributor s net selling price to its customers 
in those situations  usually prior to product launch  where product is sold prior to the establishment of the distributor s selling price  we initially record revenue at minimum prices outlined in these agreements and later adjust our selling price to the distributor once the distributor s net selling price is determined 
in accordance with the terms of these agreements  under no circumstances would the subsequent adjustment result in the net selling price being lower than the minimum price 
revenue from the sale of distribution rights includes amortization of milestone payments 
we record these milestone payments as deferred revenue until contractual performance obligations have been satisfied  and we then recognize these payments ratably over the term of these agreements 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we must estimate the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we review these estimates at least annually  which could result in a change in the deferral period 
inventory we record inventory upon the transfer of title from our vendors 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value and valued using first in  first out methodology 
angiomax bulk product is classified as raw materials  and its costs are determined using acquisition costs from our contract manufacturers 
we record work in progress costs of filling  finishing and packaging against specific product batches 
prior to fda approval of angiomax and its original manufacturing process in december  we expensed all of these costs as research and development 
we recorded as inventory any angiomax bulk drug product manufactured using the original manufacturing process to which we took title after fda approval 
together with our contract manufacturer  ucb bioproducts  we have developed a second generation chemical synthesis process  the chemilog process  for the manufacture of angiomax bulk drug substance 
in may  we received fda approval for this process 
all angiomax bulk drug product manufactured using the chemilog process to which title had transferred to us prior to fda approval was expensed as research and development at the time of transfer of title  and all bulk drug product manufactured after fda approval of the chemilog process has been and will continue to be recorded as inventory upon transfer of title from our vendor 
we review our inventory for slow moving or obsolete amounts based on expected revenues 
as of december  we had not recorded an allowance for slow moving or obsolete amounts of inventory 
if actual revenues are less than expected  we may be required to make allowances for excess amounts of inventory in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for as compared to million for in  we derived approximately million of net revenue from us sales of angiomax and approximately million of net revenue from international sales 
in  we derived approximately million of net revenue from us sales of angiomax and approximately million of net revenue from international sales 
we believe that the increase in us sales in was due primarily to increased purchases of angiomax by existing hospital customers  adoption of angiomax by new hospital customers and the effects of higher prices as a result of a price increase to our wholesalers december  partly offset by the impact of reduced purchases by wholesalers in connection with our new wholesaler arrangements 
we estimate that in implementing the planned inventory reduction  our wholesalers reduced their aggregate inventories by million over the last two quarters of one of our european distributors  nycomed danmark a s  began stocking angiox in the second half of in advance of the expected product launch  increasing our international revenue in our international revenue during  while higher than our international revenue in  reflected lower rates of purchases by nycomed following its initial stocking of the product 
net revenue year ended december  net revenue of total revenue of total revenue in thousands in thousands angiomax united states sales international sales total net revenue we expect our revenues in the first quarter of to continue to be affected by lower product sales related to our restructured wholesaler arrangements  as our wholesalers reduce inventory levels to an average of four to six weeks 
we expect our wholesalers to reduce their aggregate inventories of angiomax by approximately million in the first quarter of the timing of the inventory reduction  and the reduction in product sales in any quarter  may vary depending on the end user demand for the product and the actions of our wholesalers 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of international revenue from the amortization of milestone payments related to the million and million in non refundable fees received from nycomed 
these milestone payments were recorded as deferred revenue in and  respectively  and are being recognized ratably over the estimated term of our agreement with nycomed 
cost of revenue 
as shown in the table below  cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  in cost of revenue consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of angiomax sold  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen idec and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  such as distribution  storage  and handling 
cost of revenue year ended december  cost of revenue of total cost of total cost in thousands in thousands manufacturing royalty logistics total cost of revenue the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue is primarily a result of higher royalties based on a higher effective royalty rate under our licensing agreement with biogen idec offset partially by angiomax sales price increases in december research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a net million increase of angiomax clinical trial costs in  including a million increase in costs for acuity  our study of angiomax in patients presenting in the emergency department with acs  and a million increase in costs for a study of angiomax in ami patients  offset by a million decrease in expenses related to the evolution and choose trials and a million decrease in other angiomax studies 
angiomax manufacturing and development costs decreased by million in compared to due to lower expenses related to the development of an alternative method of manufacture and commercial supply with lonza 
the overall increase in research and development expenses for was also due to an increase of million in costs related to cangrelor development  million of increased infrastructure costs for data management  statistical analysis and product safety related costs and a million increase in business development activities 
the following table identifies for each of our major research and development projects  our spending for and spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods 
research and development spending year ended december  research and development of total r d of total r d in thousands in thousands angiomax clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total angiomax clevidipine cangrelor other angiomax 
in  we completed enrollment in two clinical trial programs evaluating angiomax for use as an intravenous anticoagulant in the treatment of arterial thrombosis  a condition involving the formation of blood clots in the arteries 
we completed enrollment in a phase iii trial program studying the use of angiomax as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in treatment of patients with a clinical condition known as heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome  or hit hitts  who are undergoing cardiac surgery  and a randomized phase iii trial called acuity studying the use of angiomax in patients presenting to the emergency department with acs who may be medically managed or ultimately treated in the catheterization laboratory or operating room 
in light of the completion of enrollment in these trials  we expect our clinical trial costs and our overall spending on research and development relating to angiomax to decrease in compared to  although we cannot quantify the amount of the expected decrease 
clevidipine 
we have commenced five phase iii clinical trials in two programs in cardiac surgery 
two of these trials are patient efficacy studies we completed in and results of which have been publicly announced 
the three other trials are safety studies that will provide data on a total of approximately  patients 
we expect to complete enrollment in these safety trials by the end of in light of these trials  we expect spending on clevidipine development to increase as a percentage of our overall research and development spending in compared to cangrelor 
we have designed a phase iii clinical trial program consisting of two trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cangrelor in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and we expect to begin enrolling patients in the first half of these two trials will provide data on approximately  patients 
in light of these trials  we expect spending on cangrelor development to increase as a percentage of our overall research and development spending in compared to other 
spending in this category consists of clinical trial infrastructure costs including data management  statistical analysis  product safety related costs and expenses related to business development activities 
in  we incurred business development expenses in connection with an agreement that we entered into with a third party to evaluate early stage compounds as well as expenses in connection with our evaluation of strategic opportunities for development and commercialization of cangrelor 
our success in expanding the approved indications for angiomax  or developing our product candidates  is highly uncertain 
in particular  estimating our future levels of spending on development of angiomax is uncertain following completion of enrollment of our acuity trial 
we cannot predict expenses associated with ongoing patient analysis or regulatory submissions  if any 
nor can we reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
while we are not yet able to quantify the total amount that we plan to spend on research and development in  we believe that the anticipated decrease in angiomax development spending together with the anticipated increase in development spending on clevidipine and cangrelor will result in a level comparable to research and development spending 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million was due to a million increase in employee related expense in connection with our sales force expansion in  which resulted in an increase in the size of our sales force by approximately  and a million increase in other expenses related to angiomax promotion  headcount additions and legal costs 
non cash stock compensation 
we recorded amortization expense for deferred compensation of approximately million for the year ended december  the amortization expense was included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and related to deferred stock compensation that was recorded in and amortized over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
as of december  there was no additional deferred stock compensation expense to be amortized 
in september  we amended the terms of fully vested options to purchase  shares of common stock that were granted to a non employee consultant in may in may  we granted options to a non employee consultant to purchase  shares at an exercise price based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the consulting agreement in april in addition  in november and december of we granted options to a non employee consultant to purchase  shares at an exercise price based on the fair market value of our common stock 
in each case  these options were valued utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
we recorded the  and million in non cash stock compensation expense associated with these options during and  respectively 
all of these options have now fully vested and we will not be required to record any additional associated non cash stock compensation expense 
other income 
other income  which is comprised of interest income  increased approximately to million for  from million for the increase in interest income of million was primarily due to higher rates of return on our available for sale securities in provision for income tax 
tax expense for was million as compared to million for the provision for mostly reflected state taxes based on net worth  and the provision for mostly reflected us alternative minimum taxes based on our first full year of profitability and state taxes based on net worth 
years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for as compared to million for as shown in the table below  for  approximately million of net revenue was derived from us sales of angiomax and approximately million of net revenue was derived from international sales  mostly related to stocking of angiox by one of our european distributors in anticipation of the launch of angiox in the european union 
virtually all of our revenue in was derived from us sales of angiomax 
we believe that in addition to the international sales  growth in was due primarily to increased use of angiomax in the united states by existing hospital customers  adoption of angiomax by new hospital customers and higher prices as a result of a price increase to our wholesalers in june net revenue year ended december  net revenue of total revenue of total revenue in thousands in thousands angiomax united states sales international sales total net revenue in the third quarter of  we shipped to nycomed vials of angiox to be sold in europe after european regulatory approval 
pursuant to our distribution agreement  nycomed paid a minimum transfer price per vial for these pre approval vials  which we recognized as revenue in the third quarter of and agreed that once the price of the product to end users was established  the effective transfer price payable to us for the pre approval vials would be recalculated based on the end user price 
the effective transfer price could not be less than the minimum transfer price 
following determination of the effective transfer price on a country by country basis in the fourth quarter of  nycomed paid to us on a per vial basis the difference between the effective transfer price and the minimum transfer price 
as a result  we recognized an additional million in revenue in the fourth quarter of relating to the third quarter product shipments 
in addition  we recognized million in revenue in the fourth quarter of relating to post approval product shipments to nycomed 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of revenue from milestone payments related to the million and million in non refundable fees received from nycomed 
these payments were recorded as deferred revenue in and  respectively  and are being recognized ratably over the estimated term of our agreement with nycomed 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in cost of revenue consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen idec and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  such as distribution  storage  and handling 
cost of revenue year ended december  cost of revenue of total cost of total cost in thousands in thousands manufacturing royalty logistics total cost of revenue our expenditures in connection with the manufacture of angiomax sold in and  and the decrease in our costs of manufacturing as a percentage of revenue from to  reflected our transition from selling angiomax manufactured using the original manufacturing process to selling angiomax manufactured using the chemilog process 
the cost of manufacturing using the chemilog process is lower than the cost of manufacturing using the original manufacturing process 
in  we sold angiomax that had been manufactured using the original manufacturing process until the third quarter 
late in the third quarter of  we began selling angiomax that was manufactured using the chemilog process prior to fda approval of that process in may all costs of manufacturing this angiomax had been expensed as research and development costs and therefore were not reflected in cost of revenue 
as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of revenue decreased substantially in the fourth quarter of compared to the first three quarters of in the first quarter of  we continued to sell angiomax produced using the chemilog process whose cost of manufacturing was previously expensed 
as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of net revenue continued to benefit 
late in the first quarter of  however  we began selling angiomax produced using the chemilog process to which we took title after fda approval of the process 
all costs of manufacturing this angiomax had been recorded as inventory  which is reflected in cost of revenue when sold  rather than as research and development expense 
since the second quarter of  and for the foreseeable future  we expect to sell angiomax produced using the chemilog process that has not been previously expensed 
we would expect  however  that our cost of manufacturing using the chemilog process will remain lower as a percentage of revenue than our cost of manufacturing using the original manufacturing process had been 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a net million increase of angiomax clinical trial costs in  including an million increase in costs for acuity  our study of angiomax in patients presenting in the emergency department with acs  offset in part by a million decrease in the expenses related to the replace trial 
angiomax manufacturing and development costs decreased by million in as chemilog inventory was expensed prior to fda approval of the chemilog process in may the overall increase in research and development expenses for was also due to an increase of million in costs related to trials studying clevidipine and an increase of million in infrastructure  cangrelor and other 
this increase was primarily due to million of cangrelor development costs and million of increased infrastructure costs for data management  statistical analysis and product safety related costs 
the following table identifies for each of our major research and development projects  our spending for and spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods 
research and development spending year ended december  research and development of total r d of total r d in thousands in thousands angiomax clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total angiomax clevidipine infrastructure  cangrelor and other selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million was primarily due to increased promotion expenditures  headcount additions and legal costs  including costs of settlement relating to an equal employment opportunity commission complaint 
non cash stock compensation 
we amortized the deferred stock compensation that was recorded in over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
we recorded amortization expense for such deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amortization expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december  there was no additional deferred stock compensation expense to be amortized 
in september  we amended the terms of fully vested options to purchase  shares of common stock that were granted to a non employee consultant in may in addition  in may we granted options to a non employee consultant to purchase  shares at an exercise price based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the consulting agreement in april in each case  these options were valued utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
we recorded the million and million in non cash stock compensation expense associated with these options during and  respectively 
all of these options have now fully vested and we will not be required to record any additional associated non cash stock compensation expense 
other income 
other income  which is comprised of interest income  increased over to million for  from million for the increase in interest income of million was primarily due to higher rates of return on our available for sale securities in provision for income tax 
tax expense for was million  mostly reflecting us alternative minimum taxes based on our first full year of profitability and state taxes based on net worth 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of common and preferred stock  sales of convertible promissory notes and warrants  interest income and revenues from sales of angiomax 
except for  we have incurred losses on an annual basis since our inception 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  cash flows 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  our major uses of cash during included net cash used in operating activities of million  which was partially offset by million in net cash provided by investing activities and million in net cash provided by financing activities 
during  we used cash in operating activities primarily to fund a net loss of million  planned growth in inventory of million  relating to purchases of angiomax bulk drug product and filling  finishing and packaging costs from our contract manufacturers to meet anticipated product demand growth  and a decrease in accounts payable of million due to timing of payments 
these cash uses were partly offset by an increase of million in accrued expenses  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
during  we received million in net cash in investing activities  which consisted of million in proceeds from the maturation and sale of available for sale securities  partially offset by the purchase of million of available for sale securities and purchases of million of fixed assets  mostly related to our office expansion  leasehold improvements and computer equipment for our sales force during  we received million in cash provided by financing activities  which consisted of net proceeds to us related to purchases of stock pursuant to option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan 
funding requirements 
we expect to devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts and to our sales  marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the commercialization of our products 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including the extent to which angiomax is commercially successful  the extent to which our international partners  including nycomed  are commercially successful  the progress  level and timing of our research and development activities related to our clinical trials with respect to angiomax  clevidipine and cangrelor  the cost and outcomes of regulatory submissions and reviews  the continuation or termination of third party manufacturing or sales and marketing arrangements  the cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  the status of competitive products  our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights  and the establishment of additional strategic or licensing arrangements with other companies  or acquisitions 
we believe  based on our operating plan as of the date of this annual report  which includes anticipated revenues from angiomax and angiox and interest income  that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities are sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months and beyond  without requiring us to obtain external financing 
we expect  however  to periodically assess our financing alternatives and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated revenues from angiomax or otherwise  or if we acquire additional product candidates  or if we otherwise believe that raising additional capital would be in our interests and the interests of our stockholders  we may sell equity or debt securities or seek financing through other arrangements 
any sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders  and debt financing may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
we cannot be certain that public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we seek to raise funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be required to relinquish rights to products  product candidates or technologies that we would not otherwise relinquish or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
these include commitments related to purchases of inventory of our products  research and development service agreements  operating leases and selling  general and administrative obligations 
future estimated contractual obligations as of december  are contractual obligations later years total inventory related commitments research and development operating leases selling  general and administrative total contractual obligations included above are inventory related non cancellable commitments to make payments to ucb bioproducts of million during and million during for angiomax bulk drug substance to be produced using the chemilog process and million in remaining angiomax related filling  finishing and packaging non cancellable commitments through we have million of total estimated contractual obligations for research and development activities  of which million is non cancellable 
we also have million of estimated contractual obligations for consulting  employment and professional services agreements associated with selling  general and administrative activities  of which million is non cancellable 
in addition to the contractual obligations above  we have agreed to make payments upon the achievement of sales and regulatory milestones  and agreed to pay royalties  to biogen idec under our product license agreement for angiomax and to astrazeneca under our product license agreements for clevidipine and cangrelor 
under the angiomax license  we have agreed to pay up to an additional million upon the first commercial sales of angiomax for the treatment of ami in the united states and europe 
under the clevidipine license  we have agreed to pay up to an additional million upon reaching certain regulatory milestones 
under the cangrelor license  we agreed to make milestone payments upon regulatory approval in major markets 
the foregoing amounts do not include royalties that we may also have to pay
