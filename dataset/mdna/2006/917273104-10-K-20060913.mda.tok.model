item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of selected factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a 
all forward looking statements included herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix  inc  based in minneapolis  develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive medical products for the treatment of urological disorders 
we have developed and offer non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of bph  a disease that dramatically affects more than million men worldwide by causing adverse changes in urinary voiding patterns 
we market our products under the targis and prostatron names during fiscal and coolwave name beginning in july  our systems utilize cooled thermotherapy  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without anesthesia or intravenous sedation and  as a result  can be performed in a physician s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph that is clinically superior to medication and is without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the adoption of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy is key to obtaining this reimbursement 
we estimate that to of patients who receive treatment in the united states will be eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market adoption of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
the level of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
beginning on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms replaced the reasonable cost basis of reimbursement for outpatient hospital based procedures  including cooled thermotherapy  with a new fixed rate or prospective payment system 
under this method of reimbursement  a hospital receives a fixed reimbursement for each cooled thermotherapy treatment performed in its facility  approximately  in calendar year  although the rate varies depending on a wage index and other factors for each hospital 
the urologist performing the cooled thermotherapy treatment receives reimbursement of approximately per procedure 
in january  cms began to reimburse for cooled thermotherapy treatments performed in the urologist s office 
the reimbursement rate inclusive of the physician s fee in calendar year for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office is approximately  compared to  in calendar  which is subject to geographic adjustment 
reimbursement rates for calendar year will be published in the november edition of the federal register 
in july  cms added the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy to the ambulatory surgical centers asc list of medicare approved procedures providing a reimbursement rate for asc 
as a result  procedures performed in an asc were reimbursed under a two part system similar to hospitals the asc received a fixed fee of approximately  the highest amount allowable under this system  while the urologist performing the procedure was reimbursed the same amount as if the treatment occurred in a hospital  approximately the relatively low facility reimbursement relative to the cost of the procedure potentially limited the number of cooled thermotherapy treatments done in an asc 
effective july  the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy was deleted from the asc list of medicare approved procedures 
as a result  effective with that change  urologist who performed cooled thermotherapy procedures in an asc are reimbursed at the office based reimbursement rates  approximately  in calendar year  subject to geographic adjustment 
our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is i educate both patients and physicians on the benefits of cooledthermotherapy compared to other treatment options  ii increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by physicians who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system  iii increase the number of physicians who provide cooled thermotherapy to their patients  iv efficiently provide more physicians with access to cooled thermotherapy through the expansion of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service in the united states  and v increase the use of cooled thermotherapy for the treatment of bph in international markets 

table of contents we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing programs  the expansion of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  and research and development and clinical trials as we focus on growing revenues and continuing to improve our therapy 
in addition  we recently received fda approval for our coolwave control unit which we launched in the first quarter of fiscal our future profitability will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving increased treatment volume and market adoption of the cooled thermotherapy procedures in the physician s office  including treatments delivered through our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the extent to which medicare and other health care payers continue to reimburse costs of cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in physicians offices  hospitals  and ambulatory surgery centers and the amount of reimbursement provided 
in addition  on july  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment 
the adoption of this statement resulted in the company recognizing approximately million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal this expense is reflected as follows for the year ended june  cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative research and development total stock based compensation the decrease in stock based compensation expense compared to the pro forma expense of approximately million in fiscal is due primarily to the reduction in unvested options as of the beginning of fiscal  and to the final vesting of options granted in fiscal and with weighted average fair values of and  respectively  compared to the continuing vesting and expense associated with options granted in fiscal and with lower weighted average fair values of and  respectively 
critical accounting policies in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy system control units upon delivery to the customer 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy system control units with customers under a variety of programs for both evaluation and longer term use  and also provide access to cooled thermotherapy treatments via our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
we retain title to the control units placed with our customers for evaluation and longer term use and do not recognize any revenue on these control units until title has transferred 
these programs  as well as our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  are designed to expand access to our technology  and thus expand the market for our single use treatment catheters 
revenue from our mobile service is recognized upon treatment of the patient 
revenue from the sale of single use treatment catheters is recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue for warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product warranty we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim and other factors 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  single use treatment catheters  and raw materials to produce the control units and treatment catheters  at the lower of cost or market value on the first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes 
table of contents both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
valuation of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill at june   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
as of june   identifiable intangible assets consist of developed technologies  customer base and trademarks of million  million and million  respectively 
developed technologies and customer base are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
the trademark asset  which represents the prostatron and tumt trademarks acquired from edap on october   was considered to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to the approval of the coolwave control unit and our intent to focus marketing on this control unit and trademark  and due to the fact that we are not currently planning to manufacture additional prostatron control units  it was determined that the trademark intangible no longer had an indefinite life and that amortization of the asset should begin 
as a result  we began amortizing the trademark  using the straight line method  at the beginning of the fourth quarter over its remaining estimated useful life of years 
we review identifiable intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative net income for fiscal years  and  and estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded a million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal to determine the amount of the reduction in the valuation allowance  we projected our income over the remaining estimated life of our definite lived intangible assets of approximately nine years 
the amount of the valuation allowance reduction was based on our projected taxable income 
we will continue to assess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if circumstances warrant 
if our actual results and updated projections vary significantly from our projections  we would need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets 
we would adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make the determination 
at june   we carried a valuation allowance of million against our remaining deferred tax assets that we do not expect to reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
stock based compensation on july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation expense on all stock option awards granted subsequent to july   as well as on any existing awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after july  in addition  compensation expense is recognized on the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to july  the amount of compensation expense is based on the fair value of the option award at the date of grant and is recognized over the requisite service period which corresponds to the option vesting period 
options typically vest percent after the first year of service with the remaining vesting th each month thereafter 
generally  options granted to non employee directors are immediately exercisable at the date of grant 
options are priced based on the closing price of a share of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
to determine the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model we use historical data to estimate expected volatility and the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the range of these assumptions and the range of option pricing and number of options granted at the different grant dates will impact our calculation of the fair value of the awards and will therefore impact the amount of expense reflected in our statement of operations for any given period 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the modest sales growth from fiscal to fiscal is attributable to sales from our cooled thermotherapy mobile service which was launched in september this increase was partially offset by a decrease in average per unit selling prices of single use treatment catheters primarily due to increased competition in the office based bph treatment 
sales of our single use treatment catheters and mobile treatments accounted for approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to approximately of revenue in fiscal at june   we had a domestic installed base of cooled thermotherapy systems  including the units that are being used by customers pursuant to our evaluation and longer term use programs and units being used in our company owned mobile service  compared to an installed base of units at june  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  amortization related to developed technologies  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold is primarily the result of an increase in the number of treatment catheters sold  additional costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service that was launched in september  an increase in manufacturing variances as a result of manufacturing challenges incurred in the second half of fiscal  as well as approximately  of equity based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit rates is primarily the result of decreased year over year average per unit selling prices of our single use treatment catheters  lower overall margins on our mobile unit treatments  as well as the fourth quarter manufacturing variances and the equity based compensation expense mentioned above 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is largely the result of million of equity based compensation expense  as well as increased expenses associated with sales and marketing programs designed to increase the awareness of cooled thermotherapy 
research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in expenses is primarily from decreased expenditures on product development activities related to our coolwave control unit 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased to  in fiscal from  fiscal the increase in amortization expense is the result of the determination in the fourth quarter of fiscal to begin amortizing our indefinite lived trademark on a straight line basis over its estimated remaining life of years at april  the decision to begin amortizing our trademark  which represents the prostatron and tumt trademarks acquired from edap on october   was due to the approval of the coolwave control unit and our intent to focus marketing on this control unit and trademark  and due to the fact that we are not currently planning to manufacture additional prostatron control units 
net interest income net interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is due to higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to income tax expense of  in fiscal historically we have carried a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the majority of which represent net operating loss tax carry forwards which we generated prior to achieving profitability 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative net income for fiscal years  and  and estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded a million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal the deferred tax benefit of million was partially offset by  of income tax expense related to state taxes and other deferred tax items 
our fiscal tax rate is expected to exceed 
we will no longer be offsetting regular federal income tax expense against our net operating loss carryforwards as we have in prior years since we have now established a net deferred tax asset and a portion of equity based compensation expense will not provide a tax benefit 
because of our tax situation  our future tax rate will be very sensitive to the amount of pre tax income 
our tax expense will continue to be primarily non cash 

table of contents fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales growth resulted primarily from increased revenues from the sale of our single use treatment catheters in the united states partially offset by a decrease in the number of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold during the period as well as lower revenues internationally 
sales of single use treatment catheters accounted for of revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal average per unit selling prices of our single use treatment catheters increased over fiscal prices primarily due to our price standardization initiative implemented in the second half of fiscal as well as a stronger mix of sales to our direct office accounts 
at june   we had a domestic installed base of cooled thermotherapy systems  including the units that are being used by customers pursuant to our evaluation and longer term use programs  compared to an installed base of units at june  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  and amortization expense related to developed technologies 
cost of goods sold for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in the number of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold during the year  combined with lower per unit manufacturing costs of our single use treatment catheters  as well as a  charge we incurred in fiscal related to a commitment to purchase additional control unit inventory at prices which exceeded the expected future sales value 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the gross profit rate resulted primarily from an increase in the average per unit selling prices of our single use treatment catheters combined with a reduction in their average per unit manufacturing costs 
additionally  fiscal gross profit rates were negatively impacted by the  charge described above 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in expense was due primarily to a reduction in legal expenses related to the patent infringement suit we filed to protect our intellectual property that was settled in january as well as a reduction in corporate overhead and variable selling expenses  partially offset by an increase in expenses related to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in expenses resulted primarily from increased expenditures on product development activities related to our next generation coolwave control unit partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of identifiable intangible assets was  for both fiscal and this amortization expense is related to the acquired customer base that resulted from the purchase of the prostatron cooled thermotherapy product line from edap in october restructuring in may  we announced plans for organizational restructuring that eliminated positions within the company and also resulted in our vacating a portion of our leased facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge to cover the expenses associated with these items 
all of the targeted headcount reductions were completed by june  and we sublet the vacated space beginning in the second quarter of fiscal there were no restructuring amounts in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a  restructuring benefit  which resulted from a reduction in our severance obligations related to the may workforce reduction 
all severance obligations have been paid 
the lease term on the vacated space runs through fiscal net interest income net interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due to higher cash and investment balances  higher interest rates  as well as a reduction in interest expense associated with the lease obligation assumed as part of the prostatron acquisition in october the lease obligation was completed during the third fiscal quarter of provision for income taxes income tax expense increased to  for fiscal from  in the prior year 
the majority of income tax expense represents the increase in the deferred tax liability resulting from the amortization of goodwill and trademarks for tax purposes 
the deferred tax liability related to the indefinite lived intangible assets cannot be offset against deferred tax assets with finite lives 
the increase in income tax expense in fiscal was due to federal alternative minimum taxes and state taxes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million as of june  the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our net earnings and from the exercise of stock options of approximately  cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
our net earnings of million combined with depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation expense of million  were partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets of million  increase in inventories of million  increase in accounts receivable of million  and decreases in accrued expenses and deferred income of  the increase in our deferred tax assets is the result of a partial take down in our valuation allowance of approximately million due to the determination in the fourth quarter of fiscal that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize a partial benefit from deferred tax assets largely related to net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase in inventory is a result of purchases related to the anticipated release of our coolwave product  as well as inventory to support increased production of targis catheters 
a portion of this inventory was transferred to property and equipment in support of our customer evaluation and longer term use programs and to support the expansion of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
the increase in accounts receivable was mainly driven by higher sales volume in june versus june and an increase in our days sales outstanding 
the decrease in accrued expenses and deferred income is the result of previously accrued fiscal employee bonuses and june sales commissions paid in fiscal  as well as decreases in the amount accrued for employee bonuses and sales commissions in fiscal cash provided by investing activities we used  for investing activities as a result of the purchase of  of property and equipment  partially offset by the maturity of  of available for sale investments 
the increase in the purchase of property and equipment is the result of the purchase of approximately  of equipment from three regional mobile service providers in the first quarter of fiscal to facilitate the launch of our own cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
the equipment purchased for the mobile service providers consisted of vans  control units  ultrasounds and monitors and patient monitoring equipment 
the remaining increase in property and equipment is largely the result of additional equipment purchased during fiscal to expand our mobile service offering 
during the last three quarters of fiscal we established nine new mobile routes resulting in mobile service being offered in fourteen select geographies in the united states as of june  cash provided by financing activities during fiscal we generated  from financing activities as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and longer term use of our cooled thermotherapy system control units in addition to purchase options  as well as grow our mobile service which provides physicians and patients with efficient access to our cooled thermotherapy system control units on a pre scheduled basis 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately million of control units used in evaluation or long term use programs and units used in our company owned mobile service 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance these programs 
future contractual commitments  including interest  that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands total building and equipment leases we have no contractual commitments beyond fiscal year based upon our financial performance in fiscal  we believe our million in cash and cash equivalents at june   together with the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital resources needs for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for the company beginning in fiscal year we are still evaluating the impact the adoption of this pronouncement will have on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and was not materially different from the quarter end carrying value 
due to the nature of our cash and cash equivalents  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward commodity contracts since we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
