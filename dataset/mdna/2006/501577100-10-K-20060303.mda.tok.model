executive summary company description 
we are a global medical device company specializing in the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices used to treat and restore spinal anatomy using minimally invasive technology 
our devices are presently used primarily by spine specialists  including orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons  interventional radiologists and interventional neuroradiologists  who repair compression fractures of the spine caused by osteoporosis  trauma  cancer or benign lesions through minimally invasive spine surgeries known as balloon kyphoplasty procedures 
our commercial products consist of our kyphx instruments  which are used to treat spinal fractures during balloon kyphoplasty  including our proprietary kyphx balloon technology  and our proprietary brands of bone filler materials 
most alternative treatments for these types of spinal fractures are either highly invasive or are only pain management therapies 
our corporate headquarters and united states operations are located in sunnyvale  california  where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research and development  regulatory and administrative activities 
outside the united states  we operate a sales  clinical  regulatory and administrative facility in brussels  belgium  a research and biomaterials manufacturing facility in rosbach  germany  a clinical  regulatory and administrative facility in japan  and we have direct selling operations in many of the major countries in europe and in canada 
in november  we leased a facility which serves as a temporary facility for us to conduct administrative and distribution activities for our international business while we build a larger facility in neuch tel  switzerland 
we anticipate the larger facility should be available in  and are currently evaluating financing options for it 
we plan to conduct manufacturing  distribution  administrative and certain research and development activities in this facility to support the growth of our international business 
our global distribution network consists of a direct sales organization in excess of individuals who market our products in the us  many of the major countries in europe and in canada and distributors and sales agents in other countries in which we do not have a direct sales force 
in japan  we are presently focused primarily on procuring the appropriate governmental regulatory clearances and approvals necessary to market and sell our kyphx products  and we recently enrolled our sixth patient in our japanese clinical trial 
products and significant business trends 
our net sales consist of the sales of our kyphx instruments  including our kyphx inflatable bone tamps  kyphx inflation syringe  kyphx bone access systems  kyphx bone filler device  kyphx curettes  kyphx bone biopsy device  kyphx hv r bone cement  kyphx mixer and our ce marked kyphos calcium phosphate from our acquisition of sanatis gmbh sanatis 
during  our business experienced significant growth 
net sales in increased to million  compared to million in  representing growth of 
we trained over  physicians during  primarily in the united states and in europe 
in the us  we added approximately new hospitals to our customer base during in april  we entered into an agreement to exclusively license  in the field of orthopaedics including all spinal applications  dr 
j 
lee berger s portfolio of patents concerning medical devices and methods for creating voids in  or moving  tissue or bone  including platform cannulae for expandable bodies 
we made an up front payment of million in april and have agreed to provide a lifetime capped royalty stream on any products that may be developed that practice the licensed patent rights 
in january  we formed an exclusive consulting relationship with dr 
harvinder sandhu  a well respected orthopaedic surgeon  covering various fields of minimally invasive spine diagnosis and therapy  including treatment of spinal disc disorders and diagnosis of various spine conditions 
in november  dr 
sandhu had previously agreed to exclusively license to kyphon his early invention rights concerning a directional bone tamp for treating vertebral compression fractures for a cash payment of million and a series of payments totaling up to an additional million 
the license also includes a capped royalty stream on any future developed product that practices dr 
sandhu s technology 
on december   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire innospine  inc innospine a privately held company focused on developing and marketing its proprietary technology platform for the diagnosis and potential treatment of axial low back pain due to disc degeneration 
the terms of the acquisition called for an initial purchase price of million in cash to the shareholders of innospine  plus the possibility of up to an additional million in cash or stock  based on achievement of clinical and other milestones as well as royalties on future net sales 
we recorded million to developed technology as a result of this acquistion which we expect to amortize on a straight line basis over the next years 
we intend to initiate full commercial launch of the innospine product during the second quarter of we expect that sales of the innospine product will largely offset the associated impact of increased operating expenses 
with our acquisition of innospine  we have moved beyond only our original sole focus of spinal deformity correction  through treatment of vertebral compression fractures  to our second business focus  disc repair and regeneration 
we have a variety of internal resources dedicated to supporting research and development in this area as well as potential business development opportunities 
our third business focus  cancer therapy aimed at addressing the actual cancerous conditions that affect the spine rather than merely the effects of those cancerous conditions  such as vertebral compression fractures  remains an area of interest for us and we continue to investigate how and when best to enter that initiative 
we believe both additional business initiatives provide further opportunity to grow our company in the area of minimally invasive spinal diagnosis and therapies 
we will continue to evaluate other additional potential opportunities for growth in our business by evaluating external products and technologies 
while our primary focus will remain on our core business and the opportunities the osteoporosis  cancer and trauma vertebral fracture markets present  we may choose to pursue one or more business development opportunities which we believe are appropriate initiatives for our business  even if such opportunities are outside of the field for the treatment of spinal fractures or disease  or outside of the spine itself 
some of the opportunities we are presently investigating include technologies and products that address degenerative disc disease 
these efforts may require us to seek additional funding and may be dilutive to our earnings 
and until such time  if ever  that kyphon succeeds in diversifying its business through internal development or external business development activities  kyphon will remain dependent on the single opportunity of treating vertebral compression fractures with balloon kyphoplasty with its products and bear the traditional risks to its business of being a company whose revenues are principally derived from one procedure

taylor as coo 
the company intends to promptly begin a search to fill the roles of vice president  research and development  and vice president and cfo 
over the past year  a handful of vocal physicians have begun to publicly criticize the cost and merits of balloon kyphoplasty as a procedure for treating vertebral compression fractures 
we believe this is due  in part  to the absence to date of prospective  randomized  controlled clinical trial data to justify the effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty and the perceived economic differentiation between balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty 
on more than one occasion  certain speakers  including a few physicians of authority in various institutions and professional societies  have publicly stated their opposition to both balloon kyphoplasty and kyphon based on a lack of perceived justification for the cost or economics of the procedure 
while we are in the process of conducting a randomized  controlled trial in europe comparing balloon kyphoplasty versus non surgical management  enrollment of which recently concluded  we do not yet know what clinical outcomes that trial will reveal  or whether the trial s results  once available  will be beneficial to making a case for treatment of vertebral compression fractures with balloon kyphoplasty  or how this public negative criticism to adoption of our products for treating patients ultimately may affect our business or our revenues 
the status of our significant current clinical trials follows we co mpleted enrollment of patients in the fracture reduction evaluation study  a prospective  randomized  controlled multi center trial designed to compare balloon kyphoplasty to non surgical management in the treatment of painful  acute vertebral compression fractures 
we secured approval from the japanese ministry of health to begin our clinical trial in the third quarter of our japanese trial is a single arm study that will enroll a total of patients with spinal fractures and follow them for years 
patient enrollment is presently expected to conclude in data from this trial  in addition to clinical data obtained from studies previously completed in the us and europe  will be used to support regulatory approval in japan for balloon kyphoplasty 
if approved  we could begin commercialization in japan in the timeframe 
in we also initiated patient enrollment for our cancer patient fracture evaluation study as well as the pulmonary function pilot study 
both studies are in the early stages of patient enrollment 
we will be initiating a randomized controlled trial comparing balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty 
this trial will consider several important study endpoints including perioperative safety  function  quality of life  vertebral body height restoration  rate of subsequent fractures and angular deformity correction 
it will also include an economic and healthcare utilization analysis 
this trial is designed to enroll approximately  patients  with enrollment beginning in the fourth quarter of at up to sites with two year follow up 
substantial portions of our pre clinical studies and all of our clinical trials are performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the level of patient enrollment and amount of work completed on each study 
the difficulty in predicting the timing of patient enrollment can create volatility in our expenses 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearances and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive government regulation  including the united states food and drug administration fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business and our financial condition  which could cause our stock price to decline 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in the factors affecting future operating results section below 
critical accounting policies and estimates all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial policies and estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
those financial policies and estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of our products to customers and distributors 
revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor 
allowances are established for product returns and discounts based upon historical trends and are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
accounts receivable allowances 
we make estimates on the collectibility of customer accounts based primarily on analysis of historical trends and experience and changes in customers financial condition 
management uses its best judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a reserve against the amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
our accounts receivable allowances have been less than of net sales for each of the years ended december   and our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to increase the provision needed for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories was  and  at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled at their carrying value  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  we released our valuation allowance because based upon our recurring level of profitability  we believed that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
prior to the fourth quarter of we had provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes 
this process involves determining our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on objective positive evidences and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
as of december  and  we have recorded no valuation allowance  based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
purchase accounting 
purchase accounting requires extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price between in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets  and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
to assist in determining the value of any in process research and development and certain other intangibles  a third party valuation is typically obtained as of the acquisition date 
purchased in process research and development is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased in process research and development and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with standard valuation methods 
for purchased in process research and development  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
goodwill and impairment of long lived assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the annual goodwill impairment test for our sanatis acquisition was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  and it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances subsequent to our annual test which may indicate the asset is impaired 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
stock option valuation 
the current preparation of the financial statements requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value of our employee stock options 
as of january   using the modified prospective method  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  which requires the expensing of our stock compensation programs 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to increase our cost of goods sold and operating expenses by approximately million in based upon employee stock options outstanding as of december  and estimated option grants to employees 
had we been required to expense employee stock options in  our cost of goods sold and operating expenses would have increased by approximately million 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of of amount net sales amo unt net sales amount net sales us net sales  international net sales  net sales  cost of goods sold  gross profit  operating expenses research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  total operating expenses  income from operations  interest income and other  net  income before income taxes  provision benefit for income taxes  net income  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  in compared to  and increased million  or  in compared to the increases in net sales in primarily resulted from an increase in the number of physicians trained in the use of our kyphx instruments as well as an increase in the number of procedures performed by trained physicians per month compared to during approximately  physicians were trained in the use of our kyphx instruments 
the increases in net sales in primarily resulted from the  more physicians trained in the use of our kyphx instruments during as well as a increase in the number of procedures performed by trained physicians per month compared to domestic sales increased million  or in compared to and million  or in compared to international sales increased million  or in compared to and million  or in compared to international sales also reflected the unfavorable currency impact of million in and a favorable currency impact of million in based on prior year s average euro rates 
no customer accounted for more than of total net sales in  or as of december   we had trained approximately  spine specialists in the us and approximately  clinicians in other parts of the world  primarily europe 
these physicians have used our kyphx instruments in approximately  patients and  spinal fractures worldwide 
we believe the total number of potential physicians who may perform balloon kyphoplasty procedures using our products is approximately  in the us internationally  the number of physicians who may perform balloon kyphoplasty is not as well defined  but we believe it to be more than  we have targeted a range of million to million in net sales for cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of material  labor  subcontract  and overhead costs 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  in compared to  and increased million  or  in compared to the absolute increase in cost of goods sold over the years from to resulted primarily from increased material  labor  subcontract and overhead costs in relation to the increased sales volume of our products in addition to an increase in our inventory provisions in fiscal and due to planned new generation product transition 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased from to primarily as a result of fixed overhead costs being spread over increased production volume 
our cost of goods sold and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
as a percentage of net sales  we expect cost of goods sold to be in the range of to for research and development 
research and development expenses consist of costs for product research  product development  clinical functions and outside costs related to clinical trials and personnel 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from was primarily attributable to the license acquisition charges of million to dr 
harvinder sandhu and million to dr 
lee berger 
the remaining increase of million was attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased clinical studies expense of million  increased engineering and lab expenses of  increased travel expenses of  and increased facilities costs of  offset by a decreased research and development consulting fees of million and decreased educational grants of  the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased clinical studies expense of million  increased research and development consulting fees of  and increased facilities costs of  offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of million 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses in will increase in absolute dollars excluding the license acquisition charges due largely to the commencement of clinical studies 
we anticipate conducting significant additional clinical trial activity both in the united states and abroad to collect further data that may support the use and clinical efficacy of our products 
as a percentage of net sales  we anticipate our research and development expenses to be in the range of to for sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of costs for personnel  physician training programs and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in compared to sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from related primarily to a million increase in the costs of hiring  training and compensating additional direct selling representatives  increased advertising  trade shows  educational and promotional activity expenses of million  increased sales and marketing travel expenses of million  increased facilities expenses of million and increased educational grants of million 
the increase in from related primarily to a million increase in the costs of hiring  training and compensating additional direct selling representatives and expansion of the spine education specialist ses sales force  increased sales travel expenses of million  increased expenditures for surgeon training and professional education of million and increased outside professional service fees and consulting expenses of million 
in  we largely completed the consolidation of the ses sales force with the rest of the sales force 
as we continue to commercialize our kyphx instruments on a global basis  we expect to significantly increase our sales and marketing efforts and expenditures in absolute dollars while maintaining our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales at to for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of costs for personnel  professional service fees  expenses related to intellectual property rights  sarbanes oxley compliance and general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased consulting and outside professional service fees of million  increased personnel costs of million  and increased litigation costs of million 
the increase in from was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased litigation costs of million and increased consulting and outside professional service fees of million 
the increases in expenses were offset partially by decreased amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we add personnel  continue to expand our patent portfolio and incur additional public reporting  governmental compliance and investor related expenses as a public company  and incur start up costs for our new facility in switzerland 
therefore  we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our infrastructure 
as a percentage of net sales  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will be approximately to in interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  increased million in compared to interest income and other  net  increased  in compared to the increase in compared to  and the increase in compared to resulted primarily from an increase in interest income due to higher cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  as well as higher interest rates 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments balances were million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was million at an effective tax rate of for the year 
the provision for income taxes in was million at an effective tax rate of for the year 
the lower effective tax rate for is primarily due to a one time tax benefit related to revised estimates of our research and development credits and to manufacturing deductions 
the benefit for income taxes of million in resulted primarily from the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of we believe that in our effective tax rate will be approximately of income before taxes  with the actual amount of taxes paid potentially reduced by the utilization of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards as well as deductions due to stock option activities 
at december   we had approximately  and million in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce future taxable income 
the federal and state carryforwards have expiration dates beginning in and  respectively  in each case if not utilized 
at december   we had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in the state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
ownership changes for the company  as defined  occurred on august   december  and may  in addition  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire innospine on december  ownership changes for innospine as defined  occurred on march  and december  in accordance with internal revenue code section  utilization of the carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
the annual limitation is not expected to result in the expiration of net operating losses prior to utilization 
stock based compensation we recorded deferred stock based compensation on options issued prior to our initial public offering as the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of grant 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized to cost of goods sold  research and development expense  sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense as the options vest  generally over four years 
deferred stock based compensation for employee stock options recorded through december  was million  with accumulated amortization of million 
the remaining amount will be fully amortized by may all option amounts are being amortized using the straight line method 
stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to non employees is recognized as the stock options are earned 
the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
in connection with the grant of stock options to non employees  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million   and million in  and  respectively 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature 
historically  demand for our products has been the highest in the first and second quarters in the us and in the second and fourth quarters in europe 
in the us  during the fourth quarter  our net sales generally reflect the reduced number of selling days due to the holiday season 
in europe  we traditionally experience somewhat lower sales volumes in the third quarter months than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european summer holiday schedule 
in addition  the fourth quarter in europe is typically favorably impacted by our customers budget utilization and our distributors fulfillment of their annual purchase commitments 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments  and working capital of million 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments increased by million during cash provided by operating activities 
our operating cash flow in was primarily the result of our operational profitability 
net cash provided by operations was million attributable primarily to net income of million and adjustments for non cash charges related to the provision for deferred taxes including tax benefits from stock options of million 
net cash provided by operations in was million in attributable primarily to net income of million and adjustments for non cash charges related to the provision for deferred taxes including tax benefits from stock options of million 
net cash provided by operations in was million primarily attributable to net income of million and offset by the net release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million 
the increases in cash provided by operating activities for all periods was adjusted by changes in our working capital  primarily in accounts receivable  inventories and accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable increased by million  million and million during   and  respectively  due to increases in our net sales 
inventories decreased by  in due to improved inventory management 
inventories increased by million and million during and  respectively  to meet the increased demand for our products 
accrued liabilities increased by million  million  and million during   and  respectively  due to our increased operating expenses and income taxes 
in accrued liabilities included million relating to the license acquisition charge from our agreement with dr 
sandhu 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment for all periods 
during  cash used for investing activities reflected the net purchases of investments of million  and payment of million in connection with the acquisition of innospine 
during  cash used in investing activities reflected the net purchases of investments of million 
during  cash used in investing activities reflected the net purchases of investments of million  and payment of million in connection with the sanatis acquisition 
we expect our purchases of property and equipment in to increase due to the expansion of our sunnyvale facility and the establishment of our new manufacturing  distribution and research and development facilities in switzerland 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided during was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million and the exercise of stock options of million 
cash provided during was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million and the exercise of stock options of million 
cash provided during was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million  exercise of stock options of million and repayment of related party notes receivable of million 
contractual cash obligations 
at december  we had contractual cash obligations as follows in thousands payment due by periods total after operating leases    consulting agreement license agreement    purchase commitments with contract manufactures and suppliers   purchase obligations   asset retirement obligation total commitments    the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent aggregate future minimum lease payments under non cancellable facility leases 
portions of these payments and a portion of the asset retirement obligations are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the tables above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are obligated to make a series of annual payments totaling up to million related to the license acquisition agreement with dr 
sandhu 
the payments of these additional obligations may be accelerated upon defined events and circumstances or may be forgiven upon the occurrence of a third party event  outside the control of the company 
based on management judgment  ability and intent  this amount has been classified as current liability as of december  on december   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire innospine  inc a privately held company focused on developing and marketing its proprietary technology platform for the diagnosis and potential treatment of axial low back pain due to disc degeneration 
the terms of the acquisition called for an initial purchase price of million in cash to the shareholders of innospine  plus the possibility of up to an additional million in cash or stock  based on achievement of clinical and other milestones as well as royalties on future net sales 
this contingent purchase price liability is not included in the table above 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and to help assure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  noncancelable  and unconditional commitments 
the purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be fulfilled within one year 
purchase obligations 
purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  other than commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers  for which we have not received the goods or services 
although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing as of december  all of our subsidiaries are included in the financial statements  and we do not have relationships with any special purpose entities 
stock repurchase 
our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program on november   pursuant to which we may purchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
the duration of the repurchase program is open ended 
under the program  we may purchase shares of common stock through open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management and the board of directors 
the purchases will be funded from available working capital 
in  we repurchased  shares pursuant to this repurchase program 
we have not repurchased any of our common stock since summary 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we anticipate conducting significant additional clinical trial activity both in the united states and abroad to collect further data that may support the use and clinical efficacy of our products 
the costs of these trials will be significant 
if existing cash  cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  whether as a result of investment in new markets or businesses through both internal or external business development  expansion of product lines  additional clinical trials  possible increased capital expenditures  or for other reasons related to our business  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock  and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate certain of our business expansion activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of our investments to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing rate rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  investments are generally held to maturity and the weighted average duration of our investments is months or less 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
we have operated mainly in the united states  and   and of our sales were made in us dollars in   and  respectively 
the majority of our non us sales are derived from european union countries and denominated in the euro 
monthly income and expense from our european operations are translated using average rates and balance sheets are translated using month end rates 
differences are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or to the income statement  as applicable 
as our revenues denominated in currencies other than the dollar increase  we have an increased exposure to foreign currency rate risk 
based on our overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our net sales and operating expenses 
we may elect to mitigate this rate risk  in part or in whole  through the purchase of forward currency contracts
