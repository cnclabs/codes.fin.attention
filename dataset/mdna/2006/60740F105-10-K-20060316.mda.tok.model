item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a  risk factors 
overview general in  we initiated a strategy of focusing on leasing rather than selling our portable storage units 
as a result of this change  leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased steadily from in to in the number of portable storage and combination storage office and mobile office units in our lease fleet increased from  at the end of to  at the end of  representing a compounded annual growth rate  or cagr  of 
we derive most of our revenues from the leasing of portable storage containers and portable offices 
the average contracted lease term at lease inception is approximately months for portable storage units and approximately months for portable offices 
after the expiration of the contracted lease term  units continue on lease on a month to month basis 
in  the over all lease term averaged months for portable storage units and months for portable offices 
as a result of these long average lease terms  our leasing business tends to provide us with a recurring revenue stream and minimizes fluctuations in revenues 
however  there is no assurance that we will maintain such lengthy overall lease terms 
in addition to our leasing business  we also sell portable storage containers and occasionally we sell portable office units 
since  when we changed our focus to leasing  our sales revenues as a percentage of total revenues have decreased from in to in over the last eight years  mobile mini has grown both through internally generated growth and acquisitions which we use to gain a presence in new markets 
typically  we enter a new market through the acquisition of the business of a smaller local competitor and then apply our business model  which is usually much more customer service and marketing focused than the business we are buying or its competitors in the market 
if we cannot find a desirable acquisition opportunity in a market we wish to enter  we establish a new location from the ground up 
as a result  a new branch location will typically have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as our marketing efforts help us penetrate the new market and we increase the number of units on rent at the new branch  we take advantage of operating efficiencies to improve operating margins at the branch and typically reach company average levels after several years 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing an infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum staffing levels and certain minimum levels of delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we generate high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit rented in excess of the break even level  contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  additional fixed expenses that we incur require us to achieve additional revenue as compared to the prior period to cover the additional expense 
over the past three years  we have not entered into as many new markets as we had in the preceding years  resulting in less downward pressure on our operating margins 
among the external factors we examine to determine the direction of our business is the level of non residential construction activity  especially in areas of the country where we have a significant presence 
customers in the construction industry represented approximately of our units on rent at december   and because of the degree of operating leverage we have  increases or declines in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
in and  we saw weakness in the level of leasing revenues from the non residential construction sector of our customer base 
the lower than historical growth rate in revenues combined with increases in fixed costs depressed our growth in adjusted ebitda as defined below in those years 
in and  the level of non residential construction activity in the us leveled off and rose after two years of steep declines 
as a result of the improvement in the non residential construction sector and the general improvements in the economy  our adjusted ebitda increased in both and in managing our business  we focus on our internal growth rate in leasing revenue  which we define as growth in lease revenues on a year over year basis at our branch locations in operation for at least one year  without inclusion of leasing revenue attributed to same market acquisitions 
this internal growth rate has remained positive every quarter  but in and had fallen to single digits  from over prior to  due to the slowdown in the economy  especially as the slowdown affected the non residential 
table of contents construction sector in certain areas where we have large branch operations  including texas and colorado 
we achieved an internal growth rate in of  reflecting a vast improvement in both economic and market conditions 
mobile mini s goal is to maintain a high internal growth rate so that revenue growth will exceed inflationary growth in expenses and we can continue to take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  debt restructuring costs  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into on an irregular basis based on capital needs and market opportunities  and this measure provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to ignore the effect of what we consider non recurring events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as adjusted ebitda 
the non recurring events reflected in the adjusted ebitda are the effect in and in of our florida litigation expense  which was concluded in  and  in  the losses incurred related to hurricane katrina and the proceeds received from a third party related to a settlement agreement in connection with the florida litigation 
because ebitda is a non gaap financial measure  as defined by the sec  we include in this report reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these reconciliations are included in item  selected financial data 
in managing our business  we routinely compare our adjusted ebitda margins from year to year and based upon age of branch 
we define this margin as adjusted ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the startup costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our high operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage  combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  refurbish and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include among other expenses  advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
the steel units in our lease fleet other than van trailers are depreciated on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
see item business product lives and durability 
our expansion program and other factors can affect our overall utilization rate 
during the last five years  our annual utilization levels averaged  and ranged from a low of in to a high of in the lower utilization rate in was primarily a result of i the fact that many of our acquisitions have had utilization levels lower than our average rates  especially after we have added our proprietary product to the existing product mix  and ii the economic slowdown during and in the general 
table of contents economy and in particular the slowdown in the construction sector 
during and through  we saw a steady recovery in the overall economy and an improvement in the construction sector  which accounted for approximately to of our leased units in and  respectively 
as the general economy and the non residential construction industry in our markets continued to recover  we repositioned some of our lease fleet units among our branch locations to meet growing demand 
our utilization levels increased throughout the year and averaged during since  we have increased our total lease fleet from  units to  units  representing a cagr of 
our utilization is somewhat seasonal with the low realized in the first quarter and the high realized in the fourth quarter 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of income  certain amounts may not add due to rounding year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses florida litigation expense depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense other income interest expense debt restructuring expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing of portable storage units and portable offices accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the average rental yield per unit and a increase in the average number of units on lease 
in  our internal growth rate increased to approximately as compared to approximately in we define internal growth as the growth in lease revenues on a year over year basis at our branch locations in operation for at least one year  without inclusion of leasing revenue attributed to same market acquisitions 
during  we saw a steady improvement in our internal growth rate from the previous year s level 
the internal growth rate peaked during the first quarter of  but remained strong throughout the year 
the internal growth rate during the four quarters of was   and  respectively 
we opened three new branches as start ups in minneapolis  minnesota  indianapolis  indiana  and pensacola  florida 
we also completed one acquisition in  and we consolidated the acquired business operations into our existing columbus  ohio branch 
sales of portable storage units have accounted for and in and  respectively  of our total revenues 
other revenues  primarily related to our sales business and principally arising from transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units decreased million  or  to million in from million in our leasing business continues to be our primary focus and has become an increasing part of our revenue mix over the past several years 
as a percentage of total revenues  leasing revenues represented in compared to in 
table of contents cost of sales is the cost to us of units we sold during the period 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenues decreased to in from in our gross margin increased slightly in as compared to  but it was at high levels during both periods 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
included in this expense is approximately million of losses relating to physical damage of assets as a result of hurricane katrina 
this amount represents our estimate of damages we sustained based on our current assessment  primarily at our new orleans  louisiana  branch and to units on lease at customer locations 
this estimate is net of certain limited insurance reimbursements that we have already received under our insurance policies 
excluding the hurricane katrina related expense  our leasing  selling and general expenses would have increased by million  or 
as some of the new markets we entered in the past few years continue to mature  and as their revenues increase to cover our fixed expenses  those markets begin to contribute to our high margins on incremental lease revenues 
each additional unit on lease in excess of the break even level contributes significantly to profitability 
these economies of scale were offset to some extent by increases in certain expense levels 
payroll and related expenses increased by million and included the increase in commissions we pay our sales personnel related to the increase in revenues of million and general increases for  employees to support the growth of our leasing activities 
freight trucking expense increased by million as we used more third party vendors for the transportation of our units  particularly our modular office units which are more expensive to transport  and due to the repositioning of some of our lease fleet units from city to city 
we repositioned units to meet our customers demand by more efficiently using our existing resources  which also resulted in higher overall utilization rates 
repairs on our lease fleet increased by million due to our increased maintenance efforts which were related to the increase in our overall utilization rates 
fuel expenses increased by million due to fuel price increases and the increase in the number of deliveries and pick ups due to our larger fleet size and customer base 
repairs and maintenance of equipment increased by million principally as a result of our preventative maintenance programs and general repairs associated with servicing a larger lease fleet 
insurance expense increased by million for our policies related to our business and employees 
ebitda increased million  or  to million in from million in ebitda in includes the hurricane katrina related expense of million and the net proceeds of million from a third party settlement 
adjusted ebitda  which excludes both the hurricane katrina expense and the proceeds from the settlement agreement  increased by million  or  to million 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation was directly related to a larger fleet in  which enabled us to achieve higher lease revenues 
it includes the depreciation expenses associated with the refurbishment of portable storage units added to the lease fleet during and the inclusion in the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
by increasing our overall utilization rate  we were able to grow revenues faster than we increased the size of our lease fleet 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased by million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates within this item other income represents net proceeds of a settlement agreement pursuant to which a third party reimbursed us for a portion of losses sustained in two lawsuits that arose in connection with the acquisition in april of a portable storage business in florida 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our monthly weighted average debt outstanding during  compared to  increased by  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund part of the growth of our lease fleet during the year 
the remainder of the growth of our lease fleet was funded by operating cash flow 
the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for compared to for  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was in and in our weighted average interest rate is slightly higher in primarily due to higher libor rates in effect during  partially offset by lower spreads from libor on our line of credit due to improved leverage ratio 
in addition  our weighted average interest rate is reduced as a larger percentage of our borrowing comes from our lower rate revolving line of credit 
interest costs include our senior notes that bear interest at per annum  which is higher than the average borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility 
the issuance of the senior notes provided the company with additional liquidity in see liquidity and capital resources within this item provision for income taxes was an effective tax rate of for and for while our blended federal and state tax rate approximates in  our effective rate was higher in due to higher expected state income taxes relating to possible losses of a portion of our state loss carryforwards 
during  our effective tax rate was lower due to a favorable change in our estimate of state tax losses and a partial reversal of the previous allowance established 

table of contents at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
net income in was million  as compared to million in in  net income included an after tax charge of approximately million related to hurricane katrina expense and after tax income of approximately million related to the above mentioned settlement agreement 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing of portable storage units and portable offices accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the average rental yield per unit and a increase in the average number of units on lease 
in  our internal growth rate increased to approximately as compared to approximately in we define internal growth as the growth in lease revenues in markets opened for at least one year  excluding any growth arising as a result of additional acquisitions in those markets 
the level of our internal growth rate in was principally due to general us domestic economic weakness  particularly associated with the non residential construction sector and particularly in several of our more established markets 
internal growth at many of our newer locations was strong during during  we saw a steady improvement in our internal growth rate from the previous year s level 
the internal growth rate during the four quarters of was   and  respectively 
we completed only one small acquisition in detroit  michigan in sales of portable storage units have accounted for and in and  respectively  of our total revenues  and we generated less than of our total revenues from other miscellaneous revenues  primarily related to our sales business and principally arising from transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase in sales revenue was due to an increase in both the price of steel and used steel containers  which we were able to pass on to customers who purchased our units  resulting in a higher price per unit sold 
this price increase was almost completely offset by a lower volume of units sold  as the higher sales prices made it more attractive for customers to lease rather than buy containers 
cost of sales is the cost to us of units we sold during the period 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenues decreased to in from in the higher profit margins in primarily related to our economies of scale associated with our higher number of units produced in resulting in lower manufacturing costs  partially offset by the increase in steel prices 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined due to the operating leverage in the company s business model 
as units on rent are added to existing branches  the growth in revenues far exceeds the growth in leasing  selling and general expenses related to the incremental lease revenue 
these economies of scale were offset to some extent by increases in certain expense levels 
freight trucking expense increased by million as we used more third party vendors for the transportation of our units  particularly our modular office units which are more expensive to transport  and due to the repositioning of some of our lease fleet units from city to city 
we repositioned units to meet our customers demand by more efficiently using our existing resources  which also resulted in higher overall utilization rates 
repairs on our lease fleet increased by million due to our increased maintenance efforts which were related to the increase in our overall utilization rates 
fuel expenses increased by million due to fuel price increases and the increase in the number of deliveries and pick ups due to our larger fleet size and customer base 
repairs and maintenance of equipment increased by million principally as a result of our preventative maintenance programs and general repairs associated with servicing a larger lease fleet 
real estate rent expense increased by million for the lease properties obtained in our two acquisitions in and  new properties and lease renewals at certain of our branch locations and the general inflationary index clauses in our lease agreements 
florida litigation expense in relates to litigation and related costs incurred in connection with litigation which was concluded in ebitda in was million 
in  ebitda was million  which included the effect of million of florida litigation expense 
ebitda increased in by  adjusted ebitda increased in by approximately 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation was directly related to a larger fleet in  which enabled us to achieve higher lease revenues  includes the depreciation expenses associated with the refurbishment of portable storage units added to the lease fleet during and the inclusion in the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
by increasing our overall utilization rate  we were able to grow revenues faster than we increased the size of our lease fleet 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased by million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our average debt outstanding during  compared to  increased by  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund the growth of our lease fleet during the year 
the increase in interest expense includes the higher interest cost associated with our senior notes  which effectively increased the weighted average interest rate on our debt to for from for  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in our weighted average interest rate is higher in due to the full year effect of the higher interest rate on the senior notes  which were issued at the end of june our senior notes bear interest at per annum  which is higher than the average borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility 
on an annualized basis  the additional interest cost incurred under the senior notes versus the senior secured credit facility  which was our sole source of borrowing prior to our issuance of the senior notes  was approximately million based on floating rates and swap rates in effect at the time the transaction was concluded 
however  the issuance of the senior notes in provided the company a great deal of additional liquidity 
see liquidity and capital resources within this item debt restructuring expense in was million and includes the termination expenses approximately million related to unwinding certain interest rate swap agreements relating to debt repaid with the proceeds from our sale during june of million of senior notes and the write off of certain capitalized debt issuance costs approximately million associated with our revolving credit agreement before it was amended and restated in june provision for income taxes was an annual effective tax rate of for and for the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to higher expected state income taxes relating to possible losses of a portion of our state loss carryforwards 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforward in the various states in which we operate 
net income in was million  as compared to million in in  net income included after tax charges of million related to florida litigation expense and after tax charges of million related to debt restructuring expense 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary over the past several years  we have financed an increasing portion of our capital needs  most of which are discretionary and are used principally to acquire additional units for the lease fleet  through working capital and funds generated from operations 
leasing is a capital intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets which we lease have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products we offer 
during recent years our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre tax earnings  particularly due to the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation that is used for tax accounting 
during the past two years  the portion of our capital expenditures not funded by operating cash flow has been funded primarily through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating cash flow is  in general  weakest during the first quarter of each fiscal year  when customers who leased containers for holiday storage return the units 
at december   we had unused borrowing availability of approximately million under our then existing million revolving credit facility 
our net borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility increased by million  from million at december   to million at december  the additional borrowings were used in conjunction with cash provided by operating activities to fund the million increase in our lease fleet during the year ended december  
table of contents at the end of december   we had a million senior secured revolving line of credit with a group of lenders that was scheduled to mature in february on february   we modified the credit agreement by entering into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement with lenders that provides a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to mature in february we may also  at our option and without lenders consent  increase available borrowings under the credit facility by an additional million during the term of the agreement 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in compared to million in and million in the million increase in over in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to our increased net income and the deferral of the income taxes related to that income 
in addition  operating cashflow was enhanced by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in accounts receivables and in inventory primarily raw materials and supplies and units held for sale or refurbishment 
cash generated by operations in was negatively impacted by the payment of million florida litigation judgment 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which minimizes our tax payments at this time 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  million of cash was paid for acquisition of a business  compared to million in period and million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  were million for  million for and million in capital expenditures increased during due to an increase in demand which required us to purchase and refurbish more containers and offices than in and due to an increase in the cost of used shipping containers and modular offices  as well as the price of raw materials  especially steel 
during the past several years we have increased the customization of our fleet  enabling us to differentiate our product from our competitors product  and we have complimented our lease fleet by adding wood mobile offices 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from sale of property  plant and equipment  were million in  million in and million in the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
mobile mini has no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
maintenance capital expenditures is the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for enhancements to our computer information systems 
our maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in during  we primarily relied on cash provided by operations as well as our credit facility to provide the additional cash needed to fund the growth of our lease fleet 
additionally  we received million  million and million from the exercises of employee stock options and the related tax benefits in  and  respectively 
in  we received approximately million in net proceeds from a settlement agreement and in  we funded the florida litigation judgment of approximately million 
in  mobile mini completed an offering of million of senior notes due the net proceeds of the senior notes offering were used in part to unwind certain interest rate swap agreements approximately million that had been entered into to hedge floating rate indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility prior to the transaction  and the remainder of the net proceeds was used to repay borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under the facility 
as of march   our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility were approximately million 
this increase is primarily due to the semi annual interest payment of million under the senior notes in january and obligations that were due during the first quarter of as well as the amendment to our credit facility which increased our available borrowing capacity 
the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  debt restructuring expenses 
the interest rate  as calculated at december  under the million credit facility was  at our election  either the libor london interbank offered rate rate plus or the prime rate  subject to certain conditions 
on february   we amended our million revolving credit facility through a modification of the credit facility which  among other things  increased the amount of the facility to million 
the initial borrowing rate under the modified credit facility is libor plus per annum or the prime rate less per annum  whichever we elect 
loans under the modified million revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate based  at our option and subject to our leverage ratio  on either the prime rate plus a spread ranging from negative to  or libor  plus a spread ranging from 
table of contents to 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly or  with respect to libor borrowings  either quarterly or on the last day of the applicable interest period whichever is more frequent 
in addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal amount  we pay an unused revolving credit facility fee to the senior lenders equal to a range of to per annum on the unused daily balance of the revolving credit commitment  payable monthly in arrears  based upon the actual number of days elapsed in a day year 
for each letter of credit we issue  we pay i a per annum fee equal to the margin over the libor rate from time to time in effect  ii a fronting fee on the aggregate outstanding stated amounts of such letters of credit  plus iii customary administrative charges 
all of our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility and the related guarantees are secured by substantially all of our assets and all assets of each guarantor  including but not limited to i a first priority pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock or other ownership interest owned by us and each guarantor and ii first priority security interests in all of our tangible and intangible assets and the tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor in each case  other than certain equipment assets subject to capitalized lease obligations 
as of december   we had no capital lease obligations 
our million credit agreement imposes some material covenants that restrict us in the conduct of our business  as long as we are not in default under the agreement and we maintain borrowing availability in excess of certain pre determined levels generally between million and million 
if our borrowing availability is below a specified level  the credit facility triggers covenants restricting or in some cases  further restricting our ability to  among other things i declare cash dividends  or redeem or repurchase our capital stock in excess of million  ii prepay  redeem or purchase other debt  iii incur liens  iv make loans and investments  v incur additional indebtedness  vi amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements  vii make capital expenditures  viii engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  ix transact with affiliates  and x alter the business we conduct 
we also must comply with specified financial covenants and affirmative covenants 
should we fall below specified borrowing availability levels  then these financial covenants would set maximum permitted values for our leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and our minimum required utilization rates 
on february   the effective date of our million credit facility  we had approximately million of additional borrowing availability 
our compliance with financial covenants is measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement in place at year end  we were in compliance with all the covenants at december  events of default under the million revolving credit facility include  but are not limited to  i our failure to timely pay principal or interest under the facility when due  ii our material breach of any representations or warranty  iii covenant defaults  iv events of bankruptcy  v cross default under certain other debt instruments  vi certain unsatisfied final judgments over a stated threshold amount  and vii a change of control 
prior to june  we entered into interest rate swap agreements under which we effectively fixed the interest rate payable on million of borrowings under our credit facility so that the rate is based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
in june  in conjunction with our sale of our senior notes and the amendment of our credit facility  we terminated million of these swap agreements 
accounting for these swap agreements is covered by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 and pursuant to sfas no 
 the swap termination resulted in a charge to net income of approximately million  net of an income tax benefit of approximately million at june  at december  and  we had one interest rate swap agreement for million of debt 
in january  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement for an additional million of debt 
at december   a majority of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates or the rate is effectively fixed due to a swap agreement  and approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility are variable rate 
mobile mini believes that it has sufficient borrowings available under the million credit facility to provide for its foreseeable capital needs over the next to months  with the duration dependent in large part upon the balance between the internal growth rates achieved during and subsequent periods and the expenses of entry into additional markets during the period  which will be the main determinant of how quickly the company uses its additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our secured revolving credit facility and million of unsecured senior notes  together with other notes payable obligations both secured and unsecured 
we also have operating lease commitments for real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms on our major leased properties ranging from one to ten years  delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price  and other equipment  primarily office machines 
in connection with the issuance of our insurance policies  we have provided our various insurance carriers approximately million in letters of credit and an agreement under which we are contingently responsible for million to provide credit support for our payment of the deductibles and or loss limitation reimbursements under the insurance policies

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this causes lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the year 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
mobile mini s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage units and office units are recognized monthly on a straight line basis 
revenues and expenses from portable storage unit delivery and hauling are recognized when these services are billed  in accordance with sab no 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers and mobile office units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company sells its products pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price with its customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts agings 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share at december  as follows years ended december  in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for hypothetical change in reserve estimates net income diluted earnings per share if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
we operate in one reportable segment  which is comprised of one reporting unit and pursuant to sfas no 
 all of our goodwill has been assigned to the enterprise as a whole 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we performed the annual required impairment tests for goodwill at december   december  and december   and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired as of those dates 
we will continue to perform this test in the future as required by sfas no 
impairment long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
in  our depreciation policy on our steel units was modified to increase the useful life to years from years  and to decrease the residual value to from  which effectively resulted in continued depreciation on steel units for five additional years at the same annual rate 
this change was made to reflect that some of our steel units have now been in our lease fleet longer than years and these units continue to be effective income producing assets that do not show signs of reaching the end of their useful life 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data that shows we have been able to retain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of the unit in our container lease fleet 

table of contents we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect being determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life on our steel units would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share as reflected in the table below 
useful residual life in value years in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance is purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we provide for the estimated expense relating to the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies  and  at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable as that term is defined in sfas no 
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 

table of contents deferred taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense 
at december   we have a minimal valuation allowance and have million of deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet 
the majority of deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates 
management currently believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations and or through available tax planning strategies to recover these assets 
however  given that these loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over years beginning in  there could be changes in management s judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets 
as of december   management believes that it is more likely than not that the unreserved portion of these deferred tax assets will be recovered 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued in december sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
 and its related implementation guidance  which allowed companies to use the intrinsic method of valuing share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payments transactions 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recording of the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  including grants of employee stock options  to be based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
as required  we adopted this statement effective as of january  due to the complexities and estimates required under the new standard  the company is still evaluating the expected impact in terms of both additional expense and the related per share impact 
sfas no 
r allows for either modified prospective recognition of compensation expense or modified retrospective recognition 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date of sfas no 
r based on the requirements of a sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to apply this standard using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method  and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an effect on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial condition 
actual share based compensation expense in fiscal will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of the new awards granted in  the fair value of those awards at the date of the grant  the fair value of the company s stock and estimates of expected forfeitures for all awards that are unvested at the date of adoption 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flow in periods after adoption to the extent actual current tax benefits are realized from option exercises 
sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  was issued in november sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas no 
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory costs be based on the normal 
table of contents capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  was issued in may sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles were recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we use to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had two interest rate swap agreements under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable interest rate on million of debt 
in  in accordance with sfas no 
 comprehensive income included million  net of income tax expense of million  related to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our debt portfolio total at total fair value at december  december  at december  thereafter in thousands  except percentages debt fixed rate average interest rate floating rate average interest rate operating leases included in our floating rate line of credit facility are million of fixed rate swap agreements with a weighted average interest rate of that mature in 
table of contents on february   we amended our credit facility which among other things  increased our borrowing capacity  reduced our interest rate and extended the terms of the agreement 
the table below represents  on a pro forma basis  the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our debt portfolio after giving effect to the terms of the amended agreement under the credit facility total at total fair value pro forma at december  december  at december  thereafter in thousands  except percentages debt fixed rate average interest rate floating rate average interest rate operating leases included in our floating rate line of credit facility are million of fixed rate swap agreements with a weighted average interest rate of that mature in impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we currently have branch operations in toronto  canada  and we invoice those customers primarily in the local currency  the canadian dollar  under the terms of our lease agreements with those customers 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our canadian branch operation are translated into us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has historically been insignificant
