overview historical background 
we originally incorporated as caldera systems  inc  a utah corporation as previously defined  caldera systems  on august   and reincorporated as a delaware corporation on march  in march  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
on may   we formed a new holding company in delaware under the name of caldera international  inc as previously defined  caldera international to acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups of the santa cruz operation 
in connection with this acquisition  caldera systems became a wholly owned subsidiary of caldera international 
former holders of shares and options to purchase shares of caldera systems received an equal number of shares and options to purchase shares in caldera international 
on may   our stockholders approved our corporate name change to the sco group  inc recent developments 
we discovered in that we had offered and sold shares of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  without complying with registration or qualification requirements under federal securities laws and the securities laws of california  utah and possibly other states 
as a result  those current and former employees had a right to rescind their purchases of shares under the espp or recover damages if they no longer owned the shares  subject to applicable statutes of limitations 
in december  we offered to rescind a total of  shares of common stock issued under our espp to current and former employees while they resided in california  connecticut  illinois  new jersey  utah  texas or washington 
these shares represented all of the espp shares we issued to residents of these states for which a purchaser could claim a rescission right 
the rescission offer was intended to address our rescission liability relating to our federal and state securities laws compliance issues by allowing the holders of the shares covered by the rescission offer to rescind the underlying securities transactions and sell those securities back to us or recover damages  as the case may be 
our rescission offer concluded on january  as of that date  offerees had accepted our offer to rescind the purchase of approximately  shares issued under our espp 
we plan to make aggregate payments to such offerees of approximately  which includes approximately  in applicable statutory interest and damages 
as a result of the rescission offer  we believe we have extinguished our state rescission liability and mitigated our federal rescission liability to anyone to whom the rescission offer was made for noncompliance with the registration or qualification requirements of federal and state securities laws as they relate to the shares issued under our espp 
the rescission offer did not address stock options that may have been issued without registration or qualification requirements under the securities laws of california  georgia and possibly other states 
we may still face rescission liability to plan participants holding unexercised stock options in these states 
business focus unix business 
our unix business serves the needs of small to medium sized businesses  including replicated site franchisees of fortune companies  by providing reliable  cost effective unix software technology for distributed  embedded and network based systems 
our largest source of unix business revenue is derived from existing customers through our worldwide  indirect  leveraged channel of partners  which includes distributors and independent solution providers 
we have a presence in a number of countries that provide support and services to customers and resellers 
the other principal channel for selling and marketing our unix products is through existing customers that have a large number of replicated sites or franchisees 
we access these corporations through their information technology or purchasing departments with our area sales managers asms in the united states and through our reseller channel in countries outside the united states 
in addition  we also sell our operating system products to original equipment manufacturers oems 
our sales of unix products and services during the last several years have been primarily to pre existing unix customers and not newly acquired customers 
our unix business revenue depends significantly on our ability to market and sell our products to existing customers and to generate upgrades from existing customers 
the following table and footnote shows the operating results of the unix business for the years ended october   and in thousands revenue cost of revenue gross margin sales and marketing research and development general and administrative other total operating expenses income loss from operations for the year ended october   other costs included  of amortization of intangibles and of stock based compensation 
for the year ended october   other costs included  of severance and exit costs   of amortization of intangibles   of losses on disposition and impairment of long lived assets  and of stock based compensation 
for the year ended october   other costs included  of amortization of intangibles   of stock based compensation  of severance and exit costs  of write offs of investments  and of losses on disposition and impairment of long lived assets 
revenue from our unix business decreased by  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  and decreased by  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the revenue from our unix business has been declining over the last several years primarily as a result of continued competition from alternative operating systems  particularly linux 
we believe that the inclusion of our unix code and derivative works in linux has been a contributor to the decline in our unix business revenue because users of linux generally do not pay for the operating system itself  but for services and maintenance 
in an effort to attain profitability in our unix business  we have decreased our costs in each of the last three years 
operating costs for our unix business decreased from  for the year ended october   to  for the year ended october   and then further decreased to  for the year ended october  these cost reductions have primarily been attributable to reduced headcount and consolidation of certain facilities 
in our unix business  we have reduced the number of full time equivalent employees from as of october   to as of october   and to as of october  we have taken these headcount reductions and reduced other discretionary spending while still maintaining a worldwide presence 
based on our cost cutting actions  we have planned that our unix business will continue to generate positive cash flow during the year ending october  the decline in our unix business revenue may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support as a result of our sco litigation 
the decline in our unix business and the sco litigation may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in revenue from our unix business 
scosource business 
during the year ended october   we became aware that our unix code and derivative works had been inappropriately included by others in the linux operating system 
we believe the inclusion of our unix code and derivative works in linux has been a contributor to the decline in our unix business because users of linux generally do not pay for the operating system itself  but pay for services and maintenance 
the linux operating system competes directly with our openserver and unixware products and has taken significant market share from these products 
in an effort to protect our unix intellectual property  we initiated our scosource business 
our scosource revenue for the years ended october  and was significantly lower than revenue generated during the year ended october  and we believe and allege our revenue and related revenue opportunities have been adversely impacted by novell s claim of unix copyright ownership  which may have caused potential customers to delay or forego licensing until an outcome in this legal matter has been reached 
the following table shows the results of operations for the scosource business in thousands revenue cost of revenue gross margin deficit sales and marketing research and development general and administrative compensation to law firms total operating expenses income loss from operations revenue from our scosource business decreased from  for the year ended october   to  for the year ended october   and to  for the year ended october  during the year ended october   scosource revenue was primarily attributable to two large vendor licenses 
we did not close similar transactions during the years ended october  and revenue for the years ended october  and was primarily attributable to sales of our scosource ip agreements 
cost of revenue increased from  for the year ended october  to  for the year ended october   which was primarily attributable to increased legal fees incurred in connection with our sco litigation 
cost of revenue decreased to  for the year ended october  and this decrease was primarily attributable to our modified fee agreement with the law firms the law firms representing us in the sco litigation that has significantly reduced our ongoing costs 
the decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to decreased personnel and related costs 
operating expenses for sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative decreased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october  the decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to decreased personnel and related costs 
the other expense for the year ended october  of  was attributable to a contingency fee payable to the law firms incurred in connection with the october issuance of our now retired series a convertible preferred stock 
this fee was not for attorney s fees for legal services  which fees have been recorded as cost of scosource licensing revenue and was paid in november because of the uncertainties related to our scosource business  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of future scosource licensing revenue 
we are unlikely to generate significant revenue from our scosource business unless and until we prevail in our sco litigation 
additionally  the success of the scosource business may depend on the strength of our intellectual property rights and claims regarding unix  including our claims against novell and the strength of our claim that unauthorized unix source code and derivative works are contained in linux 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current trends  future projections  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting estimates because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances  severance and exit costs  impairment of long lived assets  and allowances for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  as modified by sop revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements is complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
we recognize products revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable 
the majority of our revenue transactions relate to product only sales 
on occasion we have revenue transactions that include multiple elements such as products  maintenance  technical support services and other services 
for software agreements that have multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe is established when such elements are sold separately 
we recognize revenue when the criteria for product revenue recognition set forth above have been met 
if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists  but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the license fee is recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an arrangement is obtained assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for revenue recognition set forth above have been met 
estimates used in revenue recognition include the determination of credit worthiness of our customers  verification of sales out reporting to end users through our two tier distribution channel and the estimation of potential returns 
in addition to these estimates  we also provide reserves against revenue based on historical trends and experience 
to the extent our estimates are incorrect  or we are not able to maintain vsoe  our recognized revenue could be adversely impacted and would harm our results of operations 
additionally  if our business conditions change or our revenue contracts begin to contain more multiple elements  our revenue recognition in future periods may be impacted because a larger component of revenue may be deferred 
deferred income taxes and related valuation allowance 
the amount  and ultimate realization  of our deferred income tax assets depends  in part  upon the tax laws in effect  our future earnings  if any  and other future events  the effects of which cannot be determined 
we have provided a valuation allowance of  against our entire net deferred tax asset as of october  the valuation allowance was recorded because of our history of net operating losses and the uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability and taxable income 
severance and exit costs 
since  we have undertaken significant restructuring activities to reduce our ongoing cost of operations 
all restructurings that occurred prior to the year ended october  were accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
for restructuring activities initiated beginning with the year ended october   we have accounted for the one time termination benefits  contract termination costs and other associated costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
other severance benefits have been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit plans and for termination benefits 
each restructuring has required us to make estimates and assumptions related to losses on vacated facilities  provisions for termination benefits  outplacement costs and other costs 
pursuant to the relevant accounting literature  we may record an accrual for amounts associated with a restructuring that are not paid in the current period 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the accruals based on changes in estimates 
we may incur future charges for new restructuring activities 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate  at each balance sheet date  whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long lived asset 
we performed an impairment analysis as of october  and determined that the fair value of our remaining long lived assets was in excess of the current carrying values and that no impairment had occurred 
judgment from management is required to determine if a triggering event has occurred and in forecasting future operating results 
write downs of intangible assets may be necessary if the future fair value of these assets is less than carrying value 
if the operating trends for our unix or scosource businesses continue to decline we may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period related to the carrying value of our long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a majority of our customers and require no collateral from these customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all accounts receivable and have applied these policies consistently throughout the last three fiscal years 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  which is determined based on our historical experience and a specific review of customer balances  was  as of october  our past experience has resulted in minimal differences from the actual amounts provided for bad debts and our recorded estimates 
however  our actual bad debts in future periods may differ from our current estimates and the differences may be material  which may have an adverse impact on our future accounts receivable and cash position 
results of operations the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended october   and in thousands years ended october  statement of operations data revenue products scosource licensing services total revenue cost of revenue products scosource licensing services total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative severance and exit costs amortization of intangibles loss on disposition and impairment of long lived assets write off of investments stock based compensation compensation to law firms total operating expenses income loss from operations equity in income losses of affiliates other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss contributions from dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock net income available loss applicable to common stockholders years ended october   and revenue change change revenue revenue for the year ended october  decreased by  or  from the year ended october  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in unix products and services revenue as a result of continued competition from other operating systems  primarily linux 
revenue for the year ended october  decreased by  or  from the year ended october  this decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower scosource licensing revenue in the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  as well as a continued decline in our unix business 
revenue generated from our unix business and scosource business is as follows change change unix revenue percent of total revenue scosource revenue percent of total revenue the decrease in revenue in the unix business of  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  and the decrease in revenue of  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to continued competition from other operating systems  particularly linux 
we believe that the inclusion of our unix code and derivative works in linux has been a contributor to the decline in our unix revenue because users of linux generally do not pay for the operating system itself  but pay for services and maintenance 
we anticipate that for the year ending october  our total unix revenue will decline from unix revenue generated in the year ended october  as a result of this continued competition 
scosource revenue decreased by  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  and this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced sales of ip agreements 
the decrease in scosource licensing revenue of  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to minimal vendor licensing revenue in the year ended october  compared to significant vendor licensing revenue generated in the year ended october  as a result of two large vendor licenses 
sales of our unix products and services during the years ended october   and were primarily to pre existing customers 
our unix business revenue depends significantly on our ability to market our products to existing customers and to generate upgrades from existing customers 
our unix revenue may be lower than currently anticipated if we are not successful with our existing customers or if we lose the support of any of our existing hardware and software vendors or our key industry partners withdraw their marketing and certification support or direct their support to our competitors 
this may occur as a result of the decline of our unix business and our sco litigation 
products revenue change change products revenue percent of total revenue our products revenue consists of software licenses for unix products such as openserver and unixware  as well as sales of unix related products 
products revenue also includes revenue derived from oems  distribution partners and large end user accounts 
we rely heavily on our two tier distribution channel and any disruption in our distribution channel could have an adverse impact on future revenue 
the decrease in products revenue of  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and the decrease of  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to decreased sales of openserver and unixware products primarily resulting from continued competition in the operating system market  particularly linux 
we believe that this competition from linux will continue for the year ending october  and future periods 
our products revenue was derived primarily from sales of our openserver and unixware products 
other products revenue consists mainly of product maintenance and other unix related products 
revenue for these products was as follows change change openserver revenue percent of products revenue unixware revenue percent of products revenue other products revenue percent of products revenue the decreases in revenue for openserver  unixware and other products are all primarily the result of continued competition  particularly from linux operating system providers 
scosource licensing revenue change change scosource licensing revenue percent of total revenue we initiated our scosource business for the purpose of protecting our intellectual property rights in our unix source code and derivative works 
scosource licensing revenue was  for the year ended october  and  for the year ended october   down significantly from revenue of  generated in the year ended october  the scosource revenue for the years ended october  and was primarily attributable to sales of scosource ip agreements and the scosource licensing revenue in the year ended october  was primarily attributable to fees associated with two significant vendor licenses 
we believe and allege that our decrease in scosource revenue for the years ended october  and was in part attributable to novell s claim of unix copyright ownership  which may have caused potential customers to delay or forego licensing until an outcome in this legal matter has been reached 
we are unable to predict the amount and timing of future scosource licensing revenue  and  when generated  we expect that such revenue will be sporadic 
services revenue change change services revenue percent of total revenue services revenue consists primarily of annual and incident technical support fees  engineering services fees  professional services and consulting fees 
these fees are typically charged and invoiced separately from unix products sales 
the decrease in services revenue of  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and the decrease of  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to a decrease in products revenue and decreased professional services revenue 
the majority of our support and professional services revenue continues to be derived from services for unix based operating system products 
our future level of services revenue depends in part on our ability to generate unix products revenue from new customers as well as to renew annual support and services agreements with existing unix customers 
cost of products revenue change change cost of products revenue percentage of products revenue cost of products revenue consists of manufacturing costs  royalties to third party vendors  technology costs and overhead costs 
cost of products revenue decreased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and decreased  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  this decrease in cost of products revenue was primarily attributable to lower products revenue  as margins did not vary significantly 
for the year ending october   we expect the dollar amount of our cost of products revenue to be less than the year ended october  and  as a percentage of products revenue  to be consistent with the percentage achieved during the year ended october  cost of scosource licensing revenue change change cost of scosource licensing revenue cost of scosource licensing revenue includes legal and professional fees incurred in connection with our sco litigation  the salaries and related personnel costs of scosource employees  and an allocation of corporate costs 
cost of scosource licensing revenue decreased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and was primarily attributable to decreased legal costs incurred in connection with the sco litigation as a result of our engagement agreement with the law firms representing us 
cost of scosource licensing revenue increased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and was primarily attributable to increased legal costs incurred in connection with our sco litigation 
we anticipate that the dollar amount of our cost of scosource licensing revenue for the year ending october  will be lower than for the year ended october  as we make our final  payment that is due to the law firms and continue to make payments for expert  consulting and other fees 
however  future legal fees may include contingency payments made to the law firms as a result of a settlement  judgment  or a sale of our company  which could cause cost of scosource licensing revenue for the year ending october  to be higher than the year ended october  cost of services revenue change change cost of services revenue percentage of services revenue cost of services revenue includes the salaries and related personnel costs of employees delivering services revenue as well as third party service agreements 
cost of services revenue decreased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and decreased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and was primarily attributable to reduced employee and employee related costs 
for the year ending october   we expect the dollar amount of our cost of services revenue to be less than that incurred for the year ended october  and that cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue will be consistent to that generated for the year ended october  sales and marketing change change sales and marketing expense percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist of the salaries  commissions and other personnel costs of employees involved in the revenue generation process  as well as advertising and corporate allocations 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense of  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october   and the decrease of  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to reductions in sales and marketing employees  reduced travel expenses  less commissions and lower advertising costs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was the result of costs decreasing at a greater pace than our revenue decline and the increase from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was a result of lower revenue for the year ended october  our sales and marketing full time equivalent employees decreased from as of october   to as of october  to as of october  for the year ending october   we anticipate that the dollar amount of sales and marketing expense will decrease from the year ended october  research and development change change research and development expense percentage of total revenue research and development expense consists of the salaries and benefits of software engineers  consulting expenses and corporate allocations 
research and development expense decreased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and decreased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  during the years ended october  and  our engineering efforts were focused on the release of unixware and on the release of openserver  both significant releases of our two primary operating system products 
these development efforts required us to maintain our research and development infrastructure  which limited our ability to cut costs in this area as significantly as we have done in other areas 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue declined in the year ended october  as compared to the year ended october  as a result of costs decreasing at a greater pace than our revenue declined 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue increased in the year ended october  as compared to the year ended october  as a result of lower revenue in fiscal year our research and development full time equivalent employees decreased from as of october   to as of october  to as of october  for the year ending october   we anticipate that the dollar amount of research and development expense will decrease from the year ended october  general and administrative change change general and administrative expense percentage of total revenue general and administrative expense consists of the salaries and benefits of finance  human resources  and executive management and expenses for professional services such as legal and accounting services and corporate allocations 
general and administrative expense decreased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower personnel and related costs offset by increased legal and accounting costs related to the restatement of our quarterly financial statements and the preparation of our recently completed rescission offer 
general and administrative expense increased by  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increased legal costs as a result of corporate and regulatory legal matters not classified as cost of scosource licensing revenue and increased fees from other professional service providers 
general and administrative expense as a percent of total revenue increased during the years ended october  and as a result of increased costs and lower revenue 
our general and administrative full time equivalent employees decreased from as of october   to as of october   to as of october  for the year ending october   we anticipate that the dollar amount of general and administrative expense will decrease from the year ended october  severance and exit costs change change severance and exit costs n a percentage of total revenue during the year ended october   we did not record any charges for severance and exit costs 
during the years ended october  and  we recorded severance and exit costs totaling  and  respectively 
the severance and exit costs for the years ended october  and were comprised of termination payments made to employees in connection with reductions in headcount  closure of certain facilities and adjustments to previously recorded amounts as actual payments made were less than recorded accruals 
the detail of the activity in the accrual for severance and exit costs for the years ended october   and  are as follows year ended october  balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  ongoing severance and other year ended october  balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  one time severance ongoing severance and other facilities total year ended october  balance at november  additions adjustments utilization balance at october  one time severance ongoing severance and other facilities total the facilities adjustment of  was the result of successfully negotiating out of lease commitments in connection with our winding down of sco group  ltd 
in the united kingdom and the ongoing severance and other adjustment of  was related to the true up of previously recorded accruals 
amortization of intangibles change change amortization of intangibles percentage of total revenue during the years ended october   and  we recorded   and  respectively  for the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives 
the decrease of  or  from the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to reduced amortization expense recorded on certain assets acquired from vultus in june that were written off during the year ended october  the decrease of  or  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to reduced amortization expense recorded on certain assets acquired from vultus that were written off during the year ended october  and therefore were not amortized for the last half of the year ending october  loss on disposition and impairment of long lived assets change change loss on disposition and write down of long lived assets percentage of total revenue during the year ended october   we did not have any losses on the disposition and impairment of long lived assets 
during the years ended october  and  we recorded a write down of long lived assets of  and  respectively 
the loss on disposition and write down of long lived assets recorded during the year ended october  primarily related to goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of vultus in june we concluded that an impairment triggering event occurred during the year ended october  as we had a reduction in force that impacted our ability to move the vultus initiative forward on a stand alone basis and because an anticipated partnership that would have solidified the vultus revenue and cash flow opportunities did not materialize 
consequently  we concluded that no significant future cash flows related to our vultus assets will be realized 
the loss on disposition and write down of long lived assets recorded during the year ended october  was primarily attributable to assets written off in connection with restructurings that occurred during that year 
write offs of investments change change write offs of investments n a n a percentage of total revenue management routinely assesses our investments for impairments and adjusts the carrying amounts to estimated realizable values when impairment has occurred 
during the years ended october  and  we did not have any write offs of investments

equity in income losses of affiliate we account for our ownership interests in companies in which we own at least percent and less than percent using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we record our portion of the entities net income or net loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of october   the carrying value of our investments of  was related to our percent ownership in a chinese company 
during the years ended october   and  we recorded   and  respectively  that related to net income losses in these entities 
the income reported during the years ended october  and was attributable to our portion of the net income generated by the above mentioned chinese company 
the loss reported during the year ended october  was primarily attributable to losses generated from vista 
other income  net other income expense consisted of the following components for the years ended october   and interest income interest expense change in fair value of derivative other income expense  net total other income  net interest income decreased by  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and increased by  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  the changes in interest income are the result of changes in our cash and available for sale securities balances 
the income recorded on the change in fair value of derivative for the years ended october  and related to the decrease in fair value of this instrument and marking it to market at each balance sheet date 
the derivative financial instrument was eliminated during the three months ended april  the increase in other income  net  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to two items the collection of a note receivable from vintela  inc vintela as described in more detail in note to our financial statements  which note receivable was originally received in april  but because we received the note receivable in exchange for the transfer of certain software to a related party and there was substantial doubt concerning the ability of vintela to repay the note  no gain was recognized until the three months ended january  when we received payment  and the sale of shares we held in troll tech as troll tech as described in more detail in note to our financial statements 
the troll tech shares had been written off in the year ended october   but because they were sold during the three months ended april   we recorded income for the proceeds received 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the years ended october   and was   and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes of  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  and the increase of  from the year ended october  to the year ended october  was primarily attributable to an accrual for withholding taxes of approximately  made in the year ended october  in connection with our operations in india 
other than the accrual previously mentioned  our provision for income taxes is primarily related to earnings in foreign subsidiaries as well as from withholding taxes on revenue generated in certain foreign locations 
as of october   we had net operating loss carry forwards for us federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately  that expire at various dates between and we had net deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary differences between book and tax deductions  totaling approximately  as of october  we also had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately  related to taxes on foreign earnings 
a valuation allowance in the amount of  the difference between our deferred tax assets and liabilities  has been recorded as of october  as a result of uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizability of the net deferred tax assets 
contributions from dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock in october  we issued  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock for  per share

as a result of the factors listed above and elsewhere in the forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results and financial condition and risk factors sections of this form k  it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may fall below management s expectations as well as the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if revenue falls below management s expectations in any quarter and we are unable to reduce expenses  our operating results will be lower than expected 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased from  as of october  to  as of october  during this same time period  our investment in available for sale securities decreased from  to  total cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities were  as of october  as of october   we also have  classified as restricted cash  of which  is set aside to cover expert and other costs related to our sco litigation and  is set aside for royalties payable to novell 
during the year ended october   we expended a significant amount of cash in pursuit of our sco litigation 
we intend to use the cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of october  to pursue our sco litigation and to run our unix business 
on november   we completed the sale of approximately  shares of our common stock in a private placement and raised gross proceeds of  we believe that with the combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of october  together with the proceeds from our recent financing that we will have sufficient cash resources to fund our current operations for at least the next months

our financing activities used  of cash during the year ended october  the primary uses of cash were  for the repurchase and retirement of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock   for the purchase of shares of our common stock on the open market  and  paid in connection with the issuance of series a shares in exchange for outstanding series a shares 
these uses of cash were offset  in part  by proceeds generated from the exercise of options to acquire common stock of  and proceeds of  received from the sale of common stock through the espp 
our financing activities provided  of cash during the year ended october  and consisted primarily of net proceeds of  generated from our issuance of  now retired series a shares 
additional financing activities included proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of  proceeds from the purchase of shares of common stock by our employees through our espp of  and proceeds from the issuance of warrants of  our net accounts receivable balance decreased from  as of october  to  as of october   primarily as a result of lower invoicing and revenue generated during the three months ended october  as compared to the three months ended october  the majority of our accounts receivable are current and our allowance for doubtful accounts was  as of october   which represented approximately percent of our gross accounts receivable balance 
this percentage of gross accounts receivable is consistent with our experience in prior periods  and we expect this trend to continue 
our write offs of uncollectible accounts during the years ended october   and were not significant 
on october   we entered into the engagement agreement with the law firms 
the engagement agreement supercedes and replaces the original engagement agreement that was entered into in february the engagement agreement governs the relationship between us and the law firms in connection with their representation of us in the sco litigation  through the end of our current litigation with ibm 
this litigation is described in more detail under part i  item of this form k 
our purpose in entering into this engagement agreement was to limit the cash expenditures needed to pursue the sco litigation 
the engagement agreement provides for the payment of approximately  for all attorneys fees in connection with the sco litigation through the end of our current litigation with ibm and the escrow of at least  for the payment of any expert  consulting and other expenses 
as of december   we had paid the entire  as of october    remained in the escrow account and was classified as a component of restricted cash 
in the event that we exhaust this remaining balance  we will continue to pay for expert  consulting and other expenses through the conclusion of our litigation with ibm 
in addition to the cash expenditures mentioned above  we must also pay one or more contingency fees upon any amount we or our stockholders may receive as a result of a settlement  judgment  or a sale of our company 
the contingency fee amounts payable to the law firms will be  subject to certain credits and adjustments  as follows percent of any aggregate recovery amounts received up to  plus percent of any aggregate recovery amounts above  but less than or equal to  plus percent of any aggregate recovery amounts in excess of  the engagement agreement specifically provides that  except for the compensation obligations specifically described above  we will not be obligated to pay any legal fees  whether hourly  contingent or otherwise  to the law firms  or any other law firms that may be engaged by the law firms  in connection with the sco litigation through the end of the current litigation between us and ibm  including any appeals 
we have entered into operating leases for our corporate offices located in the united states and our international sales offices 
we have commitments under these leases that extend through the year ending october  the following table summarizes our contractual operating lease obligations and our required payments to the law firms as of october  total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations payments to law firms total obligations as of october   we did not have any long term debt obligations  purchase obligations  other long term liabilities or material capital lease obligations 
our ability to reduce costs to offset revenue declines in our unix business is limited because of contractual commitments to maintain and support our existing unix customers 
this decline in our unix business may be accelerated if industry partners withdraw their support as a result of the sco litigation 
in addition  the sco litigation may cause industry partners  developers and hardware and software vendors to choose not to support or certify to our unix operating system products 
this would lead to an accelerated decline in our unix products and services revenue 
if our unix products and services revenue is less than expected  our liquidity will be adversely impacted 
in the event that cash required to fund operations and strategic initiatives exceeds our current cash resources and cash generated from operations  we will be required to reduce costs and perhaps raise additional capital 
we may not be able to reduce costs in a manner that does not impair our ability to maintain our unix business and pursue the sco litigation 
we may also not be able to raise capital for any number of reasons including those listed under the section risk factors under part i  item a of this form k 
if additional equity financing is available  it may not be available to us on attractive terms and may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  if our stock price declines  we may not be able to access the public equity markets on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to effect acquisitions for stock would also be impaired

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we have foreign offices and operations in europe and asia 
as a result  a portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
our international revenue is denominated in us dollars  euros and united kingdom pounds 
most of the operating expenses related to our foreign based operations are denominated in foreign currencies and therefore operating results are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the euro  among others 
if the us dollar further weakens compared to the euro  our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when translated back into us dollars 
our revenue can also be affected by general economic conditions in the united states  europe and other international markets 
our results of operations may be affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our cash management strategy is to invest available funds in a manner that assures maximum safety and liquidity and maximizes yield within such constraints 
we believe that a hypothetical movement in interest rates  either up or down  would not have a material adverse impact on our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we do not borrow money for short term investment purposes 
investment risk 
we have invested in equity instruments of privately held and public companies in the technology industry for business and strategic purposes 
investments are accounted for under the cost method if our ownership is less than percent and we are not able to exercise influence over operations 
our investment policy is to regularly review the assumptions and operating performance of these companies and to record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired 
as of october   our investments balance totaled approximately  and consisted of our investment in a owned chinese company 
the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  has experienced price fluctuations 
in addition  factors such as new product introductions by our competitors or developments in the sco litigation may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  quarter to quarter fluctuations in our results of operations may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these conditions could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods of time
