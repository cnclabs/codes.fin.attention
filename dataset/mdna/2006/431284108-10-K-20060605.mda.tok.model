overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed equity reit that provides leasing  management  development  construction and other customer related services for our properties and for third parties 
as of december   we owned or had an interest in in service office  industrial and retail properties  encompassing approximately million square feet and apartment units and two in service office and retail development properties that had not yet reached stabilized occupancy aggregating approximately  square feet 
as of that date  we also owned development land and other properties under development as described under item business above 
we are based in raleigh  north carolina  and our properties and development land are located in florida  georgia  iowa  kansas  maryland  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 

table of contents results of operations approximately of our rental and other revenue in was derived from our office properties 
as a result  while we own and operate a limited number of industrial  retail and apartment properties  our operating results depend heavily on successfully leasing our office properties 
furthermore  since approximately of our office properties are located in florida  georgia and north carolina  economic growth in those states is and will continue to be an important determinative factor in predicting our future operating results 
accordingly  most of the analysis and comments below focus on our office properties 
the key components affecting our rental revenue stream are dispositions  acquisitions  new developments placed in service  average occupancy and rental rates 
average occupancy generally increases during times of improving economic growth  as our ability to lease space outpaces vacancies that occur upon the expirations of existing leases  while average occupancy generally declines during times of slower economic growth  when new vacancies tend to outpace our ability to lease space 
asset acquisitions  dispositions and new developments placed in service directly impact our rental revenues and could impact our average occupancy  depending upon the occupancy percentage of the properties that are acquired  sold or placed in service 
a further indicator of the predictability of future revenues is the expected lease expirations of our portfolio 
as a result  in addition to seeking to increase our average occupancy by leasing current vacant space  we also must concentrate our leasing efforts on renewing leases on expiring space 
for more information regarding our lease expirations  see properties lease expirations 
whether or not our rental revenue tracks average occupancy proportionally depends upon whether rents under new leases signed are higher or lower than the rents under the previous leases 
during  the average rental rate per square foot on new leases signed in our wholly owned properties was lower than the rent under the previous leases based on straight line rental rates 
our expenses primarily consist of rental property expenses  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
rental property expenses are expenses associated with our ownership and operation of rental properties and include variable expenses  such as common area maintenance and utilities  and fixed expenses  such as property taxes and insurance 
some of these variable expenses may be lower when our average occupancy declines  while fixed expenses remain constant regardless of average occupancy 
depreciation and amortization is a non cash expense associated with the ownership of real property and generally remains relatively consistent each year  unless we buy or sell assets  since we depreciate our properties on a straight line basis over a fixed life 
general and administrative expenses  net of amounts capitalized  consist primarily of management and employee salaries and other personnel costs  corporate overhead and long term incentive compensation 
interest expense depends upon the amount of our borrowings  the weighted average interest rates on our debt and the amount of interest capitalized on development projects 
we record in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates our proportionate share of net income or loss  adjusted for purchase accounting effects  of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
additionally  sfas no 
requires us to record net income received from properties sold or held for sale that qualify as discontinued operations under sfas no 
separately as income from discontinued operations 
as a result  we separately record revenues and expenses from these qualifying properties 
as also required by sfas no 
 prior period results are reclassified to reflect the operations for such properties in discontinued operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we incur capital expenditures to lease space to our customers and to maintain the quality of our properties to successfully compete against other properties 
tenant improvements are the costs required to customize the space for the specific needs of the customer 
lease commissions are costs incurred to find the customer for the space 
lease incentives are costs paid to or on behalf of tenants to induce them to enter into leases and which do not relate to customizing the space for the tenant s specific needs 
building improvements are recurring capital costs not related to a customer to maintain the buildings 
as leases expire  we either attempt to relet the space to an existing customer or attract a new customer to occupy the space 
generally  customer renewals require lower leasing capital expenditures than reletting to new customers 
however  market conditions such as supply of available space on the market  as well as demand for space  drive not only customer rental rates but also tenant improvement costs 
leasing capital expenditures are amortized over the term of the lease and building improvements are depreciated over the appropriate useful life of the assets acquired 
both are included in depreciation and amortization in results of operations 
because we are a reit  we are required under the federal tax laws to distribute at least of our reit taxable income  excluding capital gains  to our stockholders 
we generally use rents received from customers and proceeds from sales of non core development land to fund our operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures and stockholder dividends 
to fund property acquisitions  development activity or building renovations  we may sell other assets and may incur debt from time to time 
as of december   we had million of secured debt outstanding and million of unsecured debt outstanding 
our debt generally consists of mortgage debt  unsecured debt securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of may   we had approximately million of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility excluding the million expansion option and we had approximately million in available cash and short term investments 
our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding long term unsecured debt securities require us to satisfy various operating and financial covenants and performance ratios 
as a result  to ensure that we do not violate the provisions of these debt instruments  we may from time to time be limited in undertaking certain activities that may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders  such as repurchasing capital stock  acquiring additional assets  increasing the total amount of our debt or increasing stockholder dividends 
we review our current and expected operating results  financial condition and planned strategic actions on an ongoing basis for the purpose of monitoring our continued compliance with these covenants and ratios 
any unwaived event of default could result in an acceleration of some or all of our debt  severely restrict our ability to incur additional debt to fund short and long term cash needs or result in higher interest expense 
in may  july  august and september and february  we obtained waivers from the lenders under our previous revolving credit facility and our previous bank term loans related to timely reporting to the lenders of annual and quarterly financial statements and to covenant violations that could arise from future redemptions of preferred stock due to the reclassification of the preferred stock from equity to a liability during the period of time from the announcement of the redemption until the redemption is completed 
the aforementioned modifications did not change the economic terms of the loans 
in connection with these modifications  we incurred certain loan costs that are capitalized and amortized over the remaining terms of the loans 
in november  we amended the million bank term loan to extend the maturity date to july  and reduce the spread over the libor interest rate from basis points to basis points 
both of these loans were paid off in may in connection with our closing of a new revolving credit facility 

table of contents to generate additional capital to fund our growth and other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property  we may sell some of our properties or contribute them to joint ventures 
when we create a joint venture with a strategic partner  we usually contribute one or more properties that we own and or vacant land to a newly formed entity in which we retain an interest of or less 
in exchange for our equal or minority interest in the joint venture  we generally receive cash from the partner and retain some or all of the management income relating to the properties in the joint venture 
the joint venture itself will frequently borrow money on its own behalf to finance the acquisition of  and or leverage the return upon  the properties being acquired by the joint venture or to build or acquire additional buildings 
such borrowings are typically on a non recourse or limited recourse basis 
we generally are not liable for the debts of our joint ventures  except to the extent of our equity investment  unless we have directly guaranteed any of that debt 
in most cases  we and or our strategic partners are required to guarantee customary exceptions to non recourse liability in non recourse loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain debt guarantees 
we have historically also sold additional common stock or preferred stock or issued common units to fund additional growth or to reduce our debt  but we have limited those efforts since because funds generated from our capital recycling program in recent years have provided sufficient funds to satisfy our liquidity needs 
in addition  we have recently used funds from our capital recycling program to redeem common units and preferred stock for cash 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to the following table sets forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and in millions 
as noted above and as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as required by sfas no 
 results for the year ended december  were reclassified from previously reported amounts to reflect in discontinued operations the operations for those properties sold or held for sale in which qualified for discontinued operations presentation 
year ended december  to change change rental and other revenues operating expenses rental property and other expenses depreciation and amortization impairment of assets held for use general and administrative total operating expenses interest expense contractual amortization of deferred financing costs financing obligations other income expense interest and other income settlement of bankruptcy claim loss on debt extinguishments income loss before disposition of property  minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates gains and impairments on disposition of property  net minority interest in the operating partnership equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of minority interest gains and impairments of discontinued operations  net of minority interest net income dividends on preferred stock excess of preferred stock redemption value over carrying value net income available for common stockholders rental and other revenues the million increase in rental and other revenues from continuing operations was primarily the result of higher average occupancy in compared to  revenues contributed from new development properties placed in service during the second half of  and higher termination fee income in these positive increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenues from sold properties that were not classified as discontinued operations 
as of the date of this filing  we continue to see modest improvements in employment trends in several of our markets and an improving economic climate in the southeast 
there has been modest positive absorption of office space in most of our markets during the past year 
also  we expect to deliver approximately  square feet of new office  industrial and retail development properties by the end of  which are pre leased as of may  we expect rental and other revenues to decrease slightly in due to the disposition of certain properties in and  partially offset by rental and other revenues from the development properties placed in service during the second half of and those expected to be delivered by the end of 
table of contents operating expenses rental and other operating expenses from continuing operations real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses increased million in compared to  primarily as a result of higher average occupancy in and general inflationary increases in certain operating expenses  such as salaries  benefits  utility costs and real estate taxes 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses from sold properties that were not classified as discontinued operations 
our operating margin  defined as rental and other revenue less rental property and other expenses expressed as a percentage of rental and other revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease in margin was primarily caused by operating expenses increasing from inflationary pressures at a higher rate than our rental revenues and operating cost recoveries 
we expect rental and other operating expenses to decrease slightly in due to the disposition of certain properties in and this decrease will be partly offset by inflationary increases in certain fixed operating expenses  particularly higher utility costs and by operating expenses of the development properties placed in service during the second half of and those expected to be delivered by the end of depreciation and amortization from continuing operations increased slightly in this slight increase primarily resulted from a relatively higher proportion in of leasing assets tenant improvements and deferred leasing costs which have shorter lives compared to buildings which are depreciated over years 
this was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization from sold properties that were not classified as discontinued operations 
we expect depreciation and amortization to decrease slightly in due to a further net reduction of our wholly owned portfolio 
impairments on assets held for use were million in compared to none in in one land parcel and one office property  which are classified as held for use  had indicators of impairment where the carrying value exceeded the sum of projected undiscounted future cash flows 
accordingly  we recognized impairment losses of million during the year ended december  the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in as compared to primarily relates to million recognized in in connection with a retirement package for our former chief executive officer see note to the consolidated financial statements and a million decrease in compared to primarily relating to costs of personnel  consultants and our independent auditors in connection with a the initial implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act in  b evaluation of a strategic transaction in  and c the preparation and audit of the restated consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k 
these decreases were partially offset by million net increase primarily related to higher long term incentive compensation costs  salary and fringe benefit costs and other costs 
in  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly primarily from inflationary increases in compensation  benefits and other costs 
interest expense the million decrease in contractual interest was primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings from  million in to  million in  partially offset by an increase in weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt from in to in the decrease in average debt balances outstanding in was primarily due to the debt reductions made during as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  capitalized interest in was approximately million higher compared to due to increased development activity and higher average construction and development costs 
the million decrease in interest expense on financing obligations was primarily a result of the purchase of our partner s interest in the orlando city group properties in mg hiw  llc on march  which eliminated the requirement to record financing obligation interest expense with respect to the orlando city group properties after that date see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents total interest expense is expected to decline in primarily due to the reduction in our outstanding debt as discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  an increase in capitalized interest due to additional development activity is expected to further decrease net interest expense 
these declines will be partly offset by expected increases in average interest rates on our variable rate debt in other income expense in  we received net proceeds of million as a result of the settlement of the bankruptcy of worldcom see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this settlement 
loss on debt extinguishments decreased million from million in to million in in  a million loss was recorded related to the retirement of the exercisable put option notes described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the million of loss in relates to certain of the loans that were paid off early in from proceeds raised from disposition activities 
gains and impairments on disposition of property  minority interest  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates gains net of impairments on dispositions of properties not classified as discontinued operations were million in compared to million in  the components of net gains are set out in note to the consolidated financial statements 
gains and impairments are dependent on the specific assets sold  their historical cost basis and other factors  and can vary significantly from period to period 
most of the net gains in primarily related to two transactions described in note to the consolidated financial statements in which we sold an office building in raleigh  north carolina to an owner user and all of our operating properties and certain vacant land in charlotte  north carolina and certain operating properties in tampa  florida 
the largest amount of the net gains in primarily related to the transaction described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in which we contributed operating properties located in orlando  florida to hiw kc orlando  llc 
minority interest in the continuing operations of the operating partnership  after preferred unit distributions  decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  due to a corresponding decrease in the operating partnership s loss from continuing operations after preferred unit distributions 
the million increase in equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates was primarily a result of an increase related to the formation of the hiw kc orlando  llc joint venture in late june  which contributed approximately million of additional equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates in in addition  the plaza colonnade  llc joint venture  which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of  contributed approximately million more to equity in earnings in compared to discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 we classified net income of million and million  net of minority interest  as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts pertained to million square feet of property and apartment units sold during and and million square feet of property held for sale at december  these amounts include gains  net of impairments  of discontinued operations of million and million  net of minority interest  in the years ended december  and  respectively  the components of net gains are set out in note to the consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividends and excess of preferred stock redemption costs in excess of carrying value we recorded million and million in preferred stock dividends in and  respectively 
the reduction was due to the redemption of million of preferred stock in the third quarter of in connection with the redemption of preferred stock  the million excess of the redemption cost over the net carrying amount of the redeemed shares was recorded as a reduction to net income available for common shareholders in in accordance with eitf topic d

gains are dependent on the specific assets sold  their historical cost basis and other factors  and can vary significantly from period to period 
most of the net gains in primarily related to the transaction described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in which we contributed operating properties located in orlando  florida to hiw kc orlando  llc 
the million decrease in co venture expense was due to our acquisition of our partner s interest in the non orlando city group properties in july and the resultant elimination of recording co venture expense as of that date 
minority interest in the continuing operations of the operating partnership  after preferred unit distributions  decreased from million in to million in due to a corresponding decrease in the operating partnership s loss from continuing operations  after preferred unit distributions 
the million increase in equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates was primarily a result of a gain of million recognized in by a certain joint venture related to the disposition of land  of which our portion was million  an increase related to the formation of the hiw kc orlando  llc joint venture in  which contributed approximately million to equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates in  and an increase of million related to the addition of three office properties in to the highwoods markel associates  llc joint venture

net income and net income allocable to common stockholders we recorded net income million in compared to million in  and net income allocable to common stockholders of million in compared to million in  these changes resulted from the various factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources statement of cash flows as required by gaap  we report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
the following table sets forth the changes in our cash flows from to in thousands year ended december  change cash provided by operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities total cash flows 
table of contents in calculating cash flow from operating activities  gaap requires us to add depreciation and amortization  which are non cash expenses  back to net income 
as a result  we have historically generated a significant positive amount of cash from operating activities 
from period to period  cash flow from operations depends primarily upon changes in our net income  as discussed more fully above under results of operations  changes in receivables and payables and net additions or decreases in our overall portfolio  which affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense 
cash provided by or used in investing activities generally relates to capitalized costs incurred for leasing and major building improvements and our acquisition  development  disposition and joint venture activity 
during periods of significant net acquisition and or development activity  our cash used in such investing activities will generally exceed cash provided by investing activities  which typically consists of cash received upon the sale of properties and distributions of capital from our joint ventures 
during and  since our disposition activity outpaced our investment  development and acquisition activity  we recorded positive cash flow from investing activities in both years 
cash used in financing activities generally relates to stockholder dividends  distributions on common units  incurrence and repayment of debt and sales  repurchases or redemptions of common stock  common units and preferred stock 
as discussed previously  we use a significant amount of our cash to fund stockholder dividends and common unit distributions 
whether or not we incur significant new debt during a period depends generally upon the net effect of our acquisition  disposition  development and joint venture activity 
we use our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes  which means that during any given period  in order to minimize interest expense associated with balances outstanding under our revolving credit facility  we will likely record significant repayments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of the timing of receipt of revenues and payment of expenses and from lower cash flows from operating activities after adjusting net income for non cash depreciation and amortization  gains and impairments on disposition of properties  and loss on debt extinguishment 
the increase of million in cash provided by investing activities was primarily a result of million higher sales of non core properties in compared to offset by million in higher additions for real estate assets  largely from new development projects in  and by an million decrease in other investing activities which represented an increase in restricted cash caused by a cash escrow established to un encumber a secured property that was sold 
cash used in financing activities increased million from to in compared to  net repayments on our revolving credit facility  mortgages and notes payable increased by million  cash paid for the repurchase of common stock and common units increased by million  and cash used to redeem preferred stock increased million 
offsetting these increased uses of cash were a reduction in cash paid on financing obligations of million see note to the consolidated financial statements and a million reduction in cash paid for debt extinguishments 
during  we expect to have positive cash flows from operating activities 
the net cash flows from investing activities in are expected to be positive based on our expected level of property dispositions  net of cash used for development  capitalized leasing and tenant improvement costs 
positive cash flows from operating and investing activities in are expected to be used to pay stockholder and unitholder distributions  scheduled debt maturities  principal amortization payments and pay down of debt and redemption of preferred stock see note to the consolidated financial statements

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in connection with tax increment financing for construction of a public garage related to an office building constructed by us  we are obligated to pay fixed special assessments over a year period 
the net present value of these assessments  discounted at  is shown as a financing obligation in the balance sheet 
we also receive special tax revenues and property tax rebates which are intended  but not guaranteed  to provide funds to pay the special assessments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
these liabilities represent gains that were deferred in accordance with sfas no 
when we sold these properties to third parties 
we defer gains on sales of real estate up to our maximum exposure to contingent loss 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
represents a fixed obligation we owe our partner in highwoods dlf  lp 
this amount arose from an excess contribution from our partner at the formation of the joint venture and is recorded in other liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest components of the contractual obligations are based on the stated fixed rates in the instruments  for floating rate debt  interest is computed using the current rate in effect at december  
table of contents refinancings and preferred stock redemptions in and first quarter of during and the first quarter of  we paid off million of outstanding loans  excluding any normal debt amortization  which included million of secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of and million of unsecured floating rate debt with an interest rate of 
included in the million was million of floating rate secured debt 
approximately million of real estate assets based on undepreciated cost basis became unencumbered after paying off the secured debt 
we also used some of the proceeds from our disposition activity to redeem  in august and february  all of our outstanding series d preferred shares and million of our outstanding series b preferred shares  aggregating million plus accrued dividends 
these reductions in outstanding debt and preferred stock balances were made primarily from proceeds from property dispositions that closed in and in connection with the redemption of preferred stock  the excess of the redemption cost over the net carrying amount of the redeemed shares was recorded as a reduction to net income available for common shareholders 
these reductions amounted to million and million for the third quarter and first quarter  respectively 
unsecured indebtedness on may   we obtained a new million  three year unsecured revolving credit facility from bank of america  na we used million of proceeds from the new revolving credit facility  together with available cash  to pay off the remaining outstanding balance of million under our previous revolving credit facility and the million bank term loan  both of which have now been terminated 
in connection with these payoffs  we expect to write off approximately million in unamortized deferred financing costs in the second quarter of as a loss on debt extinguishment 
we and bank of america plan to syndicate the new revolving credit facility later in our new revolving credit facility is initially scheduled to mature on may  we have an option to extend the maturity date by one additional year assuming no default exists and  at any time prior to may   we may request increases in the borrowing availability under the credit facility by up to an additional million 
the increases in borrowing availability are subject to approval by the lender s 
the interest rate has been reduced from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points and the annual base facility fee has been reduced from basis points to basis points 
like our previous revolving credit facility  the new revolving credit facility requires us to comply with customary operating covenants and various financial and operating ratios 
we believe the required financial and operating ratios under the new revolving credit facility are less stringent and more appropriately reflect our current and future business prospects than the requirements under our previous revolving credit facility 
we expect to be in compliance with these provisions of our new revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future 
however  depending upon our future operating performance and property and financing transactions and general economic conditions  we cannot assure you that no circumstance will arise in the future that would render us unable to comply with any of these covenants or result in an increase in the borrowing costs under this facility 
if any of our lenders ever accelerated outstanding debt due to an event of default  we would not be able to borrow any further amounts under our revolving credit facility  which would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations 
if our debt cannot be paid  refinanced or extended at maturity or upon acceleration  in addition to our failure to repay our debt  we may not be able to make distributions to stockholders at expected levels or at all 
furthermore  if any refinancing is done at higher interest rates  the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flows and ability to make distributions to stockholders 
any such refinancing could also impose tighter financial ratios and other covenants that would restrict our ability to take actions that would otherwise be in our stockholders best interest  such as funding new development activity  making opportunistic acquisitions  repurchasing our securities or paying distributions 

table of contents in may  july  august and september and february  we obtained waivers from the lenders under our previous revolving credit facility and our previous bank term loans related to timely reporting to the lenders of annual and quarterly financial statements and to covenant violations that could arise from future redemptions of preferred stock due to the reclassification of the preferred stock from equity to a liability during the period of time from the announcement of the redemption until the redemption is completed 
the aforementioned modifications did not change the economic terms of the loans 
in connection with these modifications  we incurred certain loan costs that are capitalized and amortized over the remaining terms of the loans 
in november  we amended the million bank term loan to extend the maturity date to july  and reduce the spread over the libor interest rate from basis points to basis points 
these loans were paid off in may in connection with the closing of our new revolving credit facility  as described above 
as of the date of this filing  the operating partnership has not yet satisfied its requirement under the indenture governing the outstanding notes to file timely sec reports  but expects to do so as soon as practicable 
under the indenture  the notes may be accelerated if the trustee or of the holders provide written notice of a default and such default remains uncured after days 
if the operating partnership failed to file its delinquent sec reports prior to expiration of the day cure period after receipt of any such default notice  the lender under our revolving credit facility would also have the ability to accelerate amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
to date  neither the trustee nor any holder has sent us any such default notice 
the operating partnership is in compliance with all other covenants under the indenture and is current on all payments required thereunder 
current and future cash needs rental revenue  together with construction management  maintenance  leasing and management fees  is our principal source of funds to meet our short term liquidity requirements  which primarily consist of operating expenses  debt service  stockholder dividends  any guarantee obligations and recurring capital expenditures 
in addition  we could incur tenant improvements and lease commissions related to any releasing of vacant space 
we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of available working capital  cash flows from operations and the following the selective disposition of non core land and other assets  borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has up to million of availability as of may   excluding the million expansion option and under our existing million secured revolving construction loan all of which was available at may   the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties  development projects and development land to strategic joint ventures to be formed with unrelated investors  which would have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions  the issuance of secured debt  and the issuance of new unsecured debt 
our long term liquidity needs generally include the funding of capital expenditures to lease space to our customers  maintain the quality of our existing properties and build new properties 
capital expenditures include tenant improvements  building improvements  new building completion costs and land infrastructure costs 
tenant improvements are the costs required to customize space for the specific needs of first generation and second generation customers 
building improvements are recurring capital costs not related to a specific customer to maintain existing buildings 
new building completion costs are expenses for the construction of new buildings 
land infrastructure costs are expenses to prepare development land for future development activity that is not specifically related to a single building 
at december   remaining commitments under contractual purchase obligations for these capital expenditures aggregated approximately million 
excluding recurring capital expenditures for leasing costs and tenant improvements and for normal building improvements  our expected future capital expenditures for started and or committed new development projects as of may  are approximately million 
a significant portion of these future expenditures are currently subject to binding contractual arrangements 

table of contents additionally  million of unsecured notes will mature in december and approximately million of secured debt will mature in february we expect to repay both borrowings with proceeds from pending or future disposition activity and the issuance of additional unsecured debt 
we also have a significant pool of unencumbered assets that could serve as collateral for additional secured debt 
although we expect to repay or refinance all of this outstanding debt on or prior to their respective maturity dates  no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so on favorable terms or at all 
our long term liquidity needs also include the funding of development commitments  selective asset acquisitions and the retirement of mortgage debt  amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and long term unsecured debt 
our goal is to maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
accordingly  we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of the issuance by the operating partnership of additional unsecured debt securities  the issuance of additional equity securities by the company and the operating partnership  borrowings under other secured construction loans that we may enter into  as well as the sources described above with respect to our short term liquidity 
we expect to use such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements either through direct payments or repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as mentioned above  we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured indebtedness upon maturity 
instead  we will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of equity or debt securities or from proceeds from sales of properties 
we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs in both the short and long term 
however  if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and satisfy other cash payments may be adversely affected 
stockholder dividends to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must distribute to stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  excluding capital gains 
reit taxable income  the calculation of which is determined by the federal tax laws  does not equal net income under gaap 
we generally expect to use our cash flow from operating activities for dividends to stockholders and for payment of recurring capital expenditures 
future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors 
the following factors will affect our cash flows and  accordingly  influence the decisions of the board of directors regarding dividends debt service requirements after taking into account debt covenants and the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness  scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases  changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases  changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and execution of leases for newly acquired or developed properties  operating expenses and capital replacement needs  including tenant improvements and leasing costs  and sales of properties and non core land 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have several off balance sheet joint venture and guarantee arrangements 
the joint ventures were formed with unrelated investors to generate additional capital to fund property acquisitions  repay outstanding debt or fund other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property 
when we create a joint venture with a strategic partner  we usually contribute one or more properties that we own to a newly formed entity in which we retain an interest of or less 
in exchange for an equal or minority interest in the joint venture  we generally receive cash from the partner and frequently retain the management income relating to the properties in the joint venture 
for financial reporting purposes  certain assets we sold have been accounted for as financing and or profit sharing arrangements see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
as required by gaap  we use the equity method of accounting for our unconsolidated joint ventures in which we exercise significant influence but do not control the major operating and financial policies of the entity regarding encumbering the entities with debt and the acquisition or disposal of properties 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet and the results of operations of these joint ventures are not included on our income statement  other than as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
generally  we are not liable for the debts of our joint ventures  except to the extent of our equity investment  unless we have directly guaranteed any of that debt 
in most cases  we and or our strategic partners are required to guarantee customary limited exceptions to non recourse liability in non recourse loans 
as of december   our unconsolidated joint ventures had million of total assets and million of total liabilities as reflected in their financial statements 
at december   our weighted average equity interest based on the total assets of these unconsolidated joint ventures was

all of this joint venture debt is non recourse to us except in the case of customary exceptions pertaining to such matters as misuse of funds  environmental conditions and material misrepresentations and those guarantees and loans described in the following paragraphs 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of our share of the outstanding debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures as of december  in thousands thereafter in connection with the des moines joint ventures  we guaranteed certain debt and the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees is million 
of this amount  million arose from housing revenue bonds that require credit enhancements in addition to the real estate mortgages 
the bonds bear a floating interest rate  which at december  averaged  and mature in a guarantee of million of debt of the des moines joint ventures will expire upon an industrial building becoming leased or when the related loan matures 
as of december   this building was leased 
the remaining million in guarantees of debt of the des moines joint ventures relate to loans on four office buildings that were in the lease up phase at the time the loans were initiated 
each of the loans will mature by may the average occupancy of the four buildings at december  was 
if the joint ventures are unable to repay the outstanding balances under the loans that we have guaranteed  we will be required  under the terms of the agreements  to repay the outstanding balances 
recourse provisions exist that enable us to recover some or all of such payments from the joint ventures assets and or the other partners 
the joint ventures currently generate sufficient cash flow to cover the debt service required by the loans 

table of contents in connection with the rrhwoods  llc joint venture  we renewed our guarantee of million to a bank in july  this guarantee expires in august and may be renewed by us 
the bank provides a letter of credit securing industrial revenue bonds  which mature in we would be required to perform under the guarantee should the joint venture be unable to repay the bonds 
we have recourse provisions in order to recover from the joint venture s assets and the other partner for amounts paid in excess of our proportionate share 
the property collateralizing the bonds is leased and currently generates sufficient cash flow to cover the debt service required by the bond financing 
as a result  no liability has been recorded in our balance sheet

on march   the industrial development authority of the city of kansas city  missouri issued million in non recourse bonds to finance public improvements made by the plaza colonnade  llc joint venture for the benefit of the kansas city missouri public library 
since the joint venture leases the land for the office building from the library  the joint venture was obligated to build certain public improvements 
the net bond proceeds were million and have and will be used for project and debt service costs 
the joint venture has recorded this obligation on its balance sheet 
the bonds are ultimately paid by the tax increment financing revenue generated by the building and its tenants 
in the highwoods dlf dlf  lp joint venture  a single tenant currently leases an entire building under a lease scheduled to expire on june  the tenant also leases space in other buildings owned by us 
in conjunction with an overall restructuring of the tenant s leases with us and with this joint venture  we agreed to certain changes to the lease with the joint venture in september the modifications included allowing the tenant to vacate the premises on january   and reducing the rent obligation by and converting the net lease to a full service lease with the tenant liable for of these costs at that time 
in turn  we agreed to compensate the joint venture for any economic losses incurred as a result of these lease modifications

the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make based on the current leases in place is approximately million as of december  the likelihood of us paying on our million guarantee is remote since the joint ventures currently satisfy the minimum debt coverage ratio and should we be required to pay our portion of the guarantee  we would recover the million from other joint venture assets

the other partner contributed million of cash and a new loan was obtained by the partnership for million 
in connection with this disposition  we entered into a master lease agreement with harborview lp for five years on the then vacant space in the building approximately of the building  occupancy was at december  we also guaranteed to harborview lp the payment of tenant improvements and lease commissions of million 
our maximum exposure to loss under the master lease agreement was million at september  and was million at december  additionally  our partner in harborview lp was granted the right to put its equity interest in harborview lp to us in exchange for cash at any time during the one year period commencing on september  the value of the equity interest will be determined at the time that such partner elects to exercise its put right  if ever  based upon the then fair market value of harborview lp s assets and liabilities  less  which amount was intended to cover the normal costs of a sale transaction 
because of the put option and the master lease agreement  this transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities and operations related to harborview plaza  the property owned by harborview lp  including any new financing by the partnership  remain on our books 
as a result  we have established a financing obligation equal to the net equity contributed by the other partner 
at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the financing obligation is adjusted to equal the current fair value  which is million at december   but not less than the original financing obligation 
this adjustment is amortized prospectively through september as interest expense on financing obligations

we continue to depreciate the property and record all of the depreciation on our books 
any payments made under the master lease agreement were expensed as incurred million  million and million was expensed during the years ended december   and  respectively and any amounts paid under the tenant improvement and lease commission guarantee are capitalized and amortized to expense over the remaining lease term

table of contents in connection with the sale  we entered into a rental guarantee agreement for each building for the benefit of the buyer to guarantee any shortfalls that may be incurred in the payment of rent and re tenanting costs for a five year period from the date of sale through november 
our maximum exposure to loss under the rental guarantee agreements was million at the date of sale and was million as of december  no payments were made during or in respect of these rent guarantees 
however  in june  we began to make monthly payments to the buyer  at an annual rate of million  as a result of the existing tenant renewing a lease in one building at a lower rental rate 
we expect to make additional payments beginning in june of approximately million per month due to the tenant vacating space in one of the three buildings as of may  these payments will continue until the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or until replacement tenants are in place and paying amounts equal to or more than the current tenant 
these rent guarantees are a form of continuing involvement as discussed in paragraph of sfas no 
because the guarantees cover the entire space occupied by a single tenant under a triple net lease arrangement  our guarantees are considered a guaranteed return on the buyer s investment for an extended period of time 
therefore  the transaction has been accounted for as a financing transaction following the accounting method described in note to the consolidated financial statements through july see below 
accordingly  through july  the assets  liabilities and operations were included in the consolidated financial statements  and a financing obligation of million was recorded which represented the amount received from the buyer  adjusted for subsequent activity 
the income from the operations of the properties  other than depreciation  was allocated to the owner as interest expense on financing obligations 
payments made under the rent guarantees were charged to expense as incurred 
this transaction was recorded as a completed sale transaction in july when the maximum exposure to loss under the guarantees became less than the related deferred gain  accordingly  million in gain was recognized in and additional gain will be recognized in and as the maximum exposure under the guarantees is reduced 
payments made under rent guarantees after july are recorded as a reduction of the deferred gain

interest rate hedging activities to meet  in part  our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is adjusted at one and three month intervals  subject to settlements under these interest rate hedge contracts 
we also enter into treasury lock agreements from time to time in order to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates with respect to future debt offerings 
the interest rate swap that matured on june  was not renewed or extended 
we currently have no outstanding interest rate hedge contracts 
as further described below under related party transactions  we had an embedded derivative as part of the land purchase arrangement with gapi  inc that expired in august upon closing of the final land parcel under the arrangement

we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
expenditures directly related to the leasing of properties are included in deferred leasing costs and are stated at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
we capitalize initial direct costs related to our leasing efforts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
internal leasing costs include primarily compensation  benefits and other costs such as legal fees related to leasing activities that are incurred in connection with successfully securing leases on the properties 
capitalized leasing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated lives of the respective leases 
estimated costs related to unsuccessful activities are expensed as incurred 
if our assumptions regarding the successful efforts of leasing are incorrect  the resulting adjustments could impact earnings 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets such as land  buildings and tenant improvements  intangible assets such as above and below market leases  acquired in place leases and other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair values 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates as well as available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above and below market leases acquired are recorded at their fair value 
fair value is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and any below market option periods 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to its contractual expiration date  any unamortized balance is adjusted through rental revenue 

table of contents the value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider tenant improvements  leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses 
the value of in place leases is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to its contractual expiration date  any unamortized balance of its related intangible asset is expensed 
the value of a tenant relationship is based on our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered include the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of a tenant relationship is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods defined in the respective leases 
based on our acquisitions since the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we have deemed tenant relationships to be immaterial and have not allocated any amounts to this intangible asset 
we will evaluate these items in future transactions 
real estate and leasehold improvements are classified as long lived assets held for sale or as long lived assets to be held for use 
real estate is classified as held for sale when the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  are satisfied  this determination requires management to make estimates and assumptions  including assessing the probability that potential sales transactions may or may not occur 
actual results could differ from those assumptions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value 
fair value of assets held for sale is equal to the estimated or contracted sales price with a potential buyer less costs to sell 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
with respect to assets classified as held for use  if events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant decline in occupancy and change in use  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired  an impairment analysis is performed 
such analysis consists of determining whether the asset s carrying amount will be recovered from its undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows 
these cash flows are estimated based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property 
if the carrying amount of a held for use asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the asset and the net carrying amount 
we generally estimate the fair value of assets held for use by using discounted cash flow analysis  in some instances  appraisal information may be available and is used in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis 
as the factors used in generating these cash flows are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the discounted and or undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows estimated by us in our impairment analyses or those established by appraisal may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize future impairment losses on our properties held for sale and held for use 
sales of real estate we account for sales of real estate in accordance with sfas no 
for sales transactions meeting the requirements of sfas no 
for full profit recognition  the related assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet and the resultant gain or loss is recorded in the period the transaction closes 
for sales transactions that do not meet the criteria for full profit recognition  we account for the transactions in accordance with the methods specified in sfas no 
for sales transactions with continuing involvement after the sale  if the continuing involvement with the property is limited by the terms of the sales contract  profit is recognized at the time of sale and is reduced by the maximum exposure to loss related to the nature of the continuing involvement 
sales to entities in which we have an interest are accounted for in accordance with partial sale accounting provisions as set forth in sfas no 
for sales transactions that do not meet sale criteria as set forth in sfas no 
 we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement  including put and call provisions  if present  and account for the transaction as a financing arrangement  profit sharing arrangement or other alternate method of accounting rather than as a sale  based on the nature and extent of the continuing involvement 
some transactions may have numerous forms of continuing involvement 
in those cases  we determine which method is most appropriate based on the substance of the transaction 

table of contents if we have an obligation to repurchase the property at a higher price or at a future indeterminable value such as fair market value  or we guarantee the return of the buyer s investment or a return on that investment for an extended period  we account for such transaction as a financing transaction 
if we have an option to repurchase the property at a higher price and it is likely we will exercise this option  the transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction 
for transactions treated as financings  we record the amounts received from the buyer as a financing obligation and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded on our books 
the results of operations of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  will be reflected as interest expense on the financing obligation 
if the transaction includes an obligation or option to repurchase the asset at a higher price  additional interest is recorded to accrete the liability to the repurchase price 
for options or obligations to repurchase the asset at fair market value at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the liability is adjusted to equal the current fair value to the extent fair value exceeds the original financing obligation 
the corresponding debit or credit will be recorded to a related discount account and the revised debt discount is amortized over the expected term until termination of the option or obligation 
if it is unlikely such option will be exercised  the transaction is accounted for under the deposit method or profit sharing method 
if we have an obligation or option to repurchase at a lower price  the transaction is accounted for as a leasing arrangement 
at such time as these repurchase obligations expire  a sale will be recorded and gain recognized 
if we retain an interest in the buyer and provide certain rent guarantees or other forms of support where the maximum exposure to loss exceeds the gain  we account for such transaction as a profit sharing arrangement 
for transactions treated as profit sharing arrangements  we record a profit sharing obligation for the amount of equity contributed by the other partner and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded on our books 
the results of operations of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  will be allocated to the other partner for their percentage interest and reflected as co venture expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in future periods  a sale is recorded and profit is recognized when the remaining maximum exposure to loss is reduced below the amount of gain deferred 
properties that are sold or classified as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions of paragraph of fasb statement no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations  effective beginning in provided that the operations and cash flows of the property will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property after it is sold 
interest expense is included in discontinued operations if the related loan securing the sold property is paid off or assumed by the buyer in connection with the sale 
if the property is sold to a joint venture in which we retain an interest  the property will not be accounted for as a discontinued operation due to our significant ongoing interest in the operations through our joint venture interest 
if we are retained to provide property management  leasing and or other services for the property owner after the sale  the property generally will be accounted for as discontinued operations because the expected cash flows related to these management and leasing activities will generally not be significant in comparison to the cash flows from the property prior to sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating cost recoveries due from tenants as well as accrued straight line rents receivable 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and considering such factors as the credit quality of our tenant  historical trends of the tenant and or other debtor  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
additionally  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  we estimate the expected recovery through bankruptcy claims and increase the allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible 
if our assumptions regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable and accrued straight line rents receivable prove incorrect  we could experience write offs of accounts receivable or accrued straight line rents receivable in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
property operating expense recoveries we receive additional rent from tenants in the form of property operating cost recoveries or cost reimbursements which are determined on a lease by lease basis 
the most common types of cost reimbursements in our leases are common area maintenance cam and real estate taxes  where the tenant pays a share of operating and administrative expenses and real estate taxes  as determined in each lease 

table of contents the computation of such additional rent due from tenants is complex and involves numerous judgments  including the interpretation of terms and other tenant lease provisions 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computations 
many tenants make monthly fixed payments of cam  real estate taxes and other cost reimbursement items 
we record these payments as income each month 
we also make adjustments  positive or negative  to cost recovery income to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements 
after the end of the calendar year  we compute each tenant s final cost reimbursements and  after considering amounts paid by the tenant during the year  issue a bill or credit for the appropriate amount to the tenant 
the differences between the amounts billed less previously received payments and the accrual adjustment are recorded as increases or decreases to cost recovery income when the final bills are prepared  usually beginning in march and completed by mid year 
the net amounts of any such adjustments have not been material in the years presented 
funds from operations we believe that ffo and ffo per share are beneficial to management and investors and are important indicators of the performance of any equity reit 
because ffo and ffo per share calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  management believes that the use of ffo and ffo per share  together with the required gaap presentations  provide a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing and investing activities 
ffo and ffo per share as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo and ffo per share as described below 
however  you should be aware that ffo and ffo per share are non gaap financial measures and therefore do not represent net income or net income per share as defined by gaap 
net income and net income per share as defined by gaap are the most relevant measures in determining our operating performance because ffo and ffo per share include adjustments that investors may deem subjective  such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
furthermore  ffo per share does not depict the amount that accrues directly to the stockholders benefit 
accordingly  ffo and ffo per share should never be considered as alternatives to net income or net income per share as indicators of our operating performance 
our calculation of ffo  which we believe is consistent with the calculation of ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and which appropriately excludes the cost of capital improvements and related capitalized interest  is as follows net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  less dividends to holders of preferred stock and less excess of preferred stock redemption cost over carrying value  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  less gains  or plus losses  from sales of depreciable operating properties but excluding impairment losses and excluding items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus minority interest  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis  and plus or minus adjustments for depreciation and amortization and gains losses on sales and minority interest related to discontinued operations 

table of contents other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo and ffo per share for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts amount per share amount per share amount per share funds from operations net income dividends to preferred shareholders excess of preferred stock redemption cost over carrying value net income applicable to common shareholders add deduct depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties minority interest from the operating partnership in income from operations unconsolidated affiliates depreciation and amortization of real estate assets discontinued operations depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties minority interest from the operating partnership in income from discontinued operations funds from operations dividend payout data dividends paid per common share common unit as a percentage of funds from operations weighted average shares outstanding includes assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future effects  but only indicators of reasonably possible effects 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
we had no interest rate hedge contracts in effect at december  as of december   we had approximately  million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
the estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt at december  was approximately  million 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would increase by approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower during the months ended december   our interest expense would be increased or decreased approximately million
