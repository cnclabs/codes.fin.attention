item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our audited financial statements and the related notes thereto 
overview we primarily invest in single tenant properties under long term leases to the us government  state governments  local governments  and government sponsored enterprises 
we are a self managed  self administered company that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit 
we believe that we are the only public company focused solely on investing in government leased properties 
our business consists of buying  owning and managing recently built or renovated office properties primarily leased  under long term leases  to the federal government  acting through the general services administration gsa  the federal government s property management arm 
our portfolio consisted of nineteen properties totaling approximately million rentable square feet as of december  these properties are occupied and have a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately years 
our largest tenants  as a percentage of total leased square feet  as of december  were percentage of agency tenant square feet bureau of public debt us army corps of engineers social security administration internal revenue service food and drug administration we own each of our properties through separate wholly owned entities 
we intend to expand our portfolio by acquiring additional government leased properties 
the credit worthiness of our governmental tenants enables us to use debt to finance a higher percentage of the acquisition cost of the properties we buy 
our total debt represented of the historical cost of our assets at the end of we intend to continue financing future acquisitions with a combination of cash  common stock  long term fixed rate debt and short term credit lines 
we intend to use our credit lines to finance acquisitions and deposits on a short term basis 
our objective is to finance each property with long term fixed rate debt whose maturity matches or exceeds  to the extent possible  the remaining term of the lease 
this strategy minimizes interest rate risk and should result in more consistent and reliable cash flow 
leases for governmental tenants vary widely and include net leases  gross leases and modified gross leases 
net leases require the tenant to pay all operating expenses  gross leases require the landlord to pay all operating expenses  and modified gross leases require the landlord and the tenant each to pay a portion of the operating expenses 
we intend to acquire properties with all three types of leases  as well as variations of these leases  because we believe that gross leases and modified gross leases may provide higher returns for us than net leases 
in our experience  gsa leases are generally modified gross leases 
we plan to mitigate the higher risk of gross leases and modified gross leases through strict underwriting  due diligence and intensive property management 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for acquired properties 
differences between rental revenue earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements are credited or charged  as applicable  to deferred rent receivables which is included in tenant receivables on the consolidated balance sheets 
rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as rent received in advance which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
our leases are generally only subject to annual inflation increases over the term of the lease for a portion of the rent due 
our leases generally contain provisions under which 
table of contents the tenants reimburse us for real estate taxes incurred by us over a specified base amount 
such amounts are recognized as tenant reimbursements revenue in the period in which the real estate tax expenses over the specified base amount are incurred 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to rent  expense reimbursements and other revenue 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant credit worthiness  geographic concentrations and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 
real estate we record real estate at depreciated cost 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
all development projects and related carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the consolidated balance sheet as real estate under development 
as each project is completed and becomes available for lease  the total cost of the project is depreciated over the estimated useful life 
interest and personnel support cost directly related to the development are capitalized as part of the real estate under development to the extent that such charges do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net realizable value 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and improvements  five to seven years for equipment and fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements  tenant origination costs and intangible lease costs 
we must estimate the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
our cash flow estimate considers factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if an impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we allocate a portion of the purchase price to above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
in the case of below market leases  we consider the remaining contractual lease period 
table of contents and renewal periods  taking into consideration the likelihood of the tenant exercising its renewal options 
the capitalized above market lease values which would be presented as lease intangibles in the consolidated balance sheets would be amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values which would be presented as deferred income would be amortized as an addition to rental income over the remaining contractual lease period and any renewal periods included in the valuation analysis 
we currently have no above market or below market leases 
we also assume that our at market rate tenants would not exercise any early terminations clauses in determining the value allocated to their lease or the amortization of the related lease costs 
if a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged to expense 
we allocate a portion of the purchase to the value of leases acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize independent appraisals or our estimates to determine the respective in place lease values 
our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods 
we also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price to in place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value 
characteristics we consider in allocating these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
we currently have the us government as our major tenant  but have not yet developed a relationship that we would consider to have any current intangible value 
the value of in place leases presented as tenant origination costs in the consolidated balance sheets is amortized to expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases 
the value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the remaining initial term  including any renewal periods included in the valuation analysis for the respective leases considered in our valuation analysis  but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the tenant origination costs and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
amounts allocated to tangible land  building  tenant improvements  equipment and fixtures are based on independent appraisals or our own analysis of comparable properties in the existing portfolio 
derivative instruments the company measures derivative instruments at fair value and records them as an asset or liability  depending on the company s rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
for derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income oci and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the affected period

in may  the company entered into two forward starting interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to fix a portion of the interest rate associated with the anticipated issuance of future financings that are expected to occur in the second half of the period of time over which the company expects to hedge its continued exposure to variability in future cash flows for the forecasted transactions is approximately ten months 
we entered into a million revolving credit facility in november led by wachovia capital markets  llc 
wachovia bank  na serves as administrative agent 
this credit facility replaced the company s prior million revolving credit agreement led by first national bank of omaha which also is participating in the new credit facility 
the term of the credit facility is for three years and may be extended for one additional year 
the amount available to be borrowed under the credit facility is based upon the combined value of certain collateral properties 
the initial pool of collateral includes the niagara center  buffalo ssa and mineral wells bpd properties 
the credit facility will provide us funding for future acquisitions and facilitate additional capitalization 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a a base rate determined by the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of  or b an applicable margin  based upon our total indebtedness to total asset value  plus libor 
the initial borrowings on the credit facility are priced at libor plus 
payments are interest only through the term of the credit facility and are payable at least quarterly 
the credit facility is guaranteed by us and collateralized by our mineral wells bpd  buffalo niagara center and buffalo ssa properties 
the credit facility contains financial covenants related to maintenance of leverage  fixed charge coverage ratios and tangible net worth and also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  level of cash dividends and other transactions as defined in the agreement 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties  the costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue and dividend payments to stockholders 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  sales of equity securities  and long term mortgage indebtedness 
certain of our fixed rate mortgages require that fully funded sinking fund reserves be established and maintained for future capital expenditures related to capital repairs  marketing  tenant improvements or leasing commissions 
we periodically evaluate requirements for future capital expenditures on our properties not covered by mortgage reserve fund provisions 
our intention is and has been to have a funded reserve for such situations available at the time the capital expenditure is expected to be incurred 
we believe that our net cash provided by operating activities  draws under our revolving line of credit and proceeds from other financing sources that we expect to be available to us will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs during the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  less than after year years years years total mortgage notes payable fixed rate we intend to refinance our mortgage notes payable as they become due or repay them if the related property is being sold 
total interest paid on the mortgage notes payable were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be treated as a reit under the federal tax laws commencing as of our taxable year beginning january  to qualify as a reit  we must  among other things  distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on taxable income we distribute in accordance with the federal tax laws and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income  ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the federal tax laws and applicable regulations thereunder 
we intend to pay to our stockholders  within the time periods prescribed by the federal tax laws in our case by january of the following year  all or substantially all of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on sale of securities 
we will continue our policy of making sufficient cash distributions to stockholders for us maintain reit status under the federal tax laws and to avoid corporate income and excise tax on undistributed income 
all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors and depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
inflation our gsa leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions increase rental rates during the terms of the leases by indexed escalations based on the consumer price index 
in addition  our gsa leases generally require the tenant to pay a share of increases in operating expenses and all increases in real estate taxes 
this may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
however  increases in property operating costs above the escalation amount would harm our cash flow and may harm our ability to pay dividends 
funds from operations reit analysts generally consider funds from operations or ffo an alternative measure of performance for an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines funds from operations as net income  computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs  which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and between other equity reits 
investors should review ffo along with gaap net income available for common shares and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with 
table of contents standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than us 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of gaap to our funds from operations for the periods presented net loss adjustments to reconcile to funds from operations gain from disposal of property real estate depreciation and amortization a funds from operations funds from operations per common share weighted average common shares outstanding a excludes depreciation of non real estate assets of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
market risk related to fixed rate debt as of december   our debt included fixed rate mortgage notes with a carrying value of million 
changes in market interest rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair market value of the debt  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow 
the sensitivity analysis related to our fixed debt assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair market value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million at december  as of december   our derivatives  comprised of two forward starting interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of million  had a carrying value of  included in other assets 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in an asset of approximately million  a change of million in the fair market value of the derivatives at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an accounts payable and accrued liability of approximately million  a change of million in the fair market value of the derivatives at december
