item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
except for the historical matters contained herein  statements made in this annual report are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for intangible assets 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review intangible assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  during the company s fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or sooner  if events indicate a potential impairment 
the identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets involves the estimation of the fair value of the related asset 
the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about discounted expected future cash flows 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions 
allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant most of our unrelated us department store customers the right to return product which does not sell through to consumers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
it is generally after the specific gift giving season mother s day  christmas  etc 
that our customers request approval of the return for unsold items 
we decide to accept returns on a case by case basis 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the provision for returns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  if actual returns received exceeds estimates  reducing net income or increasing net lo ss 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectable accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
inventory write downs 
we record inventory write downs for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  or changes in consumer preferences  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
property held for sale 
we consider property to be held for sale when management and the board of directors approve and commit to a formal plan to actively market and dispose of the property 
upon designation as held for sale  the carrying value of the property is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
we cease to record depreciation expense at that time 
the asset  as well as any borrowings related thereto  is classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
if warranted  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination 
stock based compensation 
we account for our compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is required in order to show our net income as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure 
this information is contained in note u to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to our plans at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
currently  companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
as discussed above  we have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas no 
r  however  in adopting sfas n r  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption used by us continues to be available 
sfas no 
r will be effective for the company beginning with the year starting april  transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts that have been included in the footnotes 
we have decided to adopt prospectively  and will continue to utilize the current black scholes option pricing model 
there were no unvested options or warrants outstanding at march   and as such  the result of adopting sfas no 
r on april  was not material to our results of operations or financial position 
see note u to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effect for the each of the years presented  using our existing valuation and amortization assumptions 
since april we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies 
the policy relating to property held for sale was established in connection with the proposed sale of the sunrise facility 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncement in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
apb no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
in contrast  sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
in addition  sfas makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas is effective for acc ounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
significant trends over the last few years  a significant number of new prestige fragrance products have been introduced on a worldwide basis 
the beauty industry in general is highly competitive and consumer preferences often change rapidly 
the initial appeal of these new fragrances  launched for the most part in us department stores  has fueled the growth of our industry 
department stores continue to lose sales to the mass market as a product matures 
to counter the effect of lower department store sales  companies are required to introduce new products more quickly  which requires additional spending for development and advertising and promotional expenses 
in addition  a number of the new launches are with celebrities either entertainers or athletes which require substantial royalty commitments and whose careers and or appeal could change drastically  both positively and negatively  based on a single event 
we believe these trends will continue 
if one or more of our new product introductions would be unsuccessful  or the appeal of the celebrity would diminish  it could result in a substantial reduction in profitability and operating cash flows 
in addition  certain us department store retailers have recently consolidated operations resulting in the closing of retail doors as well as implementing various inventory control initiatives 
we expect that these store closings and the inventory control initiatives will continue to affect our sales in the short term 
results of operation our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include all of the costs related to their distribution network in costs of goods sold as compared to our allocating only a portion of these distribution costs to costs of goods sold and including the remaining unallocated amounts as selling and distribution expenses 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   net sales increased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was mainly attributable to the continuation of the worldwide launch of paris hilton fragrances for women and men  which commenced shipping in october and april  respectively  coupled with the initial shipment in september of the second paris hilton fragrance for women  just me and december of just me for men  generating  in gross sales for the entire paris hilton fragrance brand during the current year excluding  and  in paris hilton brand watch and handbag sales  respectively as compared to  for the same period in the prior year  the launch of guess women s fragrance during june  and men s fragrance during march  which provided a total of  in g ross sales   in gross sales of xoxo brand products  which license was acquired during january  as compared to gross sales of  during fiscal  and the initial shipments in september of maria sharapova women s fragrance  which provided gross sales of  the increase was partially offset by a reduction in gross sales of ocean pacific op brand products  since no major launches were introduced during the current period pending strategic direction from op s new owner  warnaco  who acquired the op brand during  and a slight reduction in gross sales of perry ellis brand products from  to net sales to unrelated customers increased to  compared to  for the prior year  mainly as a result of increases in paris hilton and guess brand sales discussed above in the amount of  and  respectively  and an increase in perry ellis brand gross sales of  partially offset by the reduction of  in op brand sales 
sales to related parties increased to  compared to  in the prior year  mainly as a result of increases in the amount of  and  in paris hilton and guess brand sales  respectively  partially offset by reductions of  and  in perry ellis and op brand sales  respectively 
we expect that sales growth to unrelated customers in the upcoming fiscal year will continue to outpace those of related customers with the further roll out of our paris hilton and guess fragrance products  which should continue to h ave initially a higher percentage of sales to unrelated customers 
however  the extent of the increases will be limited by the us department store consolidations and their inventory control measures discussed above 
our overall cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to unrelated customers and related parties approximated and  respectively  for the current period  as compared to and  respectively  for the same period in the prior year 
the reduction in cost of goods as a percentage of net sales is due primarily to the shipment of paris hilton and guess products to unrelated parties  including us department stores  where our margins are significantly higher 
as noted below  these improved margins were partially offset by increased in store advertising and promotional spending  both of which we expect to continue 
operating expenses increased by compared to the prior year from  to  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
however  certain individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes as we invested in our new product launches 
advertising and promotional expenses more than doubled to  compared to  in the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the current year includes approximately  and  of promotional costs in connection with the continued roll out of paris hilton fragrances for women and men and the guess women s and men s fragrance launches  respectively  which substantially exceed required promotional spending under these two license agreements 
we anticipate that increased promotional spending for these two brands will continue at these levels during periods which co ntain new product launches 
selling and distribution costs increased to  compared to  in the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to additional costs for temporary warehouse storage space to handle the increased order flow and inventory requirements  coupled with an increase in domestic sales headcount and travel expenses to support the increased sales in this distribution channel 
general and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year  from  to  while decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to increases in audit and professional fees in connection with the first year of sarbanes oxley implementation  health and property insurance  and personnel additions in package development  quality assurance and production planning 
depreciation and amortization increased during the current year from  to  a full year s amortization of intangibles relating to the january xoxo license acquisition see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion was offset by a reduction in depreciation for certain fully depreciated molds and equipment 
royalties increased in the current period from  to  increasing from to of net sales  in line with license requirements for the current sales mix and minimum royalties for certain brands 
as a result of the above factors  operating income increased to  or of net sales for the current year  compared to  or of net sales for the prior year 
net interest expense was  in the current period as compared to net interest income of  for the same period in the prior year as we used our line of credit to finance the increase in receivables and inventory in support of our continuing sales growth 
income before taxes for the current year was  compared to  in the prior year 
giving effect to the tax provision  which reflects an effective rate of approximately  we earned net income of  or of net sales for the current year compared to  or of net sales in the prior year 
the approximate reduction from the effective income tax rate in the prior year was mainly attributable to the increase in international sales activity  resulting in additional foreign source income excludable for federal income tax purposes 
this tax benefit has been phased out for the year ending march   replaced by new provisions based on manufacturing criteria 
we are currently analyzing the new tax law  but have not as yet concluded on its applicability to the company 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   net sales increased to  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was mainly attributable to  the introduction of our new paris hilton fragrance  which commenced shipping in november and achieved gross sales of  the launch of blue for men and women in september  coupled with the full distribution of products launched in the prior year  resulted in an increase of  in total perry ellis brand sales from  to  and   in gross sales of xoxo brand products  which license was acquired during january the increase was partially offset by a reduction in gross sales of chaleur d animale and fred hayman indigo brand products of  and  respectively 
see note c to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the animale and fred hayman brands 
net sales to unrelated customers increased to  compared to  for the prior year  mainly as a result of the paris hilton brand sales discussed above  as  of such sales were made to unrelated customers 
sales to related parties increased to  compared to  for the prior year  mainly as a result of the perry ellis brand increase offset by the reduction in animale and fred hayman brand products  discussed above 
our overall cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales to for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales to unrelated customers and related parties approximated and  respectively  for the current year  as compared to for both groups during the prior year 
for the prior two fiscal years  the cost of goods sold to unrelated customers increased  and consequently gross margins decreased  due to a higher percentage of value sets being sold 
value sets  which include multiple products  have a higher cost of goods compared to basic stock items 
the prior year included a higher percentage of value set sales to unrelated customers 
additionally  the current year sales of paris hilton brand products included a higher percentage of basic stock items 
for the near future  we anticipate the percentage of value sets sold to unrelated customers will remain constant and that the overall cost of goods sold to unrelated customers will also remain relatively constant 
operating expenses increased by compared to the prior year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
however  individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes 
advertising and promotional expenses increased to  compared to  in the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the current year includes approximately  of promotional costs for the recently introduced paris hilton fragrance 
selling and distribution costs increased to  in the current year compared to  for the prior year  remaining relatively constant at of net sales 
the increase was mainly attributable to additional costs for temporary warehouse employees and warehouse storage space to handle the increased order flow  coupled with increases in salaries and health insurance costs for sales and wareho use personnel 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly compared to the prior year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in legal and other professional fees and non recurring charitable contributions  offset by increases in salaries  health insurance costs and bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization increased by during the current year from  to  amortization of intangibles of approximately  relating to the january xoxo license acquisition see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion were offset by a reduction in depreciation  as molds used in production for certain ocean pacific brand products became fully depreciated 
royalties decreased by in the current year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the prior year included approximately  in minim um royalties payable under the jockey license agreement  which were no longer required 
the jockey license expired on december  and was not renewed 
as a result of the above factors  operating income increased to  or of net sales for the current year  compared to  or of net sales for the prior year 
net interest income was  as compared to net interest expense of  for the prior year 
we did not borrow during the current year and invested our excess cash in money market deposit accounts 
income before taxes for the current year was  compared to  in the prior year 
giving effect to the tax provision  we earned net income of  or of net sales for the current year compared to  or of net sales in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to  as of march   compared to  at fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the current period s net income partially offset by the approximate million unfinanced portion of the sunrise facility and the purchase of treasury stock discussed below 
during the year ended march   net cash used in operating activities was  compared to  provided by operating activities during the prior year 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the increase in trade receivables and inventory to support the increased sales generated from the paris hilton and guess brands  offset by the increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities increased from  to  in the current year  due to the release of approximately  of restricted cash resulting from our full pay down on our credit facility in the prior year  the re establishment of  restricted cash pending transfer to our lender as of march  and the purchase of the sunrise facility for  in addition  collection of  of notes receivable from unrelated parties  in accordance with their terms  occurred during the prior year  as well as payments totaling  in connection with the xoxo acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities was  compared to a use of  in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to the drawdown of  under our line of credit to partially finance the increase in trade accounts receivable and inventory discussed above and the  mortgage on the sunrise facility  offset by an additional  of treasury stock purchases during the current year compared to the prior year 
as of march  and  our ratios of the number of days sales in accounts receivable and number of days cost of sales in inventory  on an annualized basis  were as follows march  trade accounts receivable unrelated related perfumania other related total inventories calculated on gross trade receivables excluding allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and advertising allowances of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in the number of days from to for unrelated customers was mainly attributable to the increase in sales to international distributors whose terms  for the most part  range from to days 
based on current circumstances  we anticipate the number of days for the unrelated customer group will range between and days during fiscal the number of days sales in trade receivables from perfumania  inc perfumania continue to exceed those of unrelated customers  due mainly to their seasonal cash flow see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our relationship with perfumania 
we are currently discussing with perfumania their anticipated payments for the upcoming financial year which management expects will reduce their trade receivable balance and the number of days outstanding by march  the number of days sales in trade receivables from other related parties continue to be less than their or day payment terms 
the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days  requires us to maintain a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit  we frequently produce a six to nine month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
we believe that the gross margins on our products outweigh the additional carrying costs 
due to the significant number of new product launches during the fiscal year  the number of days sales in inventory has increased 
the increase in the number of days from to would have been reduced by days if approximately million and million of inventory related to guess for men and paris hilton brand watches  respectively  which products are just launching  were excluded 
as of december   we had repurchased  under all phases of our common stock buy back program  a total of  shares at a cost of  on february   we received approval from our lender to purchase an additional  shares not to exceed  which was ratified on february   by our board of directors the board 
as of march   we repurchased  in the open market  an additional  shares at a cost of  under this approval 
on august   the board approved the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including approval from our lender  which was subsequently received  for up to  on august  as of march   we had repurchased  in the open market   shares at a cost of  including  shares at a cost of  during the period april  through march  on july   we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with gmac commercial credit llc gmaccc 
on january   the loan agreement was extended through july  under the loan agreement  we were able to borrow  depending upon the availability of a borrowing base  on a revolving basis  up to  at an interest rate of libor plus or the bank of new york s prime rate  at our option 
on january   the loan agreement was amended  increasing the loan amount to  with an additional  available at our option  while extending the maturity to july  the interest was reduced to libor plus or 
below the prime rate 
during may  we exercised our option and increased the line to  at march   based on the borrowing base at that date  the credit line amounted to  of which  was outstanding 
accordingly  we had  available under the credit line 
restricted cash represents collections of trade accounts receivable deposited with our bank and pending transfer to gmaccc 
as of march    was on deposit with our bank pending transfer 
substantially all of our assets  other than the sunrise facility  collateralize our credit line borrowing 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default and covenants which prohibit  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying dividends  creating liens  and engaging in mergers and acquisitions without the prior consent of gmaccc 
the loan agreement also contains certain financial covenants relating to net worth  interest coverage and other financial ratios  which we were in compliance with 
on december   we obtained a  mortgage loan from ge finance business property corporation for the sunrise facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the mortgage was repaid in connection with the june  sale of the property 
in connection with our new distribution facility in new jersey  we anticipate purchasing equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million  the majority of which will be financed through capital leases over a month period 
management believes that funds from operations and our existing financing will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs 
however  if we were to expand operations through acquisitions  new licensing arrangements or both  we may need to obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that we could obtain such financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of march  in s for the year ending march  type of obligation thereafter total operating lease obligations mortgage payable on property held for sale line of credit purchase obligations advertising obligations other long term obligations included in as the sunrise facility was sold on june   and the mortgage was repaid 
represents purchase orders issued in the normal course of business for components  raw materials and promotional supplies 
consists of advertising commitments under our licensing agreements 
these amounts were calculated based on the guaranteed minimum sales goals  as set forth in the agreements 
unlike guaranteed minimum royalties  advertising and promotional spending are based on a percentage of actual net sales  and are not contractually required if there are no sales 
see note b to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these amounts 
consists of guaranteed minimum royalty requirements under our licensing agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in regulation s k item a 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with the exception of canada  we sell our products worldwide with all such sales being denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we are not at risk to foreign exchange translation exposure  other than with our canadian distributor where we assume such risk 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded foreign exchange gains losses of  and  respectively  relating to sales collection activity with our canadian distributor 
we believe a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and canadian dollar would not have a material effect on our consolidated statement of income 
we could  however  be subject to changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we are represented internationally 
we closely monitor such conditions and are able  for the most part  to adjust our sales strategies accordingly 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our bank line of credit 
the bank line of credit bears interest at a variable rate  as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources 
we mitigate interest rate risk by continuously monitoring the interest rates and electing the lower of the fixed rate libor or prime rate option available under the line of credit 
when borrowing for our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
as of march  and  the primary source of funds for working capital and other needs was our million line of credit million in 
the line of credit bears interest at a floating rate of prime less 
we believe a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates would increase future annual interest expense by approximately million
