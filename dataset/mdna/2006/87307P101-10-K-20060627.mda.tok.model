item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
this document contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
tvia s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in customer demand  risks associated with competition  risks associated with product development  reliance on foreign manufacturers  foreign business  political and economic risks and risks identified in the company s securities and exchange commission  filings  including  but not limited to  those discussed elsewhere in this form k under the heading risk factors located in item a  of this form k 
overview we design  develop and market display processors for the interactive television market as well as a family of flexible  high quality display processors tailored to the asia pacific television manufacturers creating next generation digital lcd  hd  and progressive scan televisions 
we currently offer three product families the trueview family  introduced in calendar year  the trueview family  introduced in calendar year  and the cyberpro family  introduced in calendar year these product families currently generate most of our revenues 
we sell our products through two channels 
first  we sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and recognize revenues at the time of shipment to these oems 
second  we sell our products to a number of distributors 
revenue from product sales to distributors occurs only when the distributor can identify the end user and the distributor places a purchase order to the company identifying the end user and assures shipment to that user 
historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have accounted for a significant portion of our product sales 
in fiscal  sales to shenzhen ricom industrial development co  ltd  micro network korea co  ltd  sharp trading corporation and univeral technology represented   and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  sales to sms electronics  ltd  kanematsu devices corporation and micro network korea co  ltd 
represented  and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  sales to kanematsu devices corporation  sms electronics  ltd  weikeng industrial co  and fujitsu siemens computers gmbh represented   and of revenues  respectively 
various factors have affected and may continue to affect our gross margin 
these factors include  but are not limited to  our product mix  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  yields and the mix of our product sales and development contracts and other revenues 
for example  newly introduced products generally have higher average selling prices and generate higher gross margins 
both average selling prices and the related gross margins typically decline over product life cycles due to competitive pressures and volume price agreements 
our gross margin and operating results in the future may continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range from two months to six months or more  plus an additional three to six months or more before an oem customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products  if ever 
due to these lengthy sales cycles  we may experience a delay between incurring operating expenses and inventory costs and the generation of revenues from design wins 
we have sustained operating losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses resulted from significant costs incurred in the planning and development of our technology and services and from significant marketing costs 
we anticipate higher revenues for at least the next several quarters as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year  due to an expected increase in demand in the digital television market 
we have a subsidiary in the  people s republic of china with offices in hefei that perform final production tests  research and development and logistics support and offices in shenzhen and beijing that provide sales and complete system support including design and integration to our customers 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  valuation of inventories  impairment of long lived assets  and stock based compensation valuation assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenues 
end users sales we recognize revenue from product sales to end users when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  which is generally at the time of shipment 
distributor sales revenue from product sales to distributors occurs only when the distributor can identify the end user and the distributor places a purchase order to tvia identifying the end user and ensures shipment to that end user 
the sale must be evidenced by persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  which is generally at the time of shipment 
on a discretionary basis the company may extend payment terms in excess of ninety days to credit worthy customers or distributors 
it is the company s sales policy to ship to distributors only when an end user customer is defined and the shipment date confirmed 
in accordance with these requirements the distributor does not hold inventory 
the company does not recognize customer acceptance criteria 
if these criteria are included in the arrangement  then the company will not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements or significant obligations are completed 
if the company launches a new product  the revenue is deferred until the new product is integrated and accepted by the first time customer s for that product 
in response to competitive market conditions  the company offers incentive programs common to the semiconductor industry 
accruals for estimated distributor incentives or commissions are established at the time of sale based on the terms of the incentive program 
revenue from development contracts non recurring engineering agreements or nre is deferred and recognized as revenue upon achievement of nre milestones 
nre revenue occurs infrequently and is generally insignificant when compared to semi conductor revenue 
receivables 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
as part of the estimation process  we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
if circumstances indicate that a customer balance is ultimately uncollectible it is written off against the allowance account 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and include materials  labor and overhead 
allowances  when required  are made to reduce carrying values of inventories to their estimated net realizable values 
the write down of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value that is based upon assumptions about future demand and market 
table of contents conditions 
these assumptions are based on our analysis of various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience and current market and economic conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we perform an impairment assessment when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value 
once written down  amounts are not adjusted until the asset is sold or scrapped 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long live assets could be required 
stock based compensation expense 
effective april   the company early adopted sfas no 
r which revises sfas and supersedes apb sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant 
with regards to the stock option plan  the company elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted shares beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
with regards to the sars stock appreciation rights plan fas r requires cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption  remeasuring all vested awards at fair value from the inception of the plan 
the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with the company s valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  under sfas r 
the company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
for all unvested options outstanding as of april   the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense  based on the fair value at the original grant date  is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining vesting period 
for share based payments granted subsequent to april   compensation expense  based on the fair value on the date of grant  is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of grant

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of voluntary changes in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period s financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless impracticable 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting change apb  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect correction of an error 
sfas carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas applies to voluntary changes in accounting principle that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on its financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in inventory cost 
further  sfas requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to product costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company s current accounting methods comply with sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
the provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  sfas eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is  transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity 
the company believes that its current practice approximates these requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative discussion of market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage the exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio and we presently invest entirely in short term  investment grade  government and corporate securities 
these securities are highly liquid and generally mature within months from the purchase date 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we have performed an analysis to assess the potential effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of any change in foreign currency exchange rates is not expected to be material to our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate basis points change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk we are an international company  selling our products globally and  in particular  in japan  korea  the people s republic of china and taiwan 
although we transact our business in united states dollars  we cannot assure you that future fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar will not affect the competitiveness of our products  gross profits realized  and results of operations 
further  we incur expenses in the people s republic of china  taiwan and other countries that are denominated in currencies other than united states dollars 
we cannot estimate the effect that an immediate basis points change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our future operating results or cash flows as a direct result of changes in exchange rates 
however  we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any derivative financial instruments
