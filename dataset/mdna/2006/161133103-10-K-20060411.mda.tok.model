item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below and elsewhere in this report on form k and in our other public filings 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks could also materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
risks related to our business and industry our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends  customer preferences  and other fashion related factors 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly  particularly for women s apparel 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing fashion tastes and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
if we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines  our sales will be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed sales opportunities 
in response  we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow moving inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents existing and increased competition in the women s retail apparel and direct to consumer markets may reduce our net revenues  profits  and market share 
the women s specialty retail apparel and direct to consumer markets are highly competitive 
our competitors include individual and chain fashion specialty stores  department stores  discount stores  catalog retailers  and internet based retailers 
as a result of this competition  we are required to effectively market and competitively price our products to consumers in diverse markets  and we may experience pricing pressures  increased marketing expenditures  and loss of market share  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we believe that the principal bases upon which we compete are merchandise style  size  selection  quality  and price  as well as store location  design  advertising  promotion  and personalized service to our customers 
other women s apparel and direct to consumer companies with greater financial resources  marketing capabilities  or brand recognition may enter the plus size business 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
a slowdown in the united states economy  an uncertain economic outlook  and escalating energy costs could lead to reduced consumer demand for our products in the future 
consumer spending habits  including spending for our products  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salary levels  wage rates  availability of consumer credit  consumer confidence  and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy and an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits and mall traffic  which could result in a reduction in our net sales 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
maintaining and improving our operating margins is dependent on our ability to successfully control our operating costs 
in order to maintain or improve our operating margins  we need to successfully manage our operating costs 
our inability to successfully manage labor costs  increases in costs such as postage and paper  occupancy costs  or other operating costs  or our inability to take advantage of opportunities to reduce operating costs  would adversely affect our operating margins and our results of operations 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our operations at a reasonable cost 
our operating results fluctuate from season to season 
our retail store and direct to consumer operations experience seasonal fluctuations in net sales and consequently in operating income  with peak sales occurring during the easter  labor day  and christmas seasons 
in addition  extreme or unseasonable weather can affect our sales 
any decrease in net sales or margins during our peak selling periods  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months before these periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  including perishable products in certain of our direct to consumer businesses  before the peak selling periods 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory  especially during our peak selling periods  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of the inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to obtain sufficient working capital financing 
our business requires substantial investment in our inventory for a long period before sales occur 
consequently  we require significant amounts of working capital financing 
we depend on the availability of credit to fund our working capital  including credit we receive from our suppliers and their agents  on our credit card securitization program  and on our revolving credit facility 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing at an affordable cost  we might be unable to adequately merchandise our stores  e commerce  or catalog businesses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we face challenges in managing our recent growth 
our operating challenges and management responsibilities are increasing as we continue to grow and expand into additional distribution channels 
successful growth will require that we continue to expand and improve our internal systems and our operations  including our distribution infrastructure 
our business plan depends on our ability to open and operate new retail stores and to convert  where applicable  the formats of existing stores on a profitable basis 
in addition  we will need to identify  hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to work in our stores 
we are also seeking to complete the integration of crosstown traders and our direct to consumer channel into our current operating structure 
growth in our direct to consumer channel is dependent on sufficient response rates to our catalogs and internet websites and access to new customers  which may not occur 
in addition  we plan to continue to build infrastructure in our direct to consumer channel to prepare for the launch of new catalogs  including the launch of the lane bryant catalog in calendar when the lane bryant catalog trademark  currently licensed by a third party  reverts to us 
these objectives have created  and may continue to create  additional pressure on our staff and on our operating systems 
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plan for our retail store and direct to consumer segments  or that we will achieve our objectives as quickly or as effectively as we hope 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
our success and our ability to execute our business strategy depend largely on the efforts and abilities of our chief executive officer  dorrit j 
bern  and her management team 
the loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  as we may not be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
our business plan is largely dependent upon continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market 
our business is primarily focused on sales of plus size women s apparel  which represents a majority of our total net sales 
our operating results could be adversely affected by a lack of continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market 

table of contents we could be materially and adversely affected if any of our distribution or fulfillment centers are shut down 
we operate distribution facilities in greencastle  indiana  and baltimore county  maryland  and we operate catalog fulfillment centers in tucson  arizona  marshfield  wisconsin  stevens point  wisconsin  and wilmington  north carolina 
most of the merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution and fulfillment centers  where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores or to the customer 
if any of our distribution or fulfillment centers were to shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason  the other distribution or fulfillment centers may not be able to adequately support the resulting additional distribution demands  in part because of capacity constraints and in part because each distribution or fulfillment center services a particular brand or brands 
as a result  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores or customers during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the affected distribution or fulfillment center 
natural disasters  war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact the availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
in the event of a natural disaster  war  or acts of terrorism  or if either are threatened  our ability to obtain merchandise for sale in our stores or through our direct to consumer business may be negatively impacted 
a significant portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our net sales and profit margins may be adversely affected 
if commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers  fulfillment centers  stores  or our direct to consumer customers 
in the event of a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the united states  or the threat of either  we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our inability to successfully manage customer service or fulfillment for our e commerce websites or our catalog business could adversely impact our operating results 
successful management of our e commerce and catalog operations is dependent on our ability to maintain efficient and uninterrupted customer service and order fulfillment 
inadequate systems capacity  a disruption or slowdown in telecommunications services  changes in technology  changes in government regulations  systems issues  security breaches  a failure to integrate order management systems  or customer privacy issues could result in reduced sales or increases in operating expenses as a result of our efforts or our inability to remedy such issues 
in addition  we may not be able to hire sufficient qualified associates to support our e commerce or catalog operations during peak periods  especially during the christmas holiday season 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our e commerce or catalog businesses 

table of contents we rely on foreign sources of production 
we purchase a significant portion of our apparel directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
we face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad 
such risks include but are not necessarily limited to political instability  increased security requirements applicable to imported goods  trade restrictions  imposition of  or changes in  duties  quotas  taxes  and other charges on imports  currency and exchange risks  issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards  concerns over anti dumping  delays in shipping  or increased costs of transportation 
new initiatives could be proposed that would have an impact on the trading status of certain countries  and could include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that  if enacted  could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries 
the future performance of our business will depend on our foreign suppliers and may be adversely affected by the factors listed above  all of which are beyond our control 
issues of global workplace conditions may adversely affect our business 
if any one of our manufacturers or vendors fails to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  is perceived by the public as failing to meet certain labor standards in the united states  or employs unfair labor practices  our business could be adversely affected 
current global workplace concerns of the public include perceived low wages  poor working conditions  age of employees  and various other employment standards 
these globalization issues may affect the available supply of certain manufacturers products  which may result in increased costs to us 
furthermore  a negative customer perception of any of our key vendors or their products may result in a lower customer demand for our apparel 
we depend on strip shopping center and mall traffic and our ability to identify suitable store locations for our retail stores segment 
our sales are dependent in part on a high volume of strip shopping center and mall traffic 
strip shopping center and mall traffic may be adversely affected by  among other things  economic downturns  the closing of anchor stores or changes in customer shopping preferences 
a decline in the popularity of strip shopping center or mall shopping among our target customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers  we need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations 
we cannot assure you that desirable store locations will continue to be available 
acquisition of additional store locations is also dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate lease terms for such locations 
in addition  the timely opening of new store locations could be adversely affected by delays in obtaining necessary permits and approvals  lack of availability of construction materials and labor  or work stoppages 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and servicemarks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and servicemarks on a worldwide basis 
we are not aware of any claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks and servicemarks in the united states 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and servicemarks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks  servicemarks and proprietary rights of others 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks and other proprietary rights  and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
other risks anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a change in control 
for example  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that classify our board into three classes  with one class being elected each year  do not permit cumulative voting  permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without shareholder approval  require certain advance notice procedures with regard to the nomination of candidates for election as directors  other than nominations by or at the direction of our board  prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of or more of our voting securities without super majority shareholder or board approval  prevent our directors from being removed without cause except upon super majority shareholder approval  and prevent a holder of or more of our common stock from taking certain actions without certain approvals 
we also have adopted a shareholder rights plan 
this plan may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us  and may discourage open market purchases of our common stock or a non negotiated tender or exchange offer for such stock  and  accordingly  may limit a shareholder s ability to realize a premium over the market price of our common stock in connection with any such transaction 

table of contents failure to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of could adversely affect our business 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to perform periodic assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and to report on the results of our assessments in our quarterly and annual reports to the securities and exchange commission 
our independent registered public accounting firm is required on an annual basis to attest to whether or not our assessment is fairly stated in all material respects and to separately report on whether or not they believe that we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to timely attest to our assessment  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a possible loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
such a failure could result in our inability to provide timely and or reliable financial information and could adversely affect our business 
new accounting rules or regulations or changes in existing rules or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 
changes to existing accounting rules or the adoption of new rules could require us to recognize financial statement effects which could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
changes in estimates related to our property  plant  equipment  or our intangible assets could adversely affect our reported results of operations 
we make certain significant assumptions  estimates  and projections related to the useful lives of our property  plant  and equipment and the valuation of intangible assets related to acquisitions 
the carrying amount and or useful life of these assets are subject to periodic valuation tests for impairment 
impairment results when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the undiscounted or for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the discounted future cash flows associated with the asset 
if actual experience were to differ materially from the assumptions  estimates  and projections used to determine useful lives or the valuation of property  plant  equipment or intangible assets  a write down for impairment of the carrying value of the assets  or acceleration of depreciation or amortization of the assets  could result 
such a write down or acceleration of depreciation or amortization could have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations
