item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a global pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing innovative products for the treatment of hematology and oncology patients 
we have established our own regulatory  development and sales and marketing organizations covering the us  europe and australia 
we have also developed a distributor network to cover the hematology and oncology markets in numerous additional countries throughout europe  the middle east and asia 
to date  we have acquired the rights to six products  including four that are currently marketed or sold on a compassionate use or named patient basis  and two products that are in varying stages of development 
in may  vidaza was approved for marketing in the us and we commenced sales of the product in july pending positive data from an ongoing phase iii iv study expected to be available at the end of  we plan to file for marketing approval in the european union eu in early until vidaza is approved  we intend to sell vidaza on a compassionate use and named patient basis throughout the major markets in the eu we have filed in europe for approval to market vidaza in certain international markets and these submissions are under review by the respective regulatory authorities 
thalidomide pharmion mg tm is being sold by us on a compassionate use or named patient basis in europe and other international markets while we pursue marketing authorization in those markets 
pending our positive review of data from a phase iii study  we also expect to submit for marketing approval in the eu in early in addition  we sell innohep in the us and refludan in europe and other international markets 
in december  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech for satraplatin  the only oral platinum based compound in advanced clinical trials 
under the terms of the agreement  we obtained exclusive commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand 
enrollment in a phase iii study examining satraplatin as a treatment for hormone refractory prostate cancer was completed in the fourth quarter of data from this study is expected in the second half of and if positive  we expect to submit for marketing approval in the eu in early 
table of contents subsequent to december   we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with methylgene for the research  development and commercialization of methylgene s histone deacetylase hdac inhibitors in north america  europe  the middle east and certain other international markets  including mgcd  methylgene s lead hdac inhibitor  which is currently in several phase i and phase ii clinical trials 
with our combination of regulatory  development and commercial capabilities  we intend to continue to build a balanced portfolio of approved and pipeline products targeting the hematology and oncology markets 
we had total sales of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we sell our products to wholesale distributors and  for certain products  directly to hospitals and clinics 
revenue from product sales is recognized when ownership of the product is transferred to our customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
within the us and certain foreign countries revenue is recognized upon shipment freight on board shipping point since title to the product passes and our customers have assumed the risks and rewards of ownership 
in certain other foreign countries  it is common practice that ownership transfers upon receipt of product and  accordingly  in these circumstances revenue is recognized upon delivery freight on board destination when title to the product effectively transfers 
we record allowances for product returns  chargebacks  rebates and prompt pay discounts at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such amounts 
in determining allowances for product returns  chargebacks and rebates  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
for example  in determining these amounts  we estimate end customer demand  buying patterns by end customers and group purchasing organizations from wholesalers and the levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past buying patterns will predict future product sales 
the nature of our allowances requiring accounting estimates  and the specific considerations we use in estimating their amounts  are as follows product returns 
our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the month period beginning months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending months past the labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the allowance for product returns  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might remain in their inventory or in end customers inventories to within months of expiration and analyze the likelihood that such product will be returned within months after expiration 
to estimate the likelihood of product remaining in our wholesalers inventory  we rely on information from our wholesalers regarding their inventory levels  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  and on internal sales data 
we believe the information from our wholesalers and third party sources is a reliable indicator of trends  but we are unable to verify the accuracy of such data independently 
we also consider our wholesalers past buying patterns  estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped and the expiration dates of product currently being shipped 
since we do not have the ability to track a specific returned product back to its period of sale  our product returns allowance is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period during which customers have a right of return  which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf live of our products when sold to customers 
future product returns are estimated primarily based on historical sales and return rates 
for the years ended december  and  million and million of product was returned to us  representing approximately and of net sales revenue  respectively 
the allowance for returns was million at both december  and due to the small amount of returned product during and  fluctuations between our estimates and actual product returned were minimal 

table of contents however  a change in the provision for product returns for the years ended december  and would have had an approximate million effect on our reported net sales for both years 
chargebacks and rebates 
although we sell our products in the us primarily to wholesale distributors  we typically enter into agreements with certain governmental health insurance providers  hospitals  clinics  and physicians  either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their members  to allow purchase of our products at a discounted price and or to receive a volume based rebate 
we provide a credit to the wholesaler  or a chargeback  representing the difference between the wholesaler s acquisition list price and the discounted price 
rebates are paid directly to the end customer  group purchasing organization or government insurer 
as a result of these contracts  at the time of product shipment we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might be ultimately sold to a contracting entity or group purchasing organization 
for certain end customers  we must also estimate the contracting entity s or group purchasing organization s volume of purchases 
we estimate our chargeback allowance based on our estimate of the inventory levels of our products in the wholesaler distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks  and specific contractual and historical chargeback rates 
we estimate our medicaid rebate and commercial contractual rebate accruals based on estimates of usage by rebate eligible customers  estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain potentially subject to those rebates  and terms of our contractual and regulatory obligations 
at december  and  our allowance for chargebacks and rebates was million and million  respectively 
during and  our estimates  compared with actual chargebacks and rebates processed  fluctuated by as much as 
a change in the provision for chargebacks and rebates for the years ended december  and would have had an approximate million and million effect on our reported net sales for those years  respectively 
prompt pay discounts 
as incentive to expedite cash flow  we offer some customers a prompt pay discount whereby if they pay their accounts within days of product shipment  they may take a discount 
as a result  we must estimate the likelihood that our customers will take the discount at the time of product shipment 
in estimating our allowance for prompt pay discounts  we rely on past history of our customers payment patterns to determine the likelihood that future prompt pay discounts will be taken and for those customers that historically take advantage of the prompt pay discount  we increase our allowance accordingly at december  and  our allowance for prompt pay discounts was million and million  respectively 
fluctuations between our estimates and actual discounts taken were minimal in and  approximating  as most of our customers take advantage of the prompt pay discount 
a change in our provision for prompt pay discounts for the years ended december  and would have had an approximate million and million effect on our reported net sales for those years  respectively 
we have adjusted our allowances for product returns  chargebacks and rebates and prompt pay discounts in the past based on our actual experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
we continually monitor our allowances and make adjustments when we believe our actual experience may differ from our estimates 

table of contents the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our allowances for the years ended december  and amounts in thousands product chargebacks prompt pay returns and rebates discounts balance at december  current year provision actual credits or payments issued balance at december  current year provision actual credits or payments issued balance at december  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we periodically review inventories and items considered outdated or obsolete are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory levels on hand  future purchase commitments  product expiration dates and current and forecasted product demand 
if an estimate of future product demand suggests that inventory levels are excessive  then inventories are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision to reduce the estimated net realizable value of obsolete and short dated inventory by million  million  and million  respectively 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of product rights and property and equipment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our ability to recover the carrying value of long lived assets used in our business  considering changes in the business environment or other facts and circumstances that suggest their value may be impaired 
if this evaluation indicates the carrying value will not be recoverable  based on the undiscounted expected future cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets  we reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the process of calculating the expected future cash flows involves estimating future events and trends such as sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes 
the actual results of any of these factors could be materially different than what we estimate 
the net book value of our product rights and property and equipment was million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill in association with a business acquisition in and related milestone payments that were made in and  goodwill was created 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment review of goodwill at least annually 
if it is determined that the value of goodwill is impaired  we will record the impairment charge in the statement of operations in the period it is discovered 
the process of reviewing for impairment of goodwill is similar to that of long lived assets in that expected future cash flows are calculated using estimated future events and trends such as sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes 
the actual results of any of these factors could be materially different than what we estimate 
the net book value of our goodwill was million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents acquired in process research in december  we entered into a co development and licensing agreement with gpc biotech whereby we acquired commercialization rights to a drug development candidate called satraplatin in europe  the middle east  turkey  australia and new zealand 
satraplatin is in phase iii development for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer 
under terms of the license agreement  we made an up front payment to gpc biotech of million  which included million for reimbursement for past satraplatin development costs incurred by gpc biotech 
this portion of the up front payment was immediately expensed as acquired in process research as satraplatin has not yet achieved regulatory approval for marketing and  absent obtaining such approval  has no alternative future use 
recently issued accounting standards accounting for stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on the grant date fair value of the award 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value provisions of apb no 
and  as such  generally recognized no compensation costs for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method is expected to impact our results of operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earning per share in note  summary of significant accounting policies accounting for stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements  except for the acceleration of million of expense reflected in the year ended december  sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow 
we are required to adopt the standard as of january  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all rewards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
at this time  we expect to use the modified prospective method 
we are also considering the implementation guidance for sfas no 
r issued by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
in the adoption of sfas no

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december   and net sales 
net sales for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands net sales us net sales europe and other countries total net sales increase from prior year change from prior year the increase in net sales for the year ended december  as compared to is the result of having a whole year of vidaza sales in versus one half of a year in due to the commercial launch of vidaza in the us on july  net sales of vidaza were million in as compared with million in additionally  europe and other international markets experienced continued growth in compassionate use and named patient sales of thalidomide resulting in net sales of million versus million in the factors impacting thalidomide sales vary from country to country  however  the largest impact on the increased sales was the result of expansion into new markets and increase in demand 
these growth drivers have been partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling during as well as by a decline in sales in one country due to the implementation of new regulations that limit the reimbursement of drugs sold without marketing authorization  such as thalidomide 
furthermore  while both vidaza and thalidomide sales have increased in versus  sales levels have flattened on a sequential quarterly basis during the increase in sales for the year ended december  as compared to was due primarily to the launch of vidaza in the us on july  as well as growth in compassionate use and named patient sales of thalidomide in europe and other international markets 
vidaza sales for totaled million 
thalidomide sales totaled million in  compared to million in we began selling thalidomide on a compassionate use or named patient basis in france and belgium in april in july  we began selling thalidomide in additional countries in europe and other international markets 
the growth in thalidomide sales experienced in was due both to increased volume of product sold as well as an increase in the average selling price of thalidomide in certain markets 
reductions from gross to net sales  which include product returns  chargebacks  rebates and prompt pay discounts totaled million  million and million for the years ended  december   and  respectively 
the million increase in over and the million increase in over is attributed primarily to the launch of vidaza in and the increased gross revenue that was derived from it 
although the dollar amount of reductions to gross revenues increased in and  the reduction as a percentage of gross sales decreased from in to in and in this decrease is due to the launch of vidaza as well as increased sales of thalidomide  as these products have fewer chargeback and rebate agreements than our other products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of product sold  royalties due on the sales of our products and the distribution and logistics costs related to selling our products 
however  product rights amortization is excluded from cost of sales and included with operating expenses 
cost of sales for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands cost of sales increase from prior year change from prior year as a of net sales 
table of contents cost of sales increased in as compared with due to the increase in net sales for however  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in due to two factors 
first  we had a full year of vidaza sales in compared to half of a year in vidaza is one of our higher gross margin products with cost of sales as a percent of net sales of approximately 
second  the renegotiation of our thalidomide license and product supply agreements in december reduced the overall royalty and product supply costs for thalidomide 
this reduced the cost of net sales as a percent of net sales from in to in the increase in cost of sales in as compared to was attributable to the increase in net sales for the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales experienced in as compared to was largely due to charges totaling million recorded in relating to obsolete refludan product inventory 
these charges increased cost of sales as a percentage of net sales by approximately percentage points 
the launch of vidaza in also improved the overall gross margin as compared to  reducing cost of sales as a percentage of net sales by approximately percentage points as the vidaza gross margin was higher than that of our other products on a combined basis 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses generally consist of regulatory  clinical and manufacturing development  and medical and safety monitoring costs for both products in development as well as products being sold 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands clinical  development and regulatory expenses increase from prior year change from prior year the increase in clinical  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  over is due primarily to million of increased spending on clinical study costs related to ongoing survival and alternative dosing studies for vidaza  million on further development studies for thalidomide and million for other products 
additionally  employee related costs  including compensation  travel  recruiting and relocation expenses  increased by million due to increased staffing levels to support regulatory  clinical development and medical and safety monitoring activities for vidaza and thalidomide 
the remaining increase of million is due to costs related to the development of an oral formulation of vidaza and the establishment of an alternate production facility in europe 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  increased by million over this increase was due primarily to a million increase in medical safety and monitoring costs associated with the selling of our products  including expanded staffing to support the growth in sales of thalidomide as well as the us launch of vidaza 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased by million in as compared to this increase was primarily related to a million increase in personnel related costs as we expanded staffing to support the regulatory and clinical development activities of thalidomide and vidaza  including the pursuit of european marketing authorization approvals for those products 
in addition we incurred a net cost of million in for the settlement of a patent infringement suit filed by us against lipomed  ag 
these increases in clinical and regulatory expenses were partially offset by million decline in clinical development expenses for vidaza and thalidomide in  due primarily to the completion of clinical data analysis in to support the submission of the vidaza new drug approval application filed with the fda in the fourth quarter of finally  manufacturing development expenses declined by million in due to the completion in of vidaza manufacturing development activities required for the submission of the new drug application for vidaza 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the cost to complete projects in development is not reasonably estimable 
results from clinical trials may not be favorable 
further  data from clinical trials is subject to varying interpretation  and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  clinical 
table of contents development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
the licensing of commercial rights to satraplatin and to methylgene s hdac inhibitors in december and january  respectively  will have a significant impact on our clinical  development and regulatory expenses for pursuant to these license agreements  we are required to fund a significant percentage of the development expenses for these products 
combined with increased development activities for vidaza and thalidomide  we expect our clinical  development and regulatory expenses for will increase by approximately over the amount 
acquired in process research 
in december  we entered into a co development and licensing agreement with gpc biotech ag whereby we acquired commercialization rights to a drug development candidate called satraplatin in europe  the middle east  turkey  australia and new zealand 
satraplatin is in phase iii development for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer 
under terms of the license agreement  we made an up front payment to gpc biotech of million in early january  which included million for reimbursement for past satraplatin development costs incurred by gpc biotech 
this portion of the up front payment was immediately expensed as acquired in process research as satraplatin has not yet achieved regulatory approval for marketing and  absent obtaining such approval  has no alternative future use 
no such expenses were incurred in or we will  however  record a similar charge of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with the up front payments made to methylgene in connection with the acquisition of rights to their hdac inhibitors 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling expenses include salaries and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  advertising and promotional programs  professional education programs and facility costs for our sales offices located throughout europe  and in thailand and australia 
general and administrative expenses include personnel related costs for corporate staff  outside legal  tax and auditing services  corporate facilities and insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses increase from prior year change from prior year selling  general and administrative expenses have continued to increase significantly over the three year period ended december  due to the establishment and expansion of our commercial organizations in the us  europe  and australia to support the selling of our products in those markets 
our general and administrative functions also expanded over this period to support the growth of our business and the additional requirements of becoming a publicly held company 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million for  an increase of million over this increase is primarily the result of continued expansion related to our commercial operations and the associated sales and marketing activities due to having one full year of vidaza sales in the us for  as it was launched on july   and for continued growth of thalidomide sales in our international markets 
field sales and sales management expenses in the us increased by million in due to having an expanded sales force for the entire year of european and international field sales and sales management expenses increased by million in due to increased selling activities to support the increased sales growth of thalidomide 
most of the international markets were similar to the us in that expansion of staff and related expenses occurred during  creating a partial years worth of expenses compared to a full year of those ongoing expenses in marketing expenses increased by million in  due almost entirely to the us having a full year of marketing activities for vidaza sales versus half a year in sales and marketing expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over generally  this increase was due to expansion of our commercial organization and sales and marketing activities in the us and our european and other international markets to support the us launch of vidaza and the significant growth in thalidomide sales 
field sales and sales management 
table of contents expenses in the us increased by million in due to the expansion of our sales organization to support the launch of vidaza 
we increased our us field based organization from approximately employees to employees during other us selling expenses also increased in connection with the vidaza launch 
european and international field sales and sales management expenses increased by million in we began selling thalidomide in europe on a compassionate use or named patient basis in mid the sales expense growth in reflects having these costs for a full year in as well as increased selling activities to support the sales growth of thalidomide 
marketing expenses increased by million in  due primarily to the us launch of vidaza and increased activities to support the sales growth of thalidomide 
product marketing costs increased by million while non product specific costs  such as personnel costs and travel  increased by million 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the continued expansion of our corporate infrastructure to support the commercial growth of our company caused million of the increase in expenses 
of the million increase  million was for human resources costs related to various professional fees and recruitment and relocation fees  million was for increased legal staffing and costs associated with numerous business development projects  million increase in stock registration and related fees  million increase in directors and officers liability insurance premiums and a million increase in facility costs due to a newly relocated and expanded international office 
additionally  the remaining million of the million increase relates to costs associated with the relocation of the new international office 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with becoming a public company with the completion of our initial public offering in november professional fees  including legal  accounting  tax and sarbanes oxley implementation consulting  increased by million during directors and officers liability insurance premiums increased by million in and the establishment of our investor relations function increased expenses by million 
in addition  business development costs increased by million in as we significantly increased our activities associated with identifying potential product licensing and acquisition candidates 
product rights amortization 
product rights amortization expense for the years ended december   and was as follows 
in thousands product rights amortization increase from prior year change from prior year the increase of million in amortization expense in as compared to is primarily due to the restructuring of our thalidomide license and supply agreements in the fourth quarter of  which increased the thalidomide product rights asset balance by million 
the increase in amortization expense in as compared to was due primarily to having a full year of amortization of product rights acquired through the purchase of laphal developpement in april in addition  the august renegotiation of the financial terms of the refludan product rights resulted in an increase to the value of the capitalized product rights and increased the related amortization expense for all of compared to only months of 
table of contents interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  for the years ended december   and was as follows 
in thousands interest and other income expense  net increase decrease from prior year change from prior year the million increase in interest and other income  expense  in as compared to is due to the growth of interest income as a result of higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as well as improved investment returns resulting from higher interest rates 
the higher cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balances were maintained for all of as compared with where the increased balance did not occur until a secondary equity offering was completed in july interest and other income expense  net  increased million in as compared with due primarily to increased interest income from higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from the equity offerings completed in november and july in addition  in march million of convertible notes  originally issued in april  were converted into shares of our common stock  thereby eliminating the interest expense associated with those notes 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the years ended december   and was as follows 
in thousands income tax expense increase from prior year change from prior year the provision for income taxes reflects management s estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable in each of our taxing jurisdictions 
income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million in is attributable to an increase in taxable income in certain foreign countries as well as incurring alternative minimum tax in the us as a result of being profitable for the first time 
alternative minimum tax was triggered as a result of utilizing approximately million of net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income 
income tax expense increased million in as compared with although we have pre tax losses on a consolidated basis  certain of our foreign subsidiaries generate taxable income  and therefore incur income tax expense 
the increase in income tax expense for as compared to was due primarily to an increase in taxable income in certain foreign countries 
liquidity and capital resources we achieved profitability on a full year basis for the first time in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we achieved profitability during  our recent business development transactions will significantly increase our clinical  development and regulatory expenses 
as a result  we expect we will once again incur net losses for to date  our operations have been funded primarily with proceeds from the sale of preferred and common stock and net sales of our products 
net proceeds from our preferred stock sales totaled million and our public offerings of common stock completed in november and july resulted in combined net proceeds of million 
we began generating revenue from product sales in july cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased from million at december  to million at december  this million decrease is primarily due to purchases of product 
table of contents rights and business acquisition payments totaling million  purchases of property and equipment of million  debt repayment of million and a million decrease in translated foreign currencies due to the strengthening of the us dollar  partially offset by million in net cash provided by operations and million received as proceeds for exercise of common stock options 
subsequent to december   we made cash payments totaling million to partners in connection with the licensing of satraplatin and the methylgene hdac inhibitors 
we expect that our cash on hand at december   along with cash generated from expected product sales  will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we reexamine our cash requirements periodically in light of changes in our business 
for example  in the event that we make additional product acquisitions  we may need to raise additional funds 
adequate funds  either from the financial markets or other sources may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds may cause us to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned development  commercialization or expansion activities 
our future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities  the cost of clinical studies and other actions needed to obtain regulatory approval of our products in development  and the timing and cost of any product acquisitions 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands clinical development funding operating leases inventory purchase commitments product royalty payments product acquisition payments long term debt obligations total fixed contractual obligations clinical development funding 
in december  we entered into a co development and licensing agreement for satraplatin with gpc biotech 
pursuant to that agreement  we made an up front payment of million to gpc biotech in early january of that amount  million was allocated to acquired in process research and charged to expenses in the remaining amount of million represents a prepayment of future clinical development costs 
the licensing agreement also stipulates we provide an additional million for similar future development costs 
this amount is reflected in the schedule above in equal annual amounts for we previously entered into two agreements with celgene to provide funding to support clinical development studies sponsored by celgene studying thalidomide as a treatment for various types of cancers 
under these agreements  we paid celgene million in and will pay million in each of and operating leases 
our commitment for operating leases relates primarily to our corporate and sales offices located in the us  europe  thailand and australia 
these lease commitments expire on various dates through inventory purchase commitments 
the contractual summary above includes contractual obligations related to our product supply contracts 
under these contracts  we provide our suppliers with rolling month supply forecasts  with the initial month periods representing binding purchase commitments 
product royalty payments 
pursuant to our thalidomide product license agreements with celgene  we are required to make additional quarterly payments to the extent that the royalty and license payments due 
table of contents under those agreements do not meet certain minimums 
these minimum royalty and license payment obligations expire the earlier of or the date we obtain regulatory approval to market thalidomide in the eu the amounts reflected in the summary above represent the minimum amounts due under these agreements 
in addition  our innohep license agreement with leo pharma requires annual minimum royalty payments through product acquisition payments 
we have future payment obligations associated with the june addition to thalidomide product rights 
we paid million in june  with additional million payments due in each of and contingent product acquisition payments 
the contractual summary above reflects only payment obligations for product and company acquisitions that are fixed and determinable 
we also have contractual payment obligations  the amount and timing of which are contingent upon future events 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  contingent payment obligations are not recorded on our balance sheet until the amount due can be reasonably determined 
under the terms of the agreement with gpc biotech  we will pay them up to an additional million based on the achievement of certain regulatory filing and approval milestones  up to an additional million for up to five subsequent eu approvals for additional indications and we will pay them sales milestones totaling up to million  based on the achievement of significant annual sales levels in our territories 
similarly  under the agreement with methylgene  our milestone payments for mgcd could reach million  based on the achievement of significant development  regulatory and sales goals  with the nearest milestone of million to be paid upon enrollment of the first patient in a phase ii trial 
furthermore  up to million for each additional hdac inhibitor may be paid  also based on the achievement of significant development  regulatory and sales milestones 
also  under the agreements with schering ag  payments totaling up to million are due if milestones relating to revenue and gross margin targets for refludan are achieved

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently invest our excess cash balances in short term investment grade securities including money market accounts that are subject to interest rate risk 
the amount of interest income we earn on these funds will decline with a decline in interest rates 
however  due to the short term nature of short term investment grade securities and money market accounts  an immediate decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar for inter company trading transactions and the translation of net assets and earnings of non us subsidiaries 
our primary operating currencies are the us dollar  british pound sterling  the euro  and swiss francs 
we have not undertaken any foreign currency hedges through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts or options 
foreign currency exposures have been managed solely through managing the currency denomination of our cash balances
