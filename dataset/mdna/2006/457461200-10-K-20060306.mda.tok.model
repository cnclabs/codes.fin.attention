the payments will be made to us for a period ranging from one to two years from the date of acquisition of the property or until the vacant space is leased and tenants begin paying rent 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap require us to treat these payments as a reduction to the purchase price of the investment properties upon receipt of the payment  rather than as rental income 
as of december   we had three investment properties  woodfield commons  located in schaumburg  illinois  orland park place i ii  located in orland park  illinois and greentree center  located in caledonia  wisconsin subject to master lease agreements

distributions for federal income tax purposes  distributions may consist of ordinary income distributions  non taxable return of capital  capital gains or a combination thereof 
distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes are taxable to the recipient as either ordinary or capital gain distributions 
distributions in excess of these earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes will constitute a non taxable return of capital rather than a distribution and will reduce the recipient s basis in the shares to the extent thereof  and thereafter as taxable gain 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits have the effect of deferring taxation of the amount of the distribution until the sale of the stockholder s shares 
in order to maintain our status as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income  to our stockholders 
reit taxable income is defined as taxable income excluding the deduction for distributions paid and net capital gains

this section provides the following an executive summary and our strategies and objectives  the critical accounting policies that impact the treatment  for financial statement purposes  of certain items such as how we value our investment properties  recognize rental income and depreciate our assets  a discussion of our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows and how the changes in balance sheet and cash flow items from year to year impact our liquidity and capital resources  a discussion of our results of operations  including changes in funds from operations ffo from year to year and a discussion of the impact that inflation may have on our results  and a discussion of the important factors that may impact your investment 
we have elected to be taxed for federal income tax purposes as a reit 
this election has important consequences  as it requires us to satisfy certain tests regarding the nature of the revenues we can generate and the distributions that we pay to our stockholders 
to ensure that we continue to qualify to be taxed as a reit  we determine  on a quarterly basis  that the gross income  asset and distribution tests imposed by the code are satisfied 
on an ongoing basis  as due diligence is performed on potential real estate purchases or temporary investment of uninvested capital  we determine that the income from the new assets qualifies for reit purposes 
to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must distribute of our reit taxable income to our stockholders 
we qualified to be taxed as a reit commencing with the tax year ending december  as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we satisfy the various requirements set forth in the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  our income will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates 
even though we qualify for taxation as a reit  our income may be subject to certain state and local taxes and property and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
executive summary we are an owner operator of neighborhood retail centers gross leasable areas ranging from  to  square feet and community centers gross leasable areas in excess of  square feet 
we are a self administered reit formed under maryland law 
our investment properties are located primarily within approximately miles of our headquarters in oak brook  illinois 
additionally  we own and acquire single user retail properties located throughout the united states 
we also may construct or develop properties or render services in connection with such development or construction 
as of december   we owned interests in investment properties 
essentially all of our revenues and cash flows are generated by collecting rental payments from our tenants 
our goal is to continue increasing our revenues by acquiring additional investment properties and re leasing those spaces that are vacant  or may become vacant  at more favorable rental rates 
we believe we have significant acquisition opportunities due to our reputation and our concentration of properties in the chicago and minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan areas 
our largest expenses relate to the operation of our properties as well as the interest expense on our mortgages payable 
our property operating expenses include  but are not limited to  real estate taxes  regular maintenance  landscaping  snow removal and periodic renovations to meet tenant needs 
we will use cash received from our dividend reinvestment plan  proceeds from financings on previously unencumbered properties  draws on our line of credit and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders to continue purchasing additional investment properties 
we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance because along with cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  ffo provides a measure of a reit s ability to service debt and make capital expenditures and acquisitions 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo in conjunction with our acquisition policy to determine investment capitalizati on strategy and we also use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements as a measure used in determining incentive based compensation 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
therefore  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ebitda is defined as earnings losses from continuing operations  calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to chan ges in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we look at several factors to measure our operating performance to measure our operating results to those of other retail real estate owners operators in our area  we compare occupancy percentage  and our rental rates to the average rents charged by our competitors in similar centers 
to measure our operating results to those of other reits  we compare company wide growth in income or ffo  same store growth in income  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of investment in properties 
there are risks associated with retenanting our properties  including length of time required to fill vacancies  possibly re leasing at rental rates lower than current market rates or the rate on the expiring lease  leasing costs associated with the new lease such as leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances  and paying operating expenses without tenant reimbursements 
strategies and objectives our primary business objective is to enhance the performance and value of our investment properties through management strategies that address the needs of an evolving retail marketplace 
our strong commitment to operating our centers efficiently and effectively is  we believe  a direct result of our expertise in the acquisition  development re development  either directly or through a joint venture  management and leasing of our properties 
we focus on the following areas in order to achieve our objectives acquisitions we seek to selectively acquire well located single user retail properties  neighborhood retail centers and community centers 
we acquire properties either without financing contingencies or by assuming existing debt to provide us with a competitive advantage over other potential purchasers 
we concentrate our property acquisitions in areas where we have a large market concentration 
in doing this  we believe we are able to attract new retailers to the area and possibly lease several locations to them 
additionally  we are able to get existing retailers to lease more space at our current investment properties 
joint ventures we actively pursue new development opportunities through joint ventures with established local developers 
we have formed joint ventures to acquire stabilized retail properties as well as properties to be re developed and vacant land to be developed 
we will earn fees from the joint ventures for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
operations we actively manage costs to minimize operating expenses by centralizing all management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting and data processing activities 
improve rental income and cash flow by aggressively marketing rentable space 
emphasize regular maintenance and periodic renovation to meet the needs of tenants and to maximize long term returns 
maintain a diversified tenant base consisting primarily of retail tenants providing consumer goods and services 
proactively review our existing portfolio for potential re development opportunities 
during the year ended december   we acquired six additional investment properties totaling approximately  square feet for  additionally  we sold three investment properties  a  square foot section of one shopping center and an  square foot ace hardware  approximately one acre of land at another of our investment properties and contributed six investment properties into a joint venture 
total proceeds from these sales and contributions were  net of closing costs 
critical accounting policies general a critical accounting policy is one that would materially affect our operating results or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to how we value our investment properties and determine whether assets are held for sale  recognize rental income and lease termination income  our cost capitalization and depreciation policies and consolidation equity accounting policies 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties known which were taken into consideration upon the application of critical accounting policies an d the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
valuation and allocation of investment properties 
on a quarterly basis  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we review impairment indicators and if necessary  we conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each investment property does not exceed its estimated fair value 
we evaluate our investment properties to assess whether any impairment indicators are present  including recurring operating losses and significant adverse changes in legal factors or business climate 
if an investment property is considered impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
no such losses have been required or recorded in the accompanying financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and in determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired  management considers several factors  such as projected rental and vacancy rates  property operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest rates 
the capitalization rate used to determine property valuation is based on the market in which the property is located  length of leases  tenant financial strength  the economy in general  demographics  environment  property location  visibility  age  physical condition and investor return requirements among others 
market capitalization rates fluctuate based on factors such as interest rates 
an increase in capitalization rates might result in a market valuation lower than our original purchase price 
additionally  we obtain an appraisal prepared by a third party at the time we purchase the investment property 
all of the aforementioned factors are considered by management in determining the v alue of any particular property 
the value of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain factors  either individually or taken as a whole 
should the actual results differ from management s judgment  the valuation could be negatively or positively affected 
we allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property between land  building and improvements  other intangibles including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases  customer relationships and acquired in place leases and any financing assumed that is determined to be above or below market terms 
the allocation of the purchase price is an area that requires complex judgments and significant estimates 
the value allocated to land as opposed to building affects the amount of depreciation expense we record 
if more value is attributed to land  depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to building and improvements 
we use the information contained in the third party appraisals as the primary basis for allocating the purchase price between land  building and improvements 
we determine whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar inv estment properties 
the aggregate value of other intangibles is measured based on the difference between the purchase price and the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize information contained in independent appraisals and management s estimates to determine the respective as if vacant property values 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases and the risk adjusted cost of capital 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  up to months 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
we allocate the difference between the purchase price of the property and the as if vacant value first to acquired above and below market leases 
we evaluate each acquired lease based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and consider various factors including geographic location  size and location of leased space within the investment property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to the acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
the determination of the discount rate used in the present value calculation is based upon a rate for each individual lease and primarily based upon the credit worthiness of each individual tenant 
the value of the acquired above and below market leases is amortized over the life of the related leases as an adjustment to rental income 
we then allocate the remaining difference to the value of acquired in place leases and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of specific leases and our overall relationship with the respective tenants 
the evaluation of acquired in place leases consists of a variety of components including the costs avoided associated with originating the acquired in place lease  including but not limited to  leasing commissions  tenant improvement costs and legal costs 
we also consider the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs and rental income estimated to be incurred during the assumed re leasing period 
the value of the acquired in place lease is amortized over the average lease term as a component of amortization expense 
we also consider whether any customer relationship value exists related to the property acquisition 
as of december   we had not allocated any amounts to customer relationships 
the valuation and possible subsequent impairment in the value of our investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s continuous process of analyzing each property 
cost capitalization and depreciation policies 
we review all expenditures and capitalize any item that is deemed to be an upgrade or a tenant improvement 
if we capitalize more expenditures  current depreciation expense would be higher  however  total current expenses would be lower 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method 
buildings and improvements are depreciated based upon estimated useful lives of years for buildings and improvements  years for site improvements and the remaining life of the related lease for tenant improvements 
assets held for sale 
in determining whether to classify an asset as held for sale  we consider whether i management has committed to a plan to sell the asset  ii the asset is available for immediate sale  in its present condition  iii we have initiated a program to locate a buyer  iv we believe that the sale of the asset is probable  v we are actively marketing the asset for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value  and vi actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan 
if all of the above criteria are met  we classify the asset as held for sale 
on the day that these criteria are met  we suspend depreciation on the assets held for sale  including depreciation for tenant improvements and additions  as well as on the amortization of acquired in place leases and customer relationship values 
the assets and liabilities associated with those assets that are held for sale are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period 
additionally  the operations for the periods presented are classified on the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
from time to time  we may determine that a held for sale property no longer meets the criteria to continue to be classified as held for sale 
if this occurs  we record the property at the lower of the carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale adjusted for depreciation expense or the fair value at the decision date not to sell 
as of december   we had classified the following properties as held for sale dominick s  glendale heights  illinois  crestwood plaza  crestwood  illinois  calumet square  calumet city  illinois  dominick s  highland park  illinois this property was subsequently contributed to a joint venture  wauconda shopping center  wauconda  illinois  and walgreens  decatur  illinois 
during the year ended december   several of these properties no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale 
in connection with the reclassification of the properties from held for sale to continuing operations  we recorded adjustments for depreciation expense of  for the year ended december  at december   we had no properties classified as held for sale 
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries 
under gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining rent  generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
due to the impact of straight lining  rental income exceeded the cash collected for such rent by   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated sta tements of operations 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectibility of outstanding receivables 
allowances are taken for those balances that we deem to be uncollectible  including any amounts relating to straight line rent receivables 
tenant recoveries are primarily comprised of real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursement income 
real estate tax income is based on an accrual reimbursement calculation by tenant  based on an estimate of current year real estate taxes 
as actual real estate tax bills are received  we reconcile with our tenants and adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
common area maintenance income is accrued on actual common area maintenance expenses as incurred 
annually  we reconcile with the tenants for their share of the expenses per their lease and we adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
recognition of lease termination income 
we accrue lease termination income if there is a signed termination agreement  all of the conditions of the agreement have been met and the tenant is no longer occupying the property 
consolidation equity accounting policies 
we consolidate the operations of a joint venture if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or have substantial influence and control of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual returns  or both 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or the determination of who has control and influence of the entity 
when we consolidate an entity  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a variable interest entity are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in instances where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or we do not control the joint venture  we use the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the operations of a joint venture are not consolidated with our operations but instead our share of operations is reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  our net investment in the joint venture is reflected as investment in and advances to joint venture as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
liquidity and capital resources this section describes our balance sheet and discusses our liquidity and capital commitments 
our most liquid asset is cash and cash equivalents which consists of cash and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
see our discussion of the statements of cash flows for a description of our cash activity during and we consider all demand deposits  money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less  at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions 
the combined account balances at one or more institutions periodically exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage and  as a result  there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposits in excess of fdic insurance coverage 
n bsp  we believe that the risk is not significant  as we do not anticipate the financial institutions non performance 
income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
the table below presents lease payments to be received in the future from properties that we owned as of december  other sources of cash include amounts raised from the sale of securities under our dividend reinvestment plan drp  our draws on the line of credit with keybank na  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders 
if necessary  such as for new acquisitions  we can generate cash flow by entering into financing arrangements or possible joint venture agreements with institutional investors 
we use our cash primarily to pay distributions to our stockholders  for operating expenses at our investment properties  for purchasing additional investment properties and to repay draws on the line of credit 
minimum lease payments under leases in place at december  to be received in the future  excluding rental income under master lease agreements and assuming no expiring leases are renewed are as follows thereafter total as of december   we owned interests in investment properties 
of the investment properties owned  twenty are currently unencumbered by any indebtedness 
we generally limit our secured indebtedness to approximately of the original purchase price  or current market value if higher  of the investment properties in the aggregate 
these twenty unencumbered investment properties were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  and would therefore yield at least  in additional cash from financing  using this standard 
additionally  we generate cash by drawing down on our unsecured line of credit with keybank 
we have limited availability under this line  which may reduce our ability to borrow additional funds to purchase additional investment properties 
in the aggregate  all of our investment properties are currently generating sufficient cash flow to pay our operating expenses  debt service requirements and distributions equ al to per share on an annual basis 
the following table presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  as of december   including monthly amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter a thereafter total a included in the debt maturing during is our line of credit with keybank na this line of credit requires compliance with certain covenants  such as debt service ratios  minimum net worth requirements  distribution limitations and investment restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities statements of cash flows compared to cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to distributions received from the operations of our joint ventures 
this increase is offset by a decrease in cash received from the contribution of the properties to our joint ventures 
we received cash from operations for these properties for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased by  as we acquired six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  and generating  of disposition proceeds  as compared to the acquisition of six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  and generating  of disposition proceeds 
additionally  we received  in distributions from our joint ventures and used more cash to purchase investment securities during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   as we used more cash to payoff debt and pay loan fees on new debt  which was offset by less cash used to pay down our line of credit 
additionally  during the year ended december   we received less proceeds from shares issued under our drp

at december   we had ownership interests in single user retail properties  neighborhood retail centers and community centers 
we generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations 
in order to evaluate our overall portfolio  management analyzes the operating performance of properties that we have owned and operated for the same twelve month periods during each year 
a total of of our investment properties satisfied these criteria during the periods presented and are referred to herein as same store properties 
these properties comprise approximately million square feet 
a total of eight investment properties  those that have been acquired during the years ended december   and are presented as other investment properti es in the table below 
the same store investment properties represent approximately of the square footage of our portfolio at december  this analysis allows management to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio 
additionally  we are able to determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income 
net income available to common stockholders and net income available to common stockholder per weighted average common share for the years ended december   and are summarized below net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders per weighted average common shares basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted the following table presents the operating results  broken out between same store and other investment properties  prior to straight line rental income  interest  depreciation  amortization and bad debt expense for the years ended december   and along with reconciliation to income from continuing operations  calculated in accordance with gaap

during the year ended december   we paid approximately for our annual listing fee and the registration of additional shares pursuant to our equity award plan 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this is due to an increase in salaries and other payroll related items as well as additional accounting fees for our continued compliance with sarbanes oxley 
this increase was offset by decreases related to investor service costs incurred in in relation to our certificate exchange program and lower fees paid for data processing services in there were additional services necessary in for our sarbanes oxley compliance that were not necessary in general and administrative expenses increased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributable to increased accounting fees paid in relation to our compliance with sarbanes oxley  increased salaries due to an increase is staff to accommodate our growth and investor service costs in relation to our certificate exchange program 
other income increased for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december  and the increase in other income is attributable to acquisition fees earned on our unconsolidated joint ventures 
this increase is offset by a decrease in gains recorded in on the sale of our investment in securities 
other income increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the sale of investment securities which resulted in gains on sale of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately during the year ended december  interest expense decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this is primarily due to the contribution of properties into the joint ventures that occurred in and our portion of the interest expense for these properties is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to additional interest paid on amounts drawn on the line of credit with keybank na and the fees paid on the unused portion of this line 
additionally  interest expense increased due to an increase in mortgages payable from new acquisitions and the refinancing of existing debt with new loans having a larger principal balance 
joint ventures on february   a wholly owned subsidiary of ours entered into an llc agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of tri land properties  inc for the acquisition and redevelopment of the century consumer mall in merrillville  indiana 
each partner s initial equity contribution was in addition  we had committed to lend the llc up to  draws on the loan bear interest at a rate of per annum  with interest only paid monthly on average outstanding balances 
the loan is secured by the property and had an initial maturity date of january  through december   we had accounted for our investment in this joint venture under the equity method of accounting because we were not the managing member and did not have the ability to control the joint venture 
we adopted fin r on january  in accordance with fin r  we evaluated this joint venture and determined that we were the primary beneficiary in this variable interest entity 
as a result  the accounts of the joint venture were consolidated with our financial statements for financial reporting purposes 
on june   we entered into a buy out and restructuring agreement

we agreed to lend tri land properties  inc up to  draws on the loan bear interest at a rate of per annum  with to be paid currently and the remaining to be accrued and paid upon maturity 
tri land properties inc has guaranteed  of this mortgage receivable 
as a result of the agreement  we re evaluated the criteria for prima ry beneficiaries under fin r and determined that we are no longer the primary beneficiary in this variable interest entity and therefore  deconsolidated the joint venture effective june  we have recorded a deferred gain of  on the sale of our equity investment  as we did not qualify for gain recognition due to our lack of initial investment and continuing involvement 
such amounts are included in other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
effective june   we formed a strategic joint venture with tucker development corporation tdc 
we contributed park avenue centre formerly known as dominick s highland park to the joint venture as our capital contribution 
tdc will provide construction management  development supervision and leasing services 
during the period of joint ownership  operating proceeds from the property will be split equally  with the exception of debt service on the construction loan  which is paid using loan proceeds 
our maximum commitment to this joint venture is  in cash  in addition to our contribution of the investment property to the venture 
following completion of the redevelopment  we have the option to purchase tdc s interest in the joint venture or the property can be sold to a third party with the proceeds from the sale split proportionately between each partner 
the operations of the property we contributed are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement with this shopping center 
in accordance with fin r  we have evaluated this joint venture and determined that we are the primary beneficiary in this variable interest entity 
as a result  we consolidated the accounts of the joint venture with our financial statements for financial reporting purposes

off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures effective september   we formed a strategic joint venture with an affiliate of crow holdings managers  llc 
through a partial sale of the  square foot hastings marketplace  each entity acquired a ownership interest in the venture  which owns the property  which is located in hastings  minnesota 
hastings marketplace is anchored by a cub foods grocery store and was acquired for  by the venture 
we are the managing member of the venture and we earn fees for providing property management and leasing services to the venture 
we only recognize our share of the management fee income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with the partial sale of hastings marketplace to the venture  we recognized a gain of approximately the gain and operations were not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing ownership interest in this shopping center 
we determined that the venture is not a variable interest entity and account for our interest in the venture using the equity method of accounting as we have significant influence over  but not control of  the major operating and financial policies of the joint venture 
we share equally in the profits and losses of the joint venture  which are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
effective october   we formed a strategic joint venture with the new york state teachers retirement system nystrs 
the joint venture has been formed to initially acquire eight of our neighborhood retail centers and community centers  with an estimated value of approximately  located in the chicago and minneapolis areas 
in addition  the joint venture anticipates acquiring up to an additional  of neighborhood retail centers and community centers located in the targeted markets of illinois  wisconsin and minnesota 
during the year ended december   we completed our initial contribution of eight properties  with an approximate fair market value of  and an approximate net equity value of  as of december   nystrs had contributed approximately  in cash to the joint venture 
in addition  nystrs has committed to contribute  subject to satisfying certain conditions  such as lender consents  an additional  for future acquisitions  for a total contribution of approximately  we have also agreed to invest  subject to satisfying certain conditions such as lender consents  an additional  in the joint venture 
the joint venture will acquire additional assets using leverage  consistent with its existing business plan  of of the original purchase price  or current market value if higher  during the next two years to achieve its investment objectives 
during the year ended december   nystrs contributed an additional  to the joint venture to acquire three additional investment properties  for a total equity contribution of  we are the managing member of the venture and earn fees for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services to the venture 
we only recognize our share of the management fee income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the profits and losses of the joint venture are shared equally be tween nystrs and us  except for the interest earned on the initial invested funds  of which we are allocated 
the operations of the properties we contributed are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement with these shopping centers 
we determined that the venture is not a variable interest entity and account for our interest in the venture using the equity method of accounting as we have significant influence over  but not control of  the major operating and financial policies of the joint venture 
we share equally in the profits and losses of the joint venture  which are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the difference between our investment in the joint venture and the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of the joint venture is due to basis differences resulting from our equity investment recorded at its historical basis versus the fair market value of certain of our contributions to the joint venture 
such differences are amortized over the depreciable liv es of the joint venture s property assets 
for the year ended december   we recorded  of amortization of this basis difference 
non gaap financial measures we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance because along with cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  it provides a measure of a reit s ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures and acquisitions 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reaso ns 
we use ffo in conjunction with our acquisition policy to determine investment capitalization strategy and we also use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives received based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with gaap  for purposes of evaluating our opera ting performance 
the following table reflects our ffo for the periods presented  reconciled to net income available to common stockholders for these periods for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net income available to common stockholders gain on sale of investment properties gain on non operating income equity in depreciation of unconsolidated joint ventures amortization on in place lease intangibles amortization on leasing commissions depreciation  net of minority interest funds from operations net income available to common stockholders per weighted average common share  basic and diluted funds from operations  per weighted average common share  basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding  basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to c hanges in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits

inflation our long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of our leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation

risk factors set forth below are the risk factors that we believe are material to our investors 
this section contains forward looking statements 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements on page our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets  and consequently the value of your shares  are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to you will be adversely affected 
the following factors  among others  may adversely affect the income generated by our properties downturns in the national  regional and local economic climate  competition from other retail properties  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand for retail properties  changes in interest rates and availability of financing  vacancies  changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair  renovate and re lease space  increased operating costs  including  but not limited to  insurance expense  utilities  real estate taxes  state and local taxes  and heightened security costs  civil disturbances  natural disasters  or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses  significant expenditures associated with each investment  such as debt service payments  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from properties  and declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants 
we compete for tenants 
we compete for tenants with the owners of a number of properties that are similar in size to our properties 
some of these properties are newer or better located than our properties 
further  our competitors may have greater resources  which could allow them to reduce rents to a level that is not profitable for us 
we may be required to spend money upgrading or renovating investment properties to make them attractive to both existing and potential tenants thus increasing expenses and reducing cash resources 
in addition  our properties compete against other forms of retailing such as catalog companies and e commerce websites that offer similar retail products 
our investment properties are located primarily within approximately miles of our headquarters in oak brook  illinois 
hence  our results are affected by economic conditions in this region 
this region has experienced economic downturns in the past and will likely experience downturns in the future 
layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics  increases in the supply of property or reduced demand may decrease our revenues or increase operating expenses or both 
we face risks associated with property acquisitions 
we have and intend to continue to acquire properties and portfolios of properties  including large properties that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure 
our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all  acquired properties may fail to perform as expected  the actual costs of repositioning and redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates  acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy  lack of business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures  and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into our existing operations  and thus could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties  we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it  which could adversely affect our results from operations and cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 
we plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities 
we may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well capitalized real estate investors  including publicly traded and private reits  institutional funds and other real estate investors  even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property  it will contain conditions to closing  including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction  which may not be satisfied  and even if we are able to acquire a desired property  competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price 
leases on approximately of our rentable square feet expire during and of rentable square footage was physically vacant as of december  as leases expire  we may not be able to renew or re lease space at rates comparable to  or better than  the rates contained in the expiring leases 
leases on approximately  square feet  or approximately of total rentable square feet of  will expire prior to december  if we fail to renew or re lease space at rates that are at least comparable to the rates on expiring leases  revenues at the impacted properties will decline 
further  we may have to spend significant sums of money to renew or re lease space covered by expiring leases 
as of december  approximately  square feet  or approximately of total rentable square feet of  was physically vacant 
we continue to receive rent at approximately  square feet of the vacant space or approximately of total rentable square feet from tenants who are still obligated under their lease terms 
we will continue to receive this rent until the related leases expire in nine months to sixteen years 
tenants may fail to pay their rent  declare bankruptcy or seek to restructure their leases 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from leasing space at our investment properties 
thus  our results may be negatively affected by the failure of tenants to pay rent when due 
we may experience substantial delays and expense enforcing rights against tenants who do not pay their rent or who seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws 
even if a tenant did not seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  the tenant may from time to time experience a downturn in its business which may weaken its financial condition and its ability to make rental payments when due  leading these tenants to seek revisions to their leases 
we may not be able to quickly vary our portfolio 
investments in real estate are relatively illiquid 
except in certain circumstances  in order to continue qualifying as a reit  we are subject to rules and regulations that limit the ability to sell investment properties within a short period of time 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties 
in response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of september   the federal terrorism risk insurance act was enacted in november to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined by the statute through december  the federal terrorism risk insurance act was extended december  through december  in connection with the renewal of coverage for the policy year which began october   we evaluated coverage on terms and amounts comparable to the expiring policies  subject to cost and market availability 
our primary liability insurance policy limits are  per occurrence with a  aggregate 
nbs p  our umbrella liability insurance policy limits total  with a self insured retention 
this policy excludes nuclear  biological and chemical terrorism other than certified acts of terrorism 
the liability policies include certified acts of terrorism 
our property insurance policy is an all risk  replacement cost policy which also includes certified acts of terrorism 
we continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general  and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular  but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years 
there are other types of losses  such as from wars  acts of nuclear  biological or chemical terrorism or the presence of mold at our properties  for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost 
with respect to these losses and losses from acts of terrorism  earthquakes or other catastrophic events  if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties  as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties 
depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property  it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of our real estate 
if unidentified environmental problems arise  we may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders because as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination  the law typically imposes clean up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination  even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination  each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs  and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs 
these costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
in addition  applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties  or increasing the restrictions on the handling  storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos 
these laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos  and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
some of our properties are located in urban  industrial and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination 
it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys for each property we seek to acquire 
these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas  an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state  federal and historical documents  but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling 
where appropriate  on a property by property basis  our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing  including sampling for asbestos  for lead in drinking water  for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage create a potential environmental problem  and for contamination in groundwater 
even though these environmental assessments are conducted  there is still the risk that the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted  and future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us 
inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and  depending on the results  remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs 
indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources  and biological contaminants such as molds  pollen  viruses and bacteria 
indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals 
if these conditions were to occur at one of our properties  we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program  including without limitation  steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants 
these remediation programs could be costly  necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property s tenants or require rehabilitatio n of the affected property 
our objectives may conflict with those of our joint venture partners 
we own certain of our investment properties  through joint ventures with third parties 
in some cases  we control the joint venture and in some cases we are a minority partner 
investments in joint ventures involve risks that are not otherwise present with properties which we own entirely 
for example  a joint venture partner may file for bankruptcy protection or may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our goals or interests 
further  although we may own a controlling interest in a joint venture and may have authority over major decisions such as the sale or refinancing of investment properties  we may have fiduciary duties to the joint venture partners or the joint venture itself that may cause  or require  us to take or refrain from taking actions that we would otherwise take if we owned the investment prope rties outright 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings  including shopping centers  be made accessible to disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants 
if  pursuant to the americans with disabilities act  we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties  including the removal of access barriers  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  as well as the amount of cash available for distributions to you 
our properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and life safety requirements 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could incur fines or private damage awards 
we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow  results of operations and ability to pay distributions to you 
we often need to borrow money to finance our business 
our ability to internally fund operating or capital needs is limited since we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains to stockholders to qualify as a reit 
consequently  we may have to borrow money to fund operating or capital needs or to satisfy the distribution requirements  imposed by the code  to maintain status as a reit 
borrowing money to fund operating or capital needs exposes us to various risks 
for example  the investment properties may not generate enough cash to pay the principal and interest obligations on loans or we may violate a loan covenant that results in the lender accelerating the maturity date of a loan 
as of december   we owed a total of approximately  secured by mortgages on our investment properties and our unsecured line of credit with keybank 
if we fail to make timely payments on loans  including those cases where a len der has accelerated the maturity date due to a violation of a loan covenant  the lenders could foreclose on the investment properties securing the loan and we could lose our entire investment on any foreclosed properties 
once a loan becomes due  we must either pay the remaining balance or borrow additional money to pay off the maturing loan 
we may not  however  be able to obtain a new loan  or the terms of the new loan  such as the interest rate or payment schedule  may not be as favorable as the terms of the maturing loan 
thus  we may be forced to sell a property at an unfavorable price to pay off the maturing loan or agree to less favorable loan terms 
in addition  we have limited availability under our keybank line of credit which may reduce our ability to borrow funds 
a total of approximately  and  of our indebtedness matures on or before december  and  respectively 
as of december   we owed approximately  on indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates 
we may borrow additional amounts that bear interest at variable rates 
if interest rates increase  the amount of interest that we would be required to pay on these borrowings will also increase 
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition 
the mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage 
our unsecured line of credit contains customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness  including total debt to asset ratios  secured debt to total asset ratios  debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt  which we must maintain 
our continued ability to borrow under our line of credit is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement  and we may then be required to repay this debt with capital from other s ources 
under those circumstances  other sources of capital may not be available to us  or be available only on unattractive terms 
additionally  in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms 
we rely on debt financing  including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and debt secured by individual properties  to finance our acquisition activities and for working capital 
if we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources  or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity  our financial condition  results of operations and ability to pay distributions to you would likely be adversely affected 
if we breach covenants in our debt agreements  the lenders can declare a default and  if the debt is secured  can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan 
defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and ability to pay distributions to you 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had approximately  in total indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt 
debt to market capitalization ratio  which measures total debt as a percentage of the aggregate of total debt plus the market value of outstanding equity securities is often used by analysts to gauge leverage for reits such as us 
since the listing of our shares on the new york stock exchange  our market value is calculated using the price per share of our common stock 
our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately as of december  our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes 
our degree of leverage could also make u s more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally 
in addition  a greater amount of debt relative to our peer group could have a negative effect on our stock price 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current stockholders 
the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future acquisitions or to repay indebtedness 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
we may fail to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would not be allowed to deduct amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing taxable income and would incur substantially greater expenses for taxes and have less money available to distribute 
we would also be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates as well as potentially the alternative minimum tax 
unless we satisfied some exception  we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during in which we were disqualified 
we may fail to qualify as a reit if  among other things less than of the value of our total assets consists of cash and cash items including receivables  real estate assets including mortgages and interests in mortgages and government securities at the close of each fiscal quarter  any one security owned represents more than of the value of our total assets  however  up to of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries  we own more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the value of the outstanding securities of a single issuer other than securities in a taxable reit subsidiary  less than of our gross income excluding income from prohibited transactions is derived from real estate sources 
these sources include mortgage interest  rents from real property  amounts received as consideration to enter into real estate leases or to make a loan secured by a mortgage and gains from the sale of real estate assets  or we fail to distribute at least of reit taxable income  which does not include the deduction for distributions paid and net capital gains  to stockholders 
in order to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions 
in order to maintain our reit status  we may need to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements  even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 
to qualify as a reit  we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  which does not include the deduction for distributions paid and net capital gains  each year 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
we may need short term debt or long term debt  proceeds from asset sales  creation of joint ventures or sale of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes  or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 
changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
since the listing of our shares on the new york stock exchange  the value of our shares  like other publicly traded equity securities  depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that could affect the value of our common stock are the following the extent of investor interest in our securities  the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  material economic concerns  changes in tax laws  our financial performance  and general stock and bond market conditions 
the market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
consequently  our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share of common stock 
if our future earnings or cash distributions are less than expected  it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish 
we face possible adverse changes in tax laws 
from time to time  changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted  which may result in an increase in our tax liability 
the shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of these changes 
if these changes occur  we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income and may be assessed interest and penalties on such additional taxes 
these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and the amount of cash available to pay distributions to you 
property taxes may increase 
we are required to pay taxes based on the assessed value of our investment properties determined by various taxing authorities such as state or local governments 
these taxing authorities may increase the tax rate imposed on a property or may reassess property value  either of which would increase the amount of taxes due on that property 
third parties may be discouraged from making acquisition or other proposals that may be in stockholders best interests 
under our governing documents  no single person or group of persons an entity is considered a person may own more than of our outstanding shares of common stock unless permitted by the board 
these provisions may prevent or discourage a third party from making a tender offer or other business combination proposal such as a merger  even if such a proposal would be in the best interest of the stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   and we had no derivative instruments 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument will reduce that exposure 
if a derivative terminates or is sold  the gain or loss is recognized 
we will only enter into derivative transactions that satisfy the aforementioned criteria 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt consists of variable interest rate loans 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques  including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt 
also  existing fixed and variable rate loans that are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing and or extension due to consideration given to current interest rates 
the table below presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  including monthly annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
thereafter fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate variable rate debt weighted average interest rate the table above reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december   and does not reflect indebtedness incurred after that date 
our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of the adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
the fair value of mortgages payable is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties 
the fair value of our mortgages  including our line of credit  is estimated to be  for mortgages which bear interest at variable rates and  for mortgages which bear interest at fixed rates 
we estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by our lenders 
at december   approximately  or of our mortgages payable  have variable interest rates averaging 
an increase in the variable interest rates charged on mortgages payable containing variable interest rate terms  constitutes a market risk 
a annualized increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately
