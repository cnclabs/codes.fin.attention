capital standards 
the frb  fdic and other federal banking agencies have established risk based capital adequacy guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of a bank s capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
since december   the federal banking agencies have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of  and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio

table of contents prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more of the prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the law requires each federal banking agency to promulgate regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed  based on the level of its capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the company and bank are classified as well capitalized under the guidelines promulgated by the federal reserve bank under regulation h and regulation y 
safety and soundness standards 
fdicia also implemented certain specific restrictions on transactions and required the regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting and documentation  and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  the use of brokered deposits and the aggregate extension of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest  and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts 
restrictions on dividends and other distributions 
the company s ability to pay dividends depends in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
the power of the board of directors of an insured depository institution to declare a cash dividend or other distribution with respect to capital is subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions which limit the amount available for such distribution depending upon the earnings  financial condition and cash needs of the institution  as well as general business conditions 
the approval of the mississippi department of banking and consumer finance is also required prior to the bank paying dividends 
the department s regulations limit dividends to earned surplus in excess of three times the bank s capital stock 
at december   the maximum amount available for transfer from the bank to the company in the form of a dividend was  or of the bank s consolidated net assets

the bank s deposits are insured through bif except for those deposits the bank acquired from the resolution trust corporation in april  this acquisition consisted of one branch of the former security federal savings and loan in kosciusko  mississippi  and these deposits remain insured through the saif

other bhc act provisions the bhc act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the frb before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority owned by such bank holding company 
the bhc act provides that the frb shall not approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation which would result in a monopoly or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking 
the frb also will not approve any other transactions in which the effect might be to substantially lessen competition or in any manner be a restraint on trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the bhc act also prohibits a bank holding company  with certain exceptions  from itself engaging in or from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in non banking activities 
the principal exception to this rule is for engaging in or acquiring shares of a company whose activities are found by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
in making such determinations  the frb is required to consider whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public such as greater convenience  increased competition  or gains in efficiency of resources that outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects such as decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 
the bhc act prohibits the acquisition by a bank holding company of more than of the outstanding voting shares of a bank located outside the state in which the operations of its banking subsidiaries are principally conducted  unless such an acquisition is specifically authorized by statute of the state in which the bank to be acquired is located 
the company and the bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act and the federal deposit insurance act on any extensions of credit to the company or the bank  on investments in the stock or other securities of the company or the bank  and on taking such stock or other securities as collateral for loans of any borrower

community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act of  as amended cra  requires the assessment by the appropriate regulatory authority of a financial institution s record in meeting the credit needs of the local community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the regulations promulgated under cra emphasize an assessment of actual performance in meeting local credit needs  rather than of the procedures followed by a bank  to evaluate compliance with the cra 
cra compliance is also a factor in evaluations of proposed mergers  acquisitions and applications to open new branches or facilities 
overall cra compliance is rated across a four point scale from outstanding to substantial noncompliance 
different evaluation methods are used depending on the asset size of the bank 
the fdic examined the bank on august  and again most recently on august   for its performance under the cra

table of contents impact of monetary policies 
banking is a business that substantially depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate earned by banks on loans  securities and other interest earning assets comprises the major source of banks earnings 
thus  the earnings and growth of banks are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies including the frb 
the nature and timing of any future changes in such policies and their impact on the company cannot be predicted 
competition the banking business is highly competitive 
the company s market area consists principally of neshoba  newton  leake  scott  attala  lauderdale  winston and kemper counties in mississippi 
the company competes with other financial institutions in these counties and in surrounding counties in mississippi in obtaining deposits and providing many types of financial services 
the company also competes with larger regional banks for the business of companies located in the company s market area 
all financial institutions  including the company  compete for customers deposits 
the company competes with savings and loan associations  credit unions  production credit associations  federal land banks  finance companies  personal loan companies  money market funds and other non depository financial intermediaries 
many of these financial institutions have resources many times greater than those of the company 
in addition  new financial intermediaries such as money market mutual funds and large retailers are not subject to the same regulations and laws that govern the operation of traditional depository institutions 
the company believes it benefits from a good reputation in the community and from the significant length of time it has provided needed banking services to its customers 
also  as a locally owned financial institution  the company believes it is able to respond to the needs of the community with services tailored to the particular demands of its customers 
furthermore  as a local institution  the company believes it can provide these services faster than a larger institution not based in the company s market area 
recent changes in federal and state law have resulted in  and are expected to continue to result in  increased competition 
the reductions in legal barriers to the acquisition of banks by out of state bank holding companies resulting from implementation of the interstate act and other recent and proposed changes in banking laws and regulations are expected to continue to further stimulate competition in the markets in which the company operates  although it is not possible to predict the extent or timing of such increased competition 
currently  there are approximately fourteen different financial institutions in the company s market area competing for the same customer base 
as of june   the company s market share in its market area was approximately 
the company competes in its market for loan and deposit products  along with many of the other services required by today s banking customer  on the basis of availability  quality and pricing 
the company believes it is able to compete favorably in its markets  in terms of both the rates we offer and the level of service that we provide to our customers

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k and the exhibits hereto  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
the risks disclosed below  either alone or in combination  could materially adversely affect the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our business and industry we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon the net interest income of the company 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets  such as loans and securities  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the frb 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  which could reduce the amount of fee income generated  ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income could be adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect our earnings 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the results of operations of the company  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
volatility in interest rates may also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from financial 
table of contents institutions into direct investments  such as us government and agency securities and other investment vehicles  including mutual funds  which generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements 
disintermediation could also result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of the policies and procedures used to identify  assess and manage certain interest rate risk is set forth in item a  qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
we are subject to lending risk 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the united states 
increases in interest rates and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans due primarily to the large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient 
although we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry  management also maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on management s quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collective impairment 
among other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses  management considers economic conditions reflected within industry segments  the unemployment rate in our markets  loan segmentation  and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of the policies and procedures related to management s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is set forth in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bank holding companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we often rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the ability of the company to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although management has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review during the loan application process and also before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the profitability of the company depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of mississippi 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of mississippi and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in east central mississippi 
the local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 

table of contents the earnings of bank holding companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
in addition to the risks associated with the general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate  our operations and profitability are also impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate  all of which are beyond our control 
a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non performing assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services  among other things  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the information under the heading competition in item  business  provides more information regarding the competitive conditions in our markets 
our industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than us  including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand the company s market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 

table of contents failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
the company and the bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not the economic or other interests of shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of the foregoing  could affect the company and or the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  the company and the bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
if we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework could affect the confidence of our customers in us  thus compromising our competitive position 
in addition  failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework or well managed under regulatory examination procedures could compromise our status as a bank holding company and related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals 
we are also subject to laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes act and new sec regulations 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could also result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and or civil money penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
