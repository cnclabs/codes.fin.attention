item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and highlights we are a specialized finance company providing loans to small and medium sized businesses 
we also selectively make equity investments  engage in asset management and servicing activities and invest in residential mortgage assets 
we intend to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit in through our commercial lending activities  our primary goal is to be the lender of choice for small and medium sized businesses with annual revenues generally ranging from million to million that require customized and sophisticated debt financing 
since our inception in september  we have operated through three principal commercial lending businesses structured finance  which generally engages in commercial and residential real estate lending and also provides asset based lending to finance companies  healthcare and specialty finance  which generally provides asset based revolving lines of credit  first mortgage loans  equipment financing and other senior and mezzanine loans to healthcare businesses and a broad range of other companies  and corporate finance  which generally provides senior and mezzanine loans principally to businesses backed by private equity sponsors 
although we make loans greater than million  our loans generally range from million to million  with an average loan size as of december  of million  and generally have a maturity of two to five years 
substantially all of our loans require monthly interest payments at variable rates 
in many cases  our loans provide for interest rate floors that help us maintain our yields when interest rates are low or declining 
during  we closed on loans representing aggregate commitments of billion 
the primary driver of our results of operations and financial condition has been our growth since inception 
our portfolio of interest earning assets  which consists primarily of loans  grew to billion as of december  from billion as of december  and generated a gross yield of for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we earned net income of million  or per diluted share  a increase compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in for the year ended december   we earned returns on average assets and average equity of and  respectively 
reit election in september  after a thorough analysis of our competitive landscape and market position  we announced our intention to elect to be taxed as a reit commencing in our decision to operate as a reit represents an evolution of our strategy  as real estate based lending has comprised a significant percentage of our origination activities since inception 
as a reit  we will continue to offer each of our traditional lending products  including corporate loans through our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss 
we believe that our after tax returns on our real estate based lending products will be enhanced by our new structure because  as a reit  the earnings from these products that we distribute to our shareholders generally will not be subject to corporate level tax 
in addition  we intend to expand into complementary real estate based products and services that we consider natural extensions of our historical loan product offerings and services 
due to the efficiencies inherent in the reit structure  we believe that we can originate these complementary  and generally lower yielding  real estate based products and continue to attain our targeted return on our equity 
internal reorganization to prepare for our operation as a reit  in december we divided our loan portfolio by separating the majority of our real estate based loans  which constitute qualifying reit assets  from our other assets 
we now hold our non real estate based loans in trss 
the earnings we derive from our trs operations will continue to be subject to corporate level tax 
going forward  we expect that we will fund qualifying reit assets through cse mortgage llc and its subsidiaries  and will fund non qualifying assets through capitalsource trs inc and its subsidiaries 
the following diagram illustrates our current organizational structure graph we believe that this internal restructuring  like our reit election itself  has been transparent to our clients and will not materially affect our day to day operations 
we do not anticipate that our existing origination  servicing and underwriting operations will materially change as a result of our reit election and internal restructuring 
the employees who conduct these operations are employees of capitalsource finance llc capitalsource finance  a wholly owned subsidiary of capitalsource trs inc commencing in january  we will pay capitalsource finance a management fee for services rendered to us  calculated and paid monthly in arrears  in an amount equal to of the month end value of our shareholders equity  computed in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  adjusted to exclude the effects of any unrealized gains  losses or other items that do not affect realized net income  our direct or indirect ownership interest in our trss  and one time events affecting the computation of equity as a result of changes in gaap 
in addition  the management fee payable will be reduced by all amounts paid during a particular month to capitalsource finance by any client in respect of the origination or servicing of any investment in qualifying reit assets we make or propose to make 
the management fee will be eliminated in consolidation in accordance with gaap 
earnings and profits dividend as required by reit tax rules  we declared a special dividend of per share  or million in the aggregate  representing our estimate at that time of our cumulative undistributed earnings and profits  including earnings and profits of some of our predecessor entities  from our inception through december  holders of record were given the opportunity to elect to receive their special dividend in cash  stock or a combination of cash and stock 
in january  we paid this special dividend million in cash and million in stock 
to the extent we determine that this special dividend did not include all of our cumulative undistributed earnings and profits through december   we intend to dividend any additional amounts prior to december  residential mortgage investment strategy to facilitate compliance with reit qualification rules and to begin to optimize the value of the reit structure  we began investing in residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
during the fourth quarter  we purchased billion of fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage backed pass through certificates backed by conforming prime mortgage loans that were originated as hybrid adjustable rate mortgages 
we financed approximately of the aggregate purchase price for these securities through repurchase agreements 
see off balance sheet risk below and note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for a discussion of the accounting treatment for these mortgage backed securities and related repurchase agreements as of december  subsequent to year end  we purchased an additional billion of residential mortgage backed securities using similar repurchase agreement leverage and purchased approximately billion in residential prime whole loans which we financed with approximately billion of debt issued in securitizations 
while these residential mortgage assets are lower yielding than the assets we originate in our core commercial lending activities  our strategy is to purchase these residential mortgage assets to help us meet the asset and income tests with which reits are required to comply  to further diversify our asset portfolio and  by using appropriate leverage  to generate what we believe to be modest risk adjusted returns in a tax efficient reit structure 
goals for operating as a reit this will be our first year operating as a reit 
we expect to invest significant resources in in real estate based lending opportunities  particularly as we develop our new  complementary loan product offerings  including sale leaseback financings 
in addition  we anticipate that in we will devote more management resources to monitoring our reit status  as complying with the various asset and income tests is particularly challenging for mortgage reits 
while we believe our expenses generally will continue to decrease as a percentage of our average total assets  as we continue to monitor our operating expenses and spread these expenses over a growing portfolio of assets  it will be our goal to minimize the costs  including opportunity costs  of these investments in our future operations as a reit 
developing our residential mortgage investment business we intend to continue to expand our residential mortgage investment business through additional hiring and other investments as necessary to enable us to comply with reit qualification rules 
the addition of this business poses operational challenges  as the underwriting  origination and asset management models for our residential mortgage investment business differ from the models we have traditionally deployed in our commercial lending business 
these differences may produce some difficulties  at least initially  until our employees gain familiarity with the models for our new business 
our shareholders  too  may require time to get acclimated to the addition of our new business  as our overall net yield will decline as we purchase additional residential mortgage assets which typically involve lower risk  and thus lower yields  than the assets we traditionally have originated through our commercial lending business 
accessing external funding since inception  our commercial lending business has depended on our access to external sources of financing and the cost of such funds 
we have funded our business through a combination of repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  secured term debt transactions accounted for as on balance sheet financings  convertible debt  subordinated debt  equity and retained earnings 
going forward  we expect to depend on external sources of capital more than we have in the past 
this dependency results  in part  from the fact that we will be required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our reit taxable income to qualify as a reit  including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash  and we will be required to distribute of our reit taxable income in order to eliminate federal income tax on our reit taxable income 
we are not required to distribute the taxable income related to our trss and  therefore  have the flexibility to retain these earnings 
during  we intend to pay dividends equal to of the reit s taxable income  which will include any dividends we receive from our trss 
we intend to cause our trss to pay dividends to us in an amount equal to of their taxable income net of taxes paid by the trss  subject to the reit gross income limitations 
if we are limited in the amount of dividends we can receive from our trss in  we intend to use other sources of cash to fund dividend payments that would equal of our reit and trss taxable income net of our trss tax liability 
even though we plan on distributing our trss earnings in the form of dividends to our shareholders  the ability to retain these earnings represents an important measure of financial flexibility 
in addition  our residential mortgage investment business requires the development of additional external funding sources and is characterized by significantly higher leverage than our traditional commercial lending business 
our financing goal is to maintain balanced and diverse funding sources while minimizing our cost of funds 
in addition to our intention to raise equity capital upon time to time  we plan to continue to finance our business primarily with debt 
to that end  we will seek to manage our overall level of leverage both through existing and new sources of debt capital 
existing sources of debt capital for our commercial lending activities include warehouse credit facilities  term debt securitizations  repurchase agreements and the issuance of subordinated debt 
we also plan to raise debt capital through sources that we have not previously accessed such as unsecured credit facilities  senior and subordinated unsecured term debt and deposits at capitalsource bank  our wholly owned utah industrial bank subsidiary  assuming it receives fdic approval and commences operations 
moreover  we expect to continue to rely primarily on repurchase agreements  owner trust transactions and other funding sources to grow our residential mortgage investment business 
as a result of these financing activities  we expect our overall leverage to increase during consolidated results of operations our consolidated revenue consists of interest and fees from our loans  interest on our residential mortgage investments and  to a lesser extent  other income which includes unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments and derivatives  gains losses on the sale of equity interests and other investments  third party loan servicing income  income from fee generating business and deposits forfeited by our prospective borrowers 
our expenses consist principally of interest expense on our borrowings and operating expenses  which include compensation and employee benefits and other administrative expenses 
explanation of key reporting metrics interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our loans 
the majority of our loans charge interest at variable rates that generally adjust daily 
during  we began increasing the number of loans we hold that charge interest at fixed rates 
as of december   of our loans had fixed rates of interest 
fee income 
fee income represents net fee income earned from our loan operations 
fee income includes the amortization of loan origination fees  net of the direct costs of origination  the amortization of original issue discount  the amortization of the discount or premium on loans acquired  the amortization of fees related to syndicated loans that we originate and other fees charged to borrowers 
we amortize these loan fees into income over the life of our loans and do not take loan fees into income when a loan closes 
loan prepayments may materially affect fee income since  in the period of prepayment  the amortization of remaining net loan origination fees and discounts is accelerated and prepayment penalties may be assessed on the prepaid loans and recognized in the period of the prepayment 
we consider both the acceleration of any unamortized fees and fees related to prepayment penalties to be prepayment related fee income 
interest expense 
interest expense is the amount paid on borrowings  including the amortization of deferred financing fees 
with the exception of our convertible debt and two series of our subordinated debt  which bear a fixed rate of interest  all of our borrowings charge interest at variable rates based primarily on day libor or commercial paper rates plus a margin 
as our borrowings increase and as short term interest rates rise  our interest expense will increase 
deferred financing fees and the costs of acquiring debt  such as commitment fees and legal fees  are amortized over the shorter of either the first call period or the contractual maturity of the borrowing 
loan prepayments may materially affect interest expense on our term debt since in the period of prepayment the amortization of remaining deferred financing fees and debt acquisition costs is accelerated 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses inherent in our portfolio 
as the size of our portfolio changes  the mix of loans within our portfolio changes  or if the credit quality of the portfolio changes  we record a provision to appropriately adjust the allowance for loan losses 
other income 
other income expense consists of gains losses on the sale of debt and equity investments  unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  gains losses on derivatives  including our forward commitment to purchase mortgage backed securities  gains losses on our residential mortgage investments  due diligence deposits forfeited  fees associated with the united states department of housing and urban development  or hud  origination activities  third party servicing income and other miscellaneous fees and expenses not attributable to our loan operations 
operating expenses 
operating expenses include compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  rent  insurance  depreciation and amortization  marketing and other general and administrative expenses 
income taxes 
although we plan to elect reit status for  we were responsible for paying federal  state and local income taxes on all of our income through december  deferred tax liabilities and assets have been reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book value and the tax basis of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates scheduled to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we expect to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code for the year commencing january  provided we qualify as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level tax on the income we derive from the reit qualifying assets if that income is distributed to shareholders  but we will still be subject to corporate level tax on any undistributed earnings from our reit qualifying assets and on the earnings from our trs activities 
in addition  provided we qualify as a reit  we anticipate that net deferred tax liabilities relating to reit qualifying activities will no longer be required and will be reversed during the first quarter of operating results for the years ended december   and our results of operations continue to be driven primarily by our rapid growth 
the most significant factors influencing our results of operations for the years ended december   and described in this section were significant growth in our commercial loan portfolio  increased loan loss reserves  increased borrowings to fund our growth  increased operating expenses  consisting primarily of higher employee compensation directly related to increases in the number of employees necessary to originate and manage our commercial lending portfolio and our residential mortgage investment portfolio  increased short term interest rates and  decreased lending and borrowing spreads 
our consolidated operating results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows year ended year ended december  december  change change change change in thousands in thousands interest income fee income interest expense provision for loan losses operating expenses other income income taxes net income comparison of the years ended december  and interest income the increase in interest income was due to the growth in average interest earning assets of billion  or  as well as an increase in the interest component of yield to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest earning assets increased during primarily from the growth in loans in our commercial lending portfolio 
the increase in the interest component of yield was largely due to the increase in short term interest rates  offset by a decrease in our lending spread 
during  our overall lending spread to the average prime rate was compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in lending spread reflects both the increase in competition in our markets as well as the changing mix of our commercial lending portfolio toward a greater percentage of asset based and real estate loans 
fluctuations in yields are driven by a number of factors including the coupon on new loan originations  the coupon on loans that pay down or pay off and the effect of external interest rates 
fee income the increase in fee income was primarily the result of the growth in interest earning assets as well as an increase in prepayment fees  which aggregated million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  yield from fee income decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to lower prepayment and other fees relative to the growth of average interest earning assets 
interest expense we fund our growth largely through borrowings 
consequently  the increase in our interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of billion  or  as well as rising interest rates during the period 
our cost of borrowings increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was the result of rising interest rates and an increase in amortization of deferred financing fees due to additional financings and higher loan prepayments in our term debt securitizations  partially offset by lower borrowing margins and our use of more cost effective sources of financing 
our overall borrowing spread to average day libor for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  net interest margin net interest margin  defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decline of basis points from for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in interest expense resulting from a higher cost of funds and higher leverage  offset partially by an increase in yield 
net interest spread  the difference between our gross yield on interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest and fee income divided by our average interest earning assets 
the decrease in net interest spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
the yields of interest earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  interest and interest and weighted fee income average weighted fee income average average interest yield average interest yield balance expense cost balance expense cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread net interest margin net yield on interest earning assets interest earning assets include cash  restricted cash  mortgage backed securities accounted for on a gross basis  loans and investments in debt securities 
interest bearing liabilities include repurchase agreements accounted for on a gross basis  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
provision for loan losses the increase in the provision for loan losses is the result of the growth in our loan portfolio  the increase in the balance of impaired loans in the portfolio and a change in our loan loss reserve estimates 
during the year ended december   we changed our loan loss reserve policy  which included increasing our loan loss reserve estimates based on revised reserve factors by loan type that consider historical loss experience  the seasoning of our portfolio  overall economic conditions and other factors 
other income the increase in other income was primarily due to an increase in gain on investments  net of million and the recognition of gains on the sale of loans of million occurring during  partially offset by a decrease in fees arising from our hud mortgage origination services of million and an increase in loss on derivatives of million 
operating expenses the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher total employee compensation  which increased million  or 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to an increase in employees to as of december  from as of december   as well as higher incentive compensation  including an increase in restricted stock awards granted during a significant portion of employee compensation is composed of annual bonuses and restricted stock awards  which generally have a three to five year vesting period 
during  we established a variable methodology for employee bonuses partially based on the performance of the company  pursuant to which we accrued for employee bonuses throughout the year 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter  we reversed million of accrued incentive compensation that was recorded in the first three quarters of this reversal was made to align overall incentive compensation  for our chief executive officer and our vice chairman and chief investment officer with financial performance targets 
the remaining million increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was attributable to an increase of million in professional fees incurred in connection with our reit election plan  an increase of million in rent  an increase of million in travel and entertainment  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization and an increase of million in other general business expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio  which represents operating expenses as a percentage of our net interest and fee income and other income  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvements in operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets and the efficiency ratio were attributable to controlling our operating expenses and spreading those expenses over a growing portfolio of loans 
the improvement in our efficiency ratio also partially resulted from the significant increase in our net interest and fee income 
income taxes we provided for income taxes on the income earned for the year ended december  based on a effective tax rate compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended december  comparison of the years ended december  and interest income the increase in interest income was due to the growth in average interest earning assets  primarily loans  of billion  or  partially offset by a decrease in the interest component of yield of for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  fluctuations in yields are driven by a number of factors including the coupon on new originations  the coupon on loans that pay down or pay off and the effect of external interest rates 
fee income the increase in fee income was primarily due to two factors 
first  the recognition of greater prepayment fee income associated with the accelerated amortization of deferred net origination fees and loan discounts and prepayment fees which aggregated million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the remaining million increase in fee income was due to the overall growth in interest earning assets 
interest expense we fund our growth largely through borrowings 
consequently  the increase in our interest expense was primarily due to an increase in borrowings as well as rising interest rates during the year 
in  our borrowings increased billion  or 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our cost of borrowings resulting from more cost effective financings 
net interest margin net interest margin  defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decline of basis points from for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to the increase in interest expense resulting from higher leverage 
net interest spread  the difference between our gross yield on interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest and fee income divided by our average interest earning assets 
the decrease in net interest spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
the yields of interest earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  interest and interest and weighted fee income average weighted fee income average average interest yield average interest yield balance expense cost balance expense cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread net interest margin net yield on interest earning assets interest earning assets include loans  cash and restricted cash 
interest bearing liabilities include credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and repurchase agreements 
provision for loan losses the increase in the provision reflected the growth and the seasoning of the portfolio and an increase in the balance of impaired loans in the portfolio 
another factor contributing to the increase in the provision was the change in composition of our portfolio by loan type 
during  senior secured cash flow loans and mezzanine loans increased at a faster rate than the rest of our portfolio 
senior secured cash flow loans and mezzanine loans have higher inherent losses than other loans in our portfolio 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded specific reserves of million and million  respectively  for loans which we considered to be impaired 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including principal and scheduled interest payments 
other income the decrease in other income for the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in gain on investments to million from million for the year ended december  due primarily to the gain on sale of our equity interest in medcap properties llc of million recognized in partially offsetting this decrease was the increase of million in fees arising from our activities in originating federally insured mortgage loans  the addition of million in third party servicing fees and an increase of million in diligence deposits forfeited 
operating expenses the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher total employee compensation  which increased million  or 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to the increase in employees during to as of december  from as of december   as well as higher incentive compensation relating to the growth in our operating profits 
a significant portion of employee compensation is composed of annual bonuses 
during  we established a variable methodology for employee bonuses partially based on the performance of the company  pursuant to which we accrued for employee bonuses throughout the year 
for the years ended december  and  bonus expense totaled million and million  respectively 
the remaining million increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was attributable to an increase of million in professional fees  million in travel and entertainment expenses  million in rent  million in insurance and million in other general business expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio  which represents operating expenses as a percentage of our net interest and fee income and other income  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvements in operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets and the efficiency ratio were attributable to controlling our operating expenses and spreading those expenses over a growing portfolio of loans 
the improvement in our efficiency ratio also partially resulted from the significant increase in our net interest and fee income 
income taxes we provided for income taxes on the income earned for the year ended december  based on a effective tax rate 
we provided for income taxes on the income earned from august  to december  based on a effective tax rate 
prior to our reorganization as a c corporation on august   we operated as a limited liability company and all income taxes were paid by the members 
at the reorganization date  we recorded a million net deferred tax asset and corresponding deferred tax benefit which lowered the effective tax rate 
since we were not a taxpayer prior to august  and due to the one time deferred tax benefit  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was financial condition commercial lending portfolio commercial lending portfolio composition the composition of our commercial loan portfolio by loan type and by commercial lending business as of december  and was as follows december  in thousands composition of portfolio by loan type senior secured asset based loans first mortgage loans senior secured cash flow loans mezzanine loans total composition of portfolio by lending business structured finance healthcare and specialty finance corporate finance total includes term b loans 
our security alarm industry loans have been included in our healthcare and specialty finance business since january  and were previously in our structured finance business as of december  we may have more than one loan to a client and its related entities 
for purposes of determining the portfolio statistics in this section  we count each loan or client separately and do not aggregate loans to related entities 
the number of loans  average loan size  number of clients and average loan size per client by commercial lending business as of december  were as follows average loan number average number of size per of loans loan size clients client in thousands composition of portfolio by lending business structured finance healthcare and specialty finance corporate finance overall portfolio the scheduled maturities of our commercial loan portfolio by type as of december  were as follows due in due in one year one to due after or less five years five years total in thousands scheduled maturities by loan type senior secured asset based loans first mortgage loans senior secured cash flow loans mezzanine loans total the dollar amounts of all fixed rate and adjustable rate loans by loan type as of december  were as follows adjustable fixed rates rates total in thousands composition of portfolio by loan type senior secured asset based loans first mortgage loans senior secured cash flow loans mezzanine loans total percentage of total portfolio as of december   our structured finance  healthcare and specialty finance and corporate finance businesses had commitments to lend up to an additional billion  billion and billion  respectively  to  and existing clients  respectively 
in anticipation of our election to be taxed as a reit beginning in  we expect that our mix of outstanding loans will change over the course of the next year 
for instance  we anticipate that we will make more fixed rate and lower leverage mortgage loans as well as engage in sale leaseback transactions  in which we buy a client s real property and lease it back to the client over a long term lease 
in addition  we expect that with our broader array of lending products and the increase in our profile that comes from our reit status  we may attract more clients interested in our real estate lending products 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses as of december  and  the principal balance of loans or more days contractually delinquent  non accrual loans and impaired loans were as follows december  asset classification in thousands loans or more days contractually delinquent non accrual loans impaired loans less loans in multiple categories total total as a percentage of total loans includes loans with an aggregate principal balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which were also classified as loans or more days contractually delinquent 
includes loans with an aggregate principal balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which were also classified as loans or more days contractually delinquent  and loans with an aggregate principal balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which were also classified as loans on non accrual status 
as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement  including principal and scheduled interest payments 
pursuant to sfas no 
 impaired loans include loans for which we expect to have a credit loss and other loans that are definitionally impaired  but for which we do not currently expect to have a credit loss 
for the year ended december   loans with an aggregate carrying value of million as of december  were classified as troubled debt restructurings as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
as of december   these loans were also classified as impaired loans since  under sfas no 
 loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are also classified as impaired loans generally for a period of at least one year following the restructuring 
the allocated reserve for loans classified as troubled debt restructurings was million as of december  for the year ended december   loans with an aggregate carrying value of million as of december  were classified as troubled debt restructurings 
the allocated reserve for loans classified as troubled debt restructurings was million as of december  we have provided an allowance for loan losses to cover estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses was million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts equate to and of gross loans as of december  and  respectively 
this increase is due to an increase in the provision for loan losses resulting from the change made to our loan loss reserve estimates during the third quarter and an increase in impaired loans  partially offset by loan charge offs 
during the years ended december  and  we charged off loans totaling million and million  respectively 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
of our total allowance for loan losses as of december  and  million and million was allocated to impaired loans 
middle market lending involves credit risks which we believe will result in further credit losses in our portfolio 
investments we invest in equity interests  typically in connection with a loan to a client 
these investments include common stock  preferred stock  limited liability company interests  limited partnership interests and warrants to purchase equity instruments 
during the year ended december   we also purchased investments in debt securities 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our investments was million and million  respectively 
this increase resulted from million in additional investments  including purchases of investments in debt securities of million  net of discounts  offset by million from sales of investments and return of capital and the recognition of million in unrealized losses on our investments 
as of december   investments totaling million were carried at fair value with increases and decreases recorded in other income expense 
as of december   we had commitments to contribute up to an additional million to private equity funds  million to a joint venture and million to an equity investment 
residential mortgage investment portfolio in connection with our efforts to qualify as a reit  we invest directly in residential mortgage investments that qualify as reit eligible assets 
as of december   our portfolio of residential mortgage investments consisted of billion in residential mortgage backed securities 
these securities are guaranteed as to principal and interest by freddie mac or fannie mae 
as of december   our portfolio comprised year  year and year hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the coupons on these securities are fixed until the initial reset date and then reset annually thereafter 
the weighted average coupon on our portfolio of mortgage backed securities was as of december  we have financed our investments to date in mortgage backed securities primarily through repurchase agreements 
as of december   our outstanding repurchase agreements totaled billion and had maturities of between and days and a weighted average interest rate of 
these repurchase agreements result in interest rates that may change more quickly than the interest rates earned on our residential mortgage investments 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of our interest rate risk management program related to our residential mortgage investment portfolio 
as of december   billion of our mortgage backed securities and billion of related repurchase agreements were recorded net on our consolidated balance sheet and a derivative was recorded related to our forward commitments to repurchase the mortgage backed securities 
our remaining mortgage backed securities and related repurchase agreements as of december  were recorded as an asset and a liability  respectively  on the balance sheet 
see further discussion of this accounting treatment in off balance sheet risk below and in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  which include funding our existing loan commitments and ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  acquiring residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  paying dividends and for other general business purposes 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of cash flows from operations  borrowings under our existing and future repurchase agreements  credit facilities and term debt securitizations  proceeds from issuances of common equity and other sources 
we believe these sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity needs 
in addition to expanding our access to our current sources of liquidity  potential sources of future liquidity for us include unsecured credit facilities  unsecured term debt and further issuances of common stock or other equity securities 
as of december   the amount of our unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients exceeded our unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by million 
we expect that our loan commitments will continue to exceed our available funds indefinitely 
our obligation to fund unfunded commitments generally is based on our client s ability to provide additional collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the additional collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements and our client s ability to meet certain other preconditions to borrowing 
provided our client s additional collateral meets all of the eligibility requirements of our funding sources  we believe that we have sufficient funding capacity to meet short term needs related to unfunded commitments 
if we do not have sufficient funding capacity to satisfy these commitments  our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract liability for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in anticipation of our reit election  we acquired a significant amount of residential mortgage backed securities  and we will likely acquire more residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in that will help us to satisfy the reit asset eligibility criteria 
as discussed below  we have funded these purchases primarily through repurchase agreements  credit facilities and securitizations  utilizing leverage consistent with industry standards for these assets 
we will determine our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements based on the growth rate of our portfolio and other assets 
additionally  as a reit  our growth must be funded largely by external sources of capital due to the requirement to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders to qualify as a reit 
we are not required to distribute the taxable income related to our trss and  therefore  have the flexibility to retain these earnings 
during  we intend to pay dividends equal to of the reit s taxable income  which will include any dividends we receive from our trss 
we intend to cause our trss to pay dividends to us in an amount equal to of their taxable income net of taxes paid by the trss  subject to the reit gross income limitations 
if we are limited in the amount of dividends we can receive from our trss in  we intend to use other sources of cash to fund dividend payments that would equal of our reit and trss taxable income net of our trss tax liability 
even though we plan on distributing our trss earnings in the form of dividends to our shareholders  the ability to retain these earnings represents an important measure of financial flexibility 
as a result  we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital from time to time to support our growth 
in addition to raising equity  we plan to continue to access the secured debt market for capital and to continue to explore additional sources of financing 
we expect these financings will include unsecured credit facilities  unsecured term debt  equity related securities such as convertible debt and or other financing sources 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will have access to any of these funding sources in the future 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in cash as of december  was primarily due to anticipated loan closings that did not occur by year end and loan collections and prepayments that were received just prior to year end 
we invest cash on hand in short term liquid investments that qualify as cash equivalents 
we generally fund new loan originations and growth in revolving loan balances using advances under our credit facilities 
for the year ended december   we used cash from operations of million 
for the years ended december  and  we generated cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively 
during  we purchased mortgage backed securities which had a fair value of million as of december  which are required to be included in cash used in operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows as these securities are classified as trading securities 
we financed these purchases of mortgage backed securities primarily through repurchase agreements 
in addition  we purchased million in loans held for sale that also are required to be included in cash used in operations 
during  we borrowed million under these repurchase agreements which are included in cash from financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and as described below 
proceeds from our equity offerings  borrowings on our repurchase agreements  credit facilities and term loans  the issuance of asset backed notes in our term debt transactions and the issuance of convertible debt and subordinated debt provide cash from financing activities 
for the years ended december   and  we generated cash flow from financing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
investing activities primarily relate to loan origination 
for the years ended december   and  we used cash in investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and  respectively 
the restricted cash represents principal and interest collections on loans collateralizing our term debt  collateral for letters of credit issued for the benefit of clients  interest collections on loans pledged to our credit facilities and other items such as client holdbacks and escrows 
interest rate swap payments  interest payable and servicing fees are deducted from the monthly interest collections funded by loans collateralizing our credit facilities and term debt  and the remaining restricted cash is returned to us and becomes unrestricted at that time 
borrowings as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings totaling billion and billion  respectively 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt have supported our growth 
for a detailed discussion of our borrowings  see note  borrowings  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  our funding sources  maximum facility amounts  amounts outstanding  and unused available commitments  subject to certain minimum equity requirements and other covenants and conditions as of december  were as follows maximum facility amount unused funding source amount outstanding capacity in thousands repurchase agreements credit facilities term debt convertible debt subordinated debt total repurchase agreements in the amount of billion used to finance purchases of mortgage backed securities from the same counterparty are not included in this amount 
for a discussion of the accounting treatment for these repurchase agreements as of december   see off balance sheet risk below and note  summary of significant accounting policies in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  million of this amount relates to financings of mortgage backed securities 
as of march   we had borrowed an additional million of principal under our credit facilities 
a credit facility with a principal balance of million is scheduled to mature on march  under one of these facilities 
we are currently in the process of renewing this facility and expect to have this renewal completed prior to its maturity 
should we be unable to renew this facility  the facility would be repaid with the scheduled payment proceeds under the loans collateralizing this facility 
another credit facility with a principal balance of million as of march  is scheduled to mature and is payable on may  we are currently in the process of renewing this facility and expect this renewal to be completed prior to its maturity 
should we be unable to renew the facility  we expect to be able to repay this amount from the proceeds of our next planned term debt securitization  which is scheduled to be completed by april  if we do not complete a term debt securitization  we believe we could utilize unused capacity under our other committed credit facilities to repay the principal outstanding at that date 
our term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt are one time fundings that do not provide any ability for us to draw down additional amounts 
our overall debt strategy emphasizes diverse sources of financing including both secured and unsecured financings as well as deposits  assuming our utah industrial bank receives fdic approval and commences operations 
as of december   approximately of our debt was collateralized by our loans and mortgage backed securities and was unsecured 
we intend to increase our percentage of unsecured debt over time through both unsecured credit facilities and unsecured term debt 
fitch ratings issued an investment grade rating to our senior debt during as we continue to grow  we expect to obtain investment grade ratings from other rating agencies and to improve these ratings over time 
as our ratings improve  we should be able to issue more unsecured debt relative to the amount of our secured debt 
in any case  we intend to maintain prudent levels of leverage and currently expect our debt to equity ratio on our commercial lending portfolio to remain below x 
repurchase agreements we are party to a million master repurchase agreement to finance healthcare mortgage loans originated in our commercial lending business 
to date  we have not used this facility to finance any loans 
we also use repurchase agreements to finance purchases of mortgage backed securities 
under each of these repurchase agreements  we are required to repurchase the financed mortgage backed securities on specific dates  unless either of the parties to the agreements notifies the other party that it desires to terminate the financing earlier 
these agreements also provide for various levels of recourse in the event of a default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement 
mortgage backed securities and cash collateralize these repurchase agreements as of december  for a discussion of the accounting treatment for these repurchase agreements as of december   see off balance sheet risk below and note  summary of significant accounting policies in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  substantially all of our repurchase agreements and related hedging instruments require us to deposit additional collateral in the event the market value of existing collateral declines  which may require us to sell assets to reduce our borrowings 
we have designed a policy to maintain a cushion of equity sufficient to provide required liquidity to respond to the effects under our repurchase agreements of interest rate movements and changes in the market value of our mortgage backed securities collateralizing the repurchase agreements 
however  a major disruption of the repurchase or other market that we rely on for short term borrowings would have a material adverse effect on us unless we were able to arrange alternative sources of financing on comparable terms 
credit facilities during the year ended december   we increased our committed credit facility capacity by billion to billion and subsequent to year end  increased this amount to billion of capacity of which an additional million of principal was drawn as of march  this increase in capacity resulted from the addition of four new credit facilities and a net increase in the total facility amount of our existing credit facilities 
we currently have eight secured credit facilities with nine financial institutions that we use to fund certain of our loans on a daily basis 
to date  many loans have been held  or warehoused  in these facilities until we complete a term debt transaction in which we securitize a pool of loans from our credit facilities 
we primarily use the proceeds from our term debt transactions to pay down our credit facilities  which results in increased capacity to redraw on them as needed 
availability under our credit facilities depends on each facility s borrowing base  which is typically equal to between and of the principal balance of loans transferred to the facilities 
as of december   billion of our committed facility capacity has scheduled maturity dates of between three months and five years  of which billion is subject to annual renewal 
one of our facilities totaling billion included in this amount  is subject to renewal by march  we are currently in process of renewing this facility and expect to have that renewal completed by march  if we were unable to renew that facility the terms of this existing credit facility allow us to repay it over a period that matches the underlying payment terms of the loans that collateralize this facility 
another credit facility with a principal balance of million as of march  is scheduled to mature and is payable on may  we expect to be able to repay this amount from the proceeds of our next planned term debt securitization  which is scheduled to be completed by april  if we do not complete a term securitization  we believe we could utilize unused capacity under our other committed credit facilities to repay the principal outstanding at that date 
in  subject to fdic approval and commencement of operations  we plan on transferring a significant amount of our loans to our utah industrial bank  and the bank will raise deposits with which to purchase these loans from us 
term debt through december   we had completed seven term debt transactions 
in conjunction with each transaction  we established separate single purpose trusts collectively referred to as the trusts  and contributed an aggregate of approximately billion in loans  or portions thereof  to the trusts 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  we will remain servicer of the loans 
simultaneously with the initial contributions  the trusts issued billion of notes to institutional investors 
we retained million in interest bearing and non interest bearing junior notes and of the trusts beneficial interests 
the notes are collateralized by all or portions of specific commercial loans  totaling billion principal amount as of december  we have treated the contribution of the loans to the trusts and the related sale of notes by the trusts as financing arrangements under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

of the junior notes that we hold  million will begin to receive principal cash flows under the asset securitization when the full principal balances of the respective senior notes have been retired 
the remaining million currently receive payments pro rata based on the respective original principal amounts of the classes of notes with respect to which such payments are made  provided  however  that upon the occurrence of specified events  cash flow on these notes will be paid sequentially rather than pro rata 
convertible debt we have outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due the march debentures and million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due july the july debentures 
until march  the march debentures will bear interest at a rate of  after which time the debentures will not bear interest 
effective march   the march debentures are convertible  subject to certain conditions described below  into shares of our common stock at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of debentures 
the conversion rate will adjust each time we pay a dividend on our common stock  with the fair value of each adjustment taxable to the holders 
the march debentures will be redeemable for cash at our option at any time on or after march  at a redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest

see note  borrowings  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion of these conditions 
to the extent that the respective conversion prices are adjusted below the price of our common stock at the time the march debentures or july debentures were issued  we would be required to record a beneficial conversion option which would impact both our net income and net income per share 
this has not occurred as of december  subordinated debt during  we issued million in subordinated debt to two newly formed statutory trusts  which issued an aggregate of million of preferred securities to outside investors 
we retained million of the trusts common securities 
the subordinated debt has terms substantially identical to those of the preferred securities issued by the trusts 
one series of subordinated debt is callable in whole or in part at par at any time after december  and matures on december   and the other is callable in whole or in part at par at any time after january  and matures on january  each series of subordinated debt is unsecured and ranks equally with each other  but subordinate and junior in right of payment to our other indebtedness  liabilities and obligations 
subsequent to year end  we issued an additional million in subordinated debt to a newly formed statutory trust  which issued an aggregate of million of preferred securities to outside investors 
we retained million of the trust s common securities 
the subordinated debt is callable in whole or in part at par at any time after april  and matures on april  the remaining terms of this series of subordinated debt are similar to the series of subordinated debt discussed above 
debt covenant compliance capitalsource finance  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  services loans collateralizing the credit facilities and term debt and must meet various financial and non financial covenants 
the notes under the trusts include accelerated amortization provisions that require cash flows to be applied to pay the noteholders if the notes remain outstanding beyond the stated maturity dates 
failure to meet the covenants could result in the servicing being transferred to a subservicer 
we also have certain non financial covenants on our other debt financings 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
equity offering in october  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share  raising net proceeds of million  million of which was raised through purchases by our officers and directors and affiliates thereof 
these proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our credit facilities  resulting in increased credit facility capacity to fund future portfolio growth

million of principal is scheduled to mature on march  under one of these facilities 
we are currently in the process of renewing this facility and expect to have this renewal completed prior to its maturity 
another credit facility with a principal balance of million as of march  which is not subject to annual renewal is scheduled to mature and is payable on may  we expect to be able to repay this amount from the proceeds of our next planned term debt securitization  which is expected to be completed by april  the contractual obligations for credit facilities are computed based on the stated maturities of the facilities not considering optional annual renewals 
the contractual obligations for term debt are computed based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loans pledged as collateral and assume a constant prepayment rate of 
the underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which would shorten the life of the term debt transactions 
the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which will lengthen the life of the term debt transactions 
at our option  we may substitute new loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt transactions 
also  the contractual obligations for our term debt transaction are computed based on the initial call date 
the contractual obligations for convertible debt are computed based on the initial put call date

term debt securitizations depending on the legal structure of the transaction  term debt securitizations may either be accounted for as off balance sheet with a gain or loss on the sale recorded in the statement of income or accounted for as on balance sheet financings 
all of our term debt transactions to date have been recorded as on balance sheet financings 
commitments and guarantees we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business primarily from commitments to extend credit 
as of december  and  we had unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients of billion and billion  respectively 
as of december  and  we had issued million and million  respectively  in letters of credit which expire at various dates over the next eight years 
these letters of credit may have the effect of creating  increasing or accelerating our borrowings 
if a borrower defaults on its commitment s subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements  we would be responsible to meet the borrower s financial obligation and would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower 
these arrangements qualify as a financial guarantee in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
these commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as the on balance sheet financial instruments we hold 
derivatives commercial lending portfolio we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of certain fixed rate loans from changes in day libor 
we also enter into additional basis swap agreements to eliminate basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these interest rate swap agreements modify our exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed rate and prime rate loans to day libor 
additionally  we use interest rate cap agreements to hedge loans with embedded interest rate caps that are pledged as collateral for our term debt 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the day libor based term debt 
the fair market value of these interest rate swap and basis swap agreements was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements was million as of december  or during the year ended december   we began using interest rate swaps to hedge certain of our fixed rate loans which were not pledged to our term debt 
the objective of these interest rate swaps is to protect these loans against changes in fair value due to changes in day libor 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was million as of december  during the year ended december   we also began using interest rate swaps to hedge certain of our fixed rate investments in debt securities 
the objective of these interest rate swaps is to protect these investments against changes in fair value due to changes in day libor 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was million as of december  derivatives and off balance sheet financial instruments residential mortgage investment portfolio as previously discussed  we had purchased billion in residential mortgage backed securities as of december   which were primarily financed through repurchase agreements in the amount of billion 
included in these amounts were billion of residential mortgage backed securities that were simultaneously financed with billion in repurchase agreements with the same counterparty from whom the investments were purchased 
because of this purchase and financing relationship  we have recorded these transactions net on our consolidated balance sheet and have recorded a derivative to repurchase these assets based on a technical interpretation of sfas no 
as a result  our obligations to repurchase the mortgage backed securities under the related repurchase agreements qualify as derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these derivatives are considered forward commitments to purchase mortgage backed securities  in the amount of billion  and are recorded at their estimated fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in fair value of these derivatives  which comprised the net interest spread  changes in the fair value of the mortgage backed securities and the credit component of the repurchase agreement and the net change therein  are included in other income 
the fair value  including accrued interest  of these forward commitments to purchase mortgage backed securities was million as of december  in connection with our purchases of mortgage backed securities discussed above  we entered into interest rate swaps  interest rate swaptions and interest rate caps as part of our interest rate risk management program related to these investments 
the objective of these instruments is to offset the changes in fair value of our residential mortgage investments 
these derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives was million as of december  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commercial lending portfolio interest rate risk in our commercial lending portfolio refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates  primarily various short term interest rates  including day libor and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our lending and borrowing on a variable rate basis 
the majority of our commercial loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the prime rate with almost all of our other loans bearing interest at a spread to day libor or at a fixed rate 
the majority of our borrowings bear interest at a spread to day libor or commercial paper rates  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
as of december   approximately of our commercial loan portfolio and of our borrowings bore interest at a fixed rate 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates in certain of our fixed rate loans and in our investments in debt securities 
as discussed above under off balance sheet risk  we attempt to mitigate our exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes in these assets by engaging in hedging activities 
the estimated changes in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our commercial lending portfolio as of december  were as follows estimated decrease increase in rate change net interest income basis points over months in thousands for the purposes of the above analysis  we excluded the impact of principal payments and assumed a advance rate on our variable rate borrowings 
approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our commercial loans had interest rate floors as of december  the loans with interest rate floors as of december  were as follows amount percentage of outstanding total portfolio in thousands loans with contractual interest rates exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor below the interest rate floor loans with no interest rate floor total we also are exposed to changes in market values of certain of our investments in debt and equity securities that are carried at fair value 
as of december   and  our investments in debt and equity securities carried at fair value totaled million  million and million  respectively  and mark to market adjustments on those investments totaled million  million and million  respectively 
residential mortgage investment portfolio we are exposed to changes in interest rates in our residential mortgage investment portfolio and related financing with repurchase agreements based on changes in the level and shape of the yield curve  volatility of interest rates and mortgage prepayments 
a primary risk is related to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates increase  the market value of residential mortgage investments may decline while financing costs could rise  to the extent not offset by hedges 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  the market value of residential mortgage investments may increase while financing costs could fall  also to the extent not offset by hedges 
in addition  changes in the interest rate environment may affect mortgage prepayment rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  mortgage prepayment rates may decrease  thereby extending the duration of our investments 
the majority of our mortgage backed securities have a fixed interest rate for a certain period of time followed by an adjustable rate period in which the adjustments are subject to annual and lifetime caps 
our related repurchase agreements are indexed to a short term interest rate market index such as libor 
we follow an interest rate risk management program designed to limit the exposure of our residential mortgage investment portfolio to shifts in interest rates 
specifically  we seek to match the duration of our assets and liabilities 
to accomplish this objective  we use a variety of hedge instruments such as interest rate swaps and futures that convert the short term financing of our repurchase facility with term financing matched to the expected duration of our residential mortgage investments 
in addition  we use a variety of similar derivatives including options such as swaptions and interest rate caps and floors to hedge other dimensions of interest rate risk 
to the extent necessary and based on established risk criteria  we will adjust the mix of financing and hedges as market conditions and asset performance evolves to maintain a close alignment between our assets and our liabilities 
we have contracted with an external investment advisor  blackrock financial management  inc to provide analytical  risk management and other advisory services in connection with interest rate risk management on this portfolio 
during the year ended december   we entered into derivative instruments to offset the changes in fair value of our residential mortgage investments 
see further discussion regarding these derivatives above in off balance sheet risk 
the estimated changes in fair value based on changes in interest rates applied to our residential mortgage investment portfolio as of december  were as follows estimated decrease rate change increase in basis points fair value in thousands for the purposes of the above analysis  our residential mortgage investment portfolio includes all of our residential mortgage backed securities and related derivatives as of december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
the following describes the areas in which judgments are made by our management in the application of our accounting policies that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
income recognition on loans interest and fee income  including income on impaired loans  is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
for amortizing term loans  which include our balloon loans  interest  original issue discounts and loan fees net of direct costs of origination  including fees due at maturity  are amortized into interest and fee income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan 
for revolving lines of credit and non amortizing term loans  which include our bullet loans  interest  original issue discounts and loan fees net of direct costs of origination  including fees due at maturity  are amortized into interest and fee income using the straight line method over the contractual life of the loan 
loan origination fees are deferred and amortized as adjustments to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan 
we do not take loan fees into income when a loan closes 
in connection with the prepayment of a loan  any remaining unamortized deferred fees for that loan are accelerated and  depending upon the terms of the loan  there may be an additional fee that is charged based upon the prepayment and recognized in the period of the prepayment 
if a loan is days or more past due  or we expect that the borrower will not be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest and fees previously recognized as income but not yet paid are reversed and the recognition of interest and fee income on that loan will stop until factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current 
we will make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
in certain loan arrangements  we receive warrants or other investments from the client as additional origination fees 
the clients granting these interests typically are not publicly traded companies 
we record the investments received at estimated fair value as determined using various valuation models which attempt to estimate the underlying value of the associated entity 
these models are then applied to our ownership share factoring in any discounts for transfer restrictions or other terms which impact the value 
any resulting discount on the loan from recordation of warrant and other equity instruments are accreted into income over the term of the loan 
if our estimates of value of the investments received are not accurate  our income would be misstated 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses reflects the aggregate amount of reserves we have recorded for the loans in our portfolio 
we have assigned reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation were determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  whether the loan is underwritten based on the borrower s assets  real estate or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal credit rating assigned to the loans 
included in the aggregate reserve is a reserve for loan losses for impaired loans based on a comparison of the recorded carrying value of the loan to either the present value of the loan s expected cash flow or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
as defined by sfas no 
 we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all the amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement  including scheduled principal and interest payments 
we generally do not factor in guarantees from or capital call agreements with our borrowers private equity sponsors in determining the overall allowance for loan losses 
however  when performing the sfas no 
analysis on individual troubled loans  we do consider any applicable borrower guarantees when calculating our potential for a specific loss 
we charge off loans against the allocated reserve when full collection of the principal from the sale of collateral or the enforcement of guarantees is remote 
we do not necessarily wait until the final resolution of a loan to charge off the uncollectible balance 
the remaining reserve is in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and represents the aggregate loan loss reserve for losses inherent in the portfolio not yet identified 
we test the policy reserve for reasonableness regularly 
in determining reasonableness  we review trends in the elements analyzed in establishing the reserve factors described above 
in addition  we continue to monitor the market and our competitors to corroborate our reserve levels on similar loan products 
if necessary  a change in the policy reserve amount would be recorded 
if our internal credit ratings  reserve factors or allocated reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan losses 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of basis points applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december  was as follows estimated increase change in reserve factors decrease in the basis points allowance for loan losses in thousands we do not record an additional allowance for loan losses related to our commitments to lend as these amounts are generally subject to approval based on the adequacy of the underlying collateral or other terms and conditions  such as the borrower not being in default 
there also can be no assurance as to the amount  timing or even if such commitments will be funded 
once a commitment to lend is funded  the amount is included in our overall portfolio balance and considered in our determination of the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of investments with respect to investments in publicly traded equity interests  we use quoted market values to value investments 
with respect to investments in privately held equity interests  each investment is valued using an internally developed model 
this model utilizes industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ranging from three to ten times  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
we reduce this value by debt outstanding to arrive at an estimated equity value of the enterprise and then assign a discount to this value to reflect the illiquid nature of the investment  as well as our minority  non control position 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the valuation date 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
a judgmental aspect of accounting for investments involves determining whether an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained 
if it has been determined that an investment recorded at cost has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value  by a charge to earnings  and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
term debt transactions periodically  we transfer pools of loans to special purpose entities for use in term debt transactions 
these on balance sheet term debt securitizations comprise a significant source of our overall funding  with the face amount of the outstanding loans assumed by third parties totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
transfers of loans have not met the requirements of sfas no 
for sales treatment and are  therefore  treated as secured borrowings  with the transferred loans remaining in investments and the related liability recorded in borrowings 
if our judgments as to whether the term debt transactions met the requirements for on balance sheet financing were not appropriate  the accounting would be materially different with gains or losses recorded on the transfer of loans 
mortgage backed securities and related repurchase agreements we own mortgage backed securities that are primarily financed through repurchase agreements with the same counterparty from whom the investments were purchased 
because of this purchase and financing relationship  we record these transactions net on our consolidated balance sheet and record a derivative to repurchase these assets based on a technical interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

we record the cash portion of our investment in mortgage backed securities as a mortgage related receivable on our consolidated balance sheet 
our obligations to repurchase the mortgage backed securities under the related repurchase agreements qualify as derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
these derivatives are considered forward commitments to purchase mortgage backed securities and are recorded at their estimated fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
changes in fair value of this derivative  which comprised the net interest spread  changes in the fair value of the mortgage backed securities and the credit component of the repurchase agreement and the net change therein  are included in other income 
for mortgage backed securities financed by parties other than the seller  we record an asset on the balance sheet and the corresponding financing as a liability on the balance sheet as we are both entitled and obligated to repurchase the securities before their maturity 
we classify these on balance sheet mortgage backed securities as trading securities  which are recorded at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses included in income

concurrently with our sale of these debentures  we entered into two separate call option transactions with an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers  in each case covering the same number of shares as into which the debentures are convertible 
in one transaction  we purchased a call option at a strike price equal to the conversion price of the debentures  adjusted for the effect of dividends paid on our common stock 
this option expires on march  and requires physical settlement
