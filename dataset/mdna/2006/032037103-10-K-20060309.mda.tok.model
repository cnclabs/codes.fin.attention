item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation the corporation currently operates in two business segments the forged and cast rolls segment and the air and liquid processing segment 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel  the world s largest manufacturer of forged hardened steel rolls with its principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana  and davy roll company limited davy roll  a manufacturer of cast rolls which has manufacturing facilities in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
more than two thirds of the annual sales are shipped to destinations outside the segment s own domestic borders 
the air and liquid processing segment consists of aerofin corporation aerofin  buffalo air handling company buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  inc buffalo pumps 
aerofin and buffalo air handling have operations in virginia and buffalo pumps is located in new york 
aerofin produces highly engineered heat exchange coils for a variety of users including electric utility  hvac  power generation  industrial process and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling produces custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
the forged and cast rolls segment is benefiting from an increased level of steel production and a worldwide shortage of forged hardened steel rolls and  to a lesser extent  cast rolls 
the demand arises from the addition of new steel plants and increased steel production  particularly in china  india and other parts of asia  along with a reduction in the number of roll suppliers 
backlog unfilled orders on hand is at an all time high and approximately twice that of a year ago as customers place orders in advance to ensure continuity of supply 
for union electric steel  the shortage of global forged roll capacity and the broad base of its customers are expected to keep the operations at capacity for the next several years 
for davy roll  demand for cast rolls is also expected to remain high 
the outlook for the segment for the foreseeable future is good with the expectation of improved sales and income from operations in each of the businesses within the air and liquid processing segment is small 
their combined sales and earnings were disappointing in the principal reason was buffalo air handling which continued to be impacted by a reduced level of demand until late in the year and incurred an operating loss 
the combination of fewer available construction projects and the industry s excess capacity has lowered profit margins significantly 
the corporation is working hard to reduce costs and improve its competitive position 
buffalo pumps continued to operate at essentially the same level as in while aerofin increased both its sales and earnings  in part due to an increase in nuclear electric utility business 
each of these niche businesses is mature and provides limited growth opportunities 
accordingly  the corporation is focusing on expansion of their distribution networks and seeking additional products which will utilize excess manufacturing capacity  expertise  and sales distribution 
the outlook for the segment in  excluding asbestos litigation expense  is for sales to remain flat with a modest improvement in income from operations 
during  litigation with insurance carriers relating to coverage for personal injury claims alleged to result from asbestos containing products manufactured as many as sixty years ago was resolved with respect to all but one party by a comprehensive coverage arrangement

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the corporation has identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of the corporation s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  litigation  environmental matters  and income taxes 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from the corporation s actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates 
specifically  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid out over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
consideration is also given to historical rates of return and the mix of investments 
for the domestic plan  the rates of return earned on the market related value of plan assets averaged for the five year period of  and for the ten year period of accordingly  the corporation believes the expected long term rate of return of for its domestic plan as of december  to be reasonable 
the foreign plan was formed in connection with the acquisition of the uk operations with plan assets transferred from the seller s plan to a newly created plan in october the rates of return earned on the market value of the plan assets averaged for accordingly  the corporation believes the assumed long term rate of return of as of december  to be reasonable 
the discount rates utilized in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of the plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
the corporation believes the assumed rates of and as of december  for its domestic and u 
k plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
the corporation believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable as outlined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  goodwill is no longer amortized but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in connection with the corporation s strategic planning process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information and represents the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions  pricing and volume 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amount recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for goodwill of  is recoverable and is not impaired as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  the corporation and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products of certain of the corporation s subsidiaries 
to date  substantially all settlement and defense costs have been paid by insurers in respect of the asbestos related claims 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability not covered by insurance is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of probability is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time the financial statements are being prepared 
as of december   the corporation had a remaining accrual balance of which represents the deductible portion of the related insurance policies 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required  and identification of new sites 
the corporation believes the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  its tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of the corporation s operations 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if the corporation determined it would not be able to realize all or part of deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
likewise  if the corporation determined it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  it would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   the corporation has deferred income tax assets approximating  net of an existing valuation allowance of  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on judgment as to the risk of loss should those items be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event the corporation determines that tax related items would no longer be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential deficiencies  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
the corporation believes the potential liability for potential tax deficiencies based on information known to date has been adequately reserved

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation views its primary market risk exposures to relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  the corporation s policy is to hedge a portion of its foreign currency denominated sales and receivables primarily us sales denominated in euros and foreign sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that some exports of the corporation s foreign operation may increase and gross margins improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for the corporation s domestic operations may increase and gross margins improve 
accordingly  a strengthening of either of the entities functional currency the us dollar and the british pound is not expected to have a significant effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of its raw materials and energy  the corporation enters into contracts for a particular commodity copper and purchases a portion of its energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  scrap and alloys would have approximately a  and  impact in and  respectively 
the ability to pass these increases on to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with the corporation having to potentially absorb a significant portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with certain customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect the corporation against such commodity price increases
