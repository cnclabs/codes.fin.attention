table of contents strategic overview bay view capital corporation the company  we  us or our is a financial services company headquartered in san mateo  california  whose primary subsidiary  bay view acceptance corporation bvac  is an automobile finance company engaged in indirect purchases of retail automobile installment contracts originated by manufacturer franchised and independent dealers in connection with the sale of new and used automobiles 
bvac generates revenue through its investment in auto contracts  and the subsequent securitization or sale and servicing of these auto contracts 
liquidation of bay view bank on october   we adopted a plan of dissolution and stockholder liquidity the original plan 
the original plan contemplated that we  under applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law  would dispose of all of our assets  including all of the assets of bay view bank  na bvb  pay all of our debts and liabilities and make reasonable provision for any contingent liabilities  distribute the remaining proceeds from our asset sales to our stockholders  and dissolve 
as a result of the adoption of the original plan  we adopted liquidation basis accounting effective september  during the fourth quarter of  our board amended the original plan to become a plan of partial liquidation the amended plan under which we are completing the liquidation of the assets and the satisfaction of the liabilities of bvb remaining after bvb s september  dissolution  distributed a major portion of the proceeds to our stockholders through a series of cash distributions  and continue to operate bvac 
when we adopted the amended plan  we discontinued our use of liquidation basis accounting and re adopted going concern basis accounting effective october  with bvb s dissolution on september   its remaining assets and liabilities were transferred to us  as bvb s sole stockholder  and we ceased to be a bank holding company and  along with our subsidiaries  were no longer subject to supervision  examination and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb  the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
among the factors considered by our board in deciding to engage in a partial liquidation rather than a complete liquidation were adverse market conditions in the auto finance sector  which caused our board to conclude that the near term sale of bvac to a third party  or distribution of the stock of bvac to our stockholders  as contemplated by the original plan  would not be the best method of maximizing stockholder value  the opportunity to obtain greater corporate and financial flexibility than we would have if we were operating as a dissolving corporation  and a determination that our remaining tax net operating loss carryforwards could be more fully utilized by continuing to operate bvac beyond the third quarter of in accordance with the amended plan  we redeemed million of our cumulative capital securities the capital securities on december   and redeemed the remaining million of these capital securities on june  and  between december  and december   distributed million in cash to our stockholders  or per share after the adjustments to reflect the retroactive effect of the for reverse stock split of our common stock effective june  at december   we had assets of million  liabilities of million and stockholders equity of million 
auto finance bvac is a southern california based auto finance company engaged in the indirect financing of automobile purchases by individuals 
of the auto contracts bvac purchased in  were originated by manufacturer franchised dealerships and the remaining were originated by independent dealerships  were contracts on new vehicles and were contracts on used vehicles 
bvac purchases auto contracts from approximately  automobile dealers in states with limited recourse to the dealer 

table of contents bvac has historically positioned itself in the market as a premium priced lender for well qualified borrowers seeking extended term financing and or higher advance rates than those generally offered by traditional lenders 
this strategy has enabled bvac to establish a loyal dealership network by satisfying a unique niche within the indirect auto finance market that large commercial banks and captive finance companies have not served well 
bvac has leveraged this established reputation with its dealers to broaden its array of auto financing programs available to prime credit quality borrowers 
bvac places a strong emphasis on borrower stability  credit quality and debt serviceability 
with fair  isaac co  or fico  credit scores that averaged in  bvac s borrower base is largely comprised of prime credit quality borrowers 
bvac currently offers financing terms to months and typically finances an amount in excess of a dealer s wholesale value of a vehicle 
during  the term to maturity on auto contracts purchased by bvac averaged months and the loan to value ratio averaged 
the average loan amount financed by bvac in was  since the liquidation of bvb  bvac has operated as an independent finance company  rather than a portfolio lending unit of bvb  purchasing auto contracts primarily for sale or securitization and servicing these auto contracts 
bvac utilizes a revolving warehouse credit facility to fund its purchases of contracts  and periodically sells or securitizes a portion of its auto contracts in order to pay down the facility and maintain available borrowing capacity 
at december   bvac had million outstanding under this credit facility 
bvac retains the servicing obligation on the contracts that it sells or securitizes which provides us with a source of fee income over the life of the contracts 
bvac s headquarters and operations center are located in covina  california 
the operations center manages the underwriting of contracts and supports its dealer relationships 
it also houses bvac s servicing and collections activities involving more than  accounts representing million of managed contracts as of december  in  bvac completed a geographical expansion that was initiated in late  expanding into a total of states from its established presence in states  primarily in the west  midwest and florida
