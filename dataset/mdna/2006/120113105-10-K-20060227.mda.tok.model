item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in item of form k as well as the caption under this item entitled business risks and forward looking statements 
overview homebuilding industry the residential construction services and building products industry experienced another strong year in factors that influence the demand for single family homes such as economic conditions  mortgage interest rates  job formation and consumer confidence were generally favorable 
consequently  the national association of home builders reported an increase of in single family housing starts to a historic high of million units in the forecast for projects a decline of approximately in single family housing starts to million units 
our operations are located in attractive metropolitan areas that have generally outpaced us averages for residential building permit activity 
with construction services and building product offerings in california  las vegas  nevada  phoenix and tucson  arizona  texas  the intermountain and northwest states as well as florida  we believe we are in homebuilding markets supported by positive demographic trends 
we are optimistic about the industry trends that support our business and therefore remain confident in our long term growth 
our strategy we grow our business through acquisitions as well as strategically expanding the breadth of our construction services and building products offered to professional builders and contractors 
in particular  we believe high volume production homebuilders are seeking quality  reliable and cost effective solutions to meet their construction services needs 
in  we completed several acquisitions to expand the trades offered to homebuilders 
our services include framing  concrete  plumbing and other construction services as well as building product distribution and manufactured building components including trusses  millwork and wall panels 
business segments we compete in the homebuilding industry through two business segments bmc construction and bmc west 
bmc construction offers construction services to high volume production homebuilders through operations in key growth markets across the country 
with locations in the western and southern states  bmc west distributes building products and manufactures building components for professional builders and contractors 
these two business segments are subsidiaries of our holding company building materials holding corporation 
as the result of a branding strategy  we changed the name of bmc construction to selectbuild construction 
this change is expected to be formally announced in the first quarter of 
index acquisition history over the past few years  bmc construction acquired businesses providing construction services to high volume production homebuilders 
specifically  these businesses were as follows framing services in san diego  california october concrete services in las vegas  nevada and concrete and plumbing services in southern california september additional interest in our existing business providing foundation and shell construction services in florida august and january interest in concrete services in arizona july interest in plumbing services in phoenix and tucson  arizona april and july stucco services in las vegas  nevada june interest in framing services in chicago  illinois january remaining interest in our existing framing services business in northern california july and july interest in framing services in delaware  maryland and virginia october interest in foundation and shell construction services in florida january in january  we acquired framing businesses in palm springs  california and reno  nevada 
as part of our growth strategy  we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that strengthen and broaden our construction trades as well as presence in attractive markets 
at bmc west  we recently acquired three facilities providing building materials distribution and millwork services in houston  texas february 
we continue to pursue other potential candidates and are also expanding and integrating our building products  manufactured building components  millwork and construction services to become a full service provider to homebuilders 
performance measurements we measure our operating performance and financial condition based on several factors including sales management of working capital income from operations return on investment we evaluate our results of operations including and excluding acquisitions not present in comparable periods 
we believe this approach enhances an understanding of our acquisitions and operating results for the respective reporting periods 

index the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition provides information to assist the reader in understanding our financial statements  changes in key items in those financial statements and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
the discussion of our consolidated financial results is followed by a more detailed review of our business segments 
results of operations compared with the following table sets forth the amounts and percentage relationship to sales of certain costs  expenses and income items millions year ended december sales construction services building products total sales costs and operating expenses cost of goods sold construction services building products total cost of goods sold impairment of assets selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net total costs and operating expenses income from operations net income earnings per diluted share consolidated financial results selected financial results are as follows millions sales construction services building products income from operations a key element of our business strategy for the past several years entails shifting our product and service mix from commodity lumber to value added manufactured building components and construction services 
more recently  in the periods presented in this form k  we have aggressively pursued this shift in emphasis to meet the demands of the market 

index sales increased million to billion due to an increase in construction services and the acquisition of construction services businesses 
sales from acquisitions not present in comparable periods were million or approximately half of the increase 
strong homebuilding activity was prevalent in most of our markets  particularly the southwest region 
building permits and housing starts were also higher in most of our markets relative to the prior year 
income from operations for increased to million from million in the prior year 
improved margins  particularly from demand for our construction services  were a key factor 
margins as a percent of sales for construction services were up while building products also improved compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales and improved by basis points 
these expenses were lower as a percent of sales due to better leveraging of these expenses at our building products operations 
business segments sales and operating income by business segment are as follows millions sales income from operations sales income from operations bmc construction bmc west corporate bmc construction selected financial results are as follows millions sales less acquisitions income from operations less acquisitions sales increased million in acquisitions of construction services businesses not present in the same periods represented of this increase 
home construction activity was strong in las vegas and phoenix as well as most of our other markets 
in addition  housing starts in our markets compared favorably to the prior year 

index income from operations for improved over million compared to the prior year 
margin improvement was a key factor  improving as a percent of sales to compared to in the prior year 
further market acceptance of the value of our construction services  particularly in the las vegas and phoenix markets as well as improved management of contracts  most notably in our florida operations  contributed to the improvement 
acquisitions also contributed approximately or million to the increase in operating income 
selling  general and administrative expenses specific to the business segment were million higher with more than half of the increase due to acquisitions completed during the year 
as a percent of sales  these expenses were compared to in the prior year 
bmc west selected financial results are as follows millions sales less acquisitions income from operations less acquisitions sales increased million in as we experienced strong housing construction across all our regions 
building permit activity for single family homes in our markets was up and compares favorably to the us average of 
in particular  our texas  northwest and intermountain regions reported strong increases in sales compared to a year ago 
our continued focus on a regional business model that provides customers with expanded choices for building products and services from multiple locations also contributed to our sales growth 
income from operations for increased million due to improved margins 
margins as a percent of sales were higher and were compared to in the prior year 
inventory was effectively managed despite fluctuations during the year in commodity wood product prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses specific to the business segment were approximately million higher than the preceding year 
however  these expenses were effectively leveraged as they represented of sales compared to in the prior year 
corporate corporate represents expenses to support the operations of our business segments  bmc construction and bmc west 
these costs include management  information systems  administrative functions for reporting  accounts payable and human resources  professional fees for regulatory compliance as well as incentive compensation 
these costs are not allocated to our business segments 

index selected financial results are as follows millions operating expenses corporate and other expenses were million higher in due to incentive compensation from improved operating performance  professional fees for regulatory compliance and additional personnel to support our expanding business 
these expenses were of sales compared to in compared with the following table sets forth the amounts and percentage relationship to sales of certain costs  expenses and income items millions year ended december sales construction services building products total sales costs and operating expenses cost of goods sold construction services building products total cost of goods sold impairment of assets selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net total costs and operating expenses income from operations net income earnings per diluted share consolidated financial results selected financial results are as follows millions sales construction services building products income from operations sales exceeded billion in  an increase of million over the prior year 
existing operations accounted for or million of the increase and acquisitions of construction services businesses not present in comparable periods represented the remaining million 
construction services continue to increase as a result of our strategy to offer more construction services and value added building products to homebuilders 

index income from operations for increased to million from million in the prior year 
margins as a percent of sales were and approximately the same as the prior year of 
margins for building products were lower  while margins for construction services improved 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales compared to in as a result of improved leveraging of these expenses at our building products operations and maintaining these expenses as a percent of sales at our construction services operations and corporate functions 
business segments sales and operating income by business segment are as follows millions sales income from operations sales income from operations bmc construction bmc west corporate bmc construction selected financial results are as follows millions sales less acquisitions income from operations less acquisitions sales of million in increased over the prior year 
acquisitions of construction services businesses not present in comparable periods accounted for million or of the increase with the remaining million from existing operations 
higher sales were due to robust home construction in las vegas  phoenix and northern california as well as contract increases from rising labor and material costs 
income from operations for was million  up significantly from million in the prior year 
margins as a percent of sales were a driving factor  improving over the prior year 
the improvement was primarily due to the increased value assigned to our construction services in strong housing markets as well as integration efficiencies from recent acquisitions 
although selling  general and administrative expenses specific to the business segment were approximately million higher than the prior year  these expenses were of sales and consistent with the prior year 

index bmc west selected financial results are as follows millions sales less acquisitions income from operations less acquisitions sales of billion in were higher than the prior year 
the increase was due to both growth in sales at existing business units and the impact of higher commodity wood product prices relative to the prior year 
in addition to the benefit of commodity prices  higher sales were due to strong housing demand as building permits in our markets were up compared to the prior year 
income from operations for was million  up from million in the prior year 
despite rising commodity wood product prices  margins remained at approximately as a percent of sales  reflective of our effective management of inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses specific to the business segment were up million or compared to the prior year primarily due to variable compensation expenses 
however  these expenses were leveraged against higher sales as they decreased to of sales compared to the prior year 
corporate corporate represents expenses to support the operations of our business segments  bmc construction and bmc west 
these costs include management  information systems  administrative functions for reporting  accounts payable and human resources  professional fees for regulatory compliance as well as incentive compensation 
these costs are not allocated to our business segments 
selected financial results are as follows millions operating expenses although corporate and other expenses were million higher in due to compensation expenses from improved operating performance  these expenses remained essentially the same at of consolidated sales in both years 
liquidity and capital resources our primary need for capital resources is to fund working capital and acquisitions as well as finance capital expenditures 
capital resources have primarily consisted of cash flows from operations and additional debt 
for the year ended december   million of cash was provided by operations and funded capital expenditures and the majority of our acquisitions as additional debt borrowed was million 

index operations in  cash provided by operating activities was million  up significantly from million in strong home construction activity and improved margins in both our construction services and building products segments resulted in higher net income  providing million of additional operating cash flow over the prior year 
also  working capital requirements were lower than the prior year due to lower commodity wood product prices as well as improved inventory turns and days sales outstanding 
this improved management of working capital resulted in cash used of million compared to million of cash used in the prior year 
cash provided from operating activities was million in up significantly from million in strong home construction activity and our strategy to provide additional construction services resulted in higher net income or million of additional operating cash flow over the prior year 
changes in working capital requirements used million of this cash flow 
capital investment and acquisitions in  cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for the same period a year ago 
cash use included million for the acquisition of three businesses providing framing  concrete and stucco services  a truss manufacturing facility and partial acquisition of four businesses providing concrete  plumbing and framing services 
cash used for investing activities also included million for purchase of property and equipment and million for the purchase of marketable securities 
cash used in investing activities was million higher than the prior year when million was used for the purchase of property and equipment  acquisition of three businesses providing distribution  windows installation and framing and the partial acquisition of a truss manufacturing facility as well as the purchase of marketable securities at our captive insurance subsidiary 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in cash use included million for property and equipment  million for the acquisition of three businesses and partial acquisition of another business as well as million invested in marketable securities at our captive insurance subsidiary 
the cash use was partially offset by proceeds of million from the disposition of property in montana  texas and utah 
financing in  cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million in the prior year 
coupled with strong operating cash flows  funds were borrowed to finance acquisitions and purchase property and equipment whereas funds were borrowed to finance working capital requirements and purchase property and equipment in cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the primary sources of cash were million of net borrowings from the revolver and an increase in book overdrafts and stock options exercised net of tax benefit 
cash from the net borrowings of the revolver  book overdrafts and stock options exercised were used to make payments on the term note  other notes and dividends 

index revolver in june  we entered into an amended million revolver with a group of lenders 
the revolver matures in june the revolver consists of both libor and prime based borrowings 
interest rates are subject to quarterly adjustment based on operating performance and range from libor plus to  or prime plus to 
interest is paid quarterly 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolver 
term notes in june  we also entered into a million term note with a group of lenders 
the term note matures in june with of the initial principal payable for each of the two years commencing september  of the initial principal payable for one year commencing september and the remaining principal balance due june interest rates are subject to quarterly adjustment based on operating performance and range from libor plus to  or prime plus to 
interest is paid quarterly 
as of december   million was outstanding under this term note 
in august  we entered into a million term note with a group of lenders 
the term note matures in june and is payable in quarterly installments for the first six years in amounts equal to of the initial principal amount per year and equal quarterly installments for the remaining principal balance during year seven 
the term note was amended in march to reduce interest rates by and in june to reduce interest rates another 
the interest rate for the term note is libor plus or prime plus 
interest is paid quarterly 
as of december   million was outstanding under this term note 
other other long term debt of million consists of term notes  equipment notes and capital leases for equipment 
interest rates vary and dates of maturity are through march expansion of credit facility  covenants and maturities the credit facility consists of the revolver and term notes 
the credit facility may be increased an aggregate amount of up to million 
the credit facility is collateralized by all tangible and intangible property  except assets of the captive insurance subsidiary 
the credit facility contains covenants and conditions requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants and conditions 
scheduled maturities of long term debt are as follows thousands thereafter as of december  and december   there were million and million  respectively of letters of credit outstanding that guaranteed performance or payment to third parties 
these letters of credit reduce borrowing availability under the revolver 

index hedging activities derivative and hedging activities are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values 
in june  we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a portion of the floating rate borrowings of the million term note to a fixed interest rate through june  thus reducing the impact of increases in interest rates on future interest expense 
approximately of the outstanding floating rate borrowings of the term note as of december  have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as a result  the interest rate on million of the million floating rate borrowings outstanding at december  was fixed at an average rate of 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts  total borrowings are fixed and floating 
the fair value of derivative instruments is based on pricing models using current market rates 
the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a long term asset of million as of december  the effective portion was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  net  a separate component of shareholders equity  and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item  interest expense  in the same period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
a corresponding deferred tax liability of million was also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net for the income tax expense related to the estimated asset of the interest rate swap contracts 
the ineffective portion of the change in the value of the interest rate swap contracts is immediately recognized as a component of interest expense 
hedge ineffectiveness for the period ended december  was not significant 
management may choose not to swap floating rate debt to a fixed rate or may terminate a previously executed swap if the floating rate positions are more beneficial 
equity at the annual meeting of shareholders on may   our shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized common shares to million from million 
these additional shares may be issued for reasons including but not limited to stock splits  financing acquisitions  establishing strategic relationships with corporate partners and providing equity incentives 
on february   our board of directors approved a two for one split of our outstanding common shares 
shareholders of record as of february  will receive a stock dividend of one additional common share for every common share they own 
the additional shares will be distributed on march the information throughout these financial statements is presented as of december  and before the two for one split of our common shares which is effective february  in the third quarter of  we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission to register two million common shares 
we may issue these shares in connection with future business acquisitions  combinations or mergers 
shares have been issued from this registration statement for a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions 
there are approximately million shares remaining and available under this shelf registration 

index based on our historical ability to generate cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under the credit facility and access to debt and equity markets  management believes it will have sufficient capital to meet anticipated needs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our on going business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which might be established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any transactions with unconsolidated entities 
disclosures of contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations as of december  millions payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total fair value long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term commitments interest rate swap contracts notional principal amount of interest rate exchange agreements maturing variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate accelerated repayment of our revolver and term notes may occur if certain financial conditions or warranties and representations are not met 
the credit facility consists of the revolver and term notes 
the credit facility is collateralized by all tangible and intangible property  except assets of the captive insurance subsidiary 
the credit facility contains covenants and conditions requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants and conditions 
we have potential put and call obligations associated with our interests in bbp companies  riggs plumbing  rci construction  a truss  wbc mid atlantic and wbc construction 
under the purchase agreements  we have the right to purchase the remaining portions during certain periods or if certain conditions are met 
likewise  the other owners have the option to require us to purchase the remaining portions during certain dates 
the purchase price for the remaining portions will be based generally on a multiple of historical earnings 

index as part of our revolver  we have million in letters of credit outstanding principally for the deductible portion of automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
these obligations are not required to be recorded on our balance sheet and renew automatically on their various anniversary dates or until released by their respective beneficiaries 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk prices of commodity wood products  which are subject to significant volatility  may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge commodity wood product prices 
changes in interest expense occur when market interest rates change 
changes in the carrying amount of debt could also increase these interest rate risks 
we use interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate risks 
approximately of the outstanding floating rate borrowings of the term notes as of december  have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts  total borrowings are fixed and floating 
based on debt outstanding as of december   a increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest expense annually 
critical accounting estimates preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions include critical accounting estimates which are defined by the securities and exchange commission as those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
these estimates require management s subjective and complex judgments often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain 
we review the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee 
management believes the estimates utilized are reasonable under the circumstances  however actual results could differ from these estimates and may require adjustment in future periods 
our critical accounting estimates are revenue recognition for construction services the percentage of completion method is used to recognize revenue for construction services 
periodic estimates of our progress towards completion are made based on a comparison of labor costs incurred to date with total estimated contract costs for labor 
the percentage of completion method requires the use of various estimates  including among others  the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract completion costs 
contract revenues and contract costs to be recognized are dependent on the accuracy of estimates  including quantities of materials  labor productivity and other cost estimates 
we have a history of making reasonable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract completion costs 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates 
revisions of contract revenues and cost estimates as well as provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are reflected in the period such revisions are determined 

index estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes in contract estimates are reflected in the period such revisions are determined 
these reserves are established by assessing estimated costs to complete  change orders and claims for uncompleted contracts 
at december   the reserve for these estimated losses was million for bmc construction and less than million for bmc west 
these reserves are established by assessing estimated costs to complete  change orders and claims 
assumptions for estimated costs to complete include material prices  labor costs  labor productivity and contract claims 
such estimates are inherently uncertain and therefore it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from these estimates 
we have a history of making reasonable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenue and contract completion costs 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates 
revisions of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are reflected in the period such revisions are determined 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair values of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
an annual assessment for impairment is completed in the fourth quarter and whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is more than the estimated future operating cash flows as measured by fair value techniques 
at december   goodwill was million for bmc construction and million for bmc west 
our fourth quarter assessment concluded with an impairment of million related to goodwill due to changes in a specific market at bmc construction and no impairment for goodwill at bmc west 
the impairment assessment includes determining the estimated fair value of reporting units based on discounting the future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our estimated average cost of funds 
future operating cash flows are derived from our budget information  which includes assumptions of future volumes  pricing of commodity products and labor costs 
prices for commodity products are inherently volatile 
due to the variables associated with prices of commodity products and the effects of changes in circumstances  both the precision and reliability of the estimates of future operating cash flows are subject to uncertainty 
as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
insurance deductible reserves the estimated cost of automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims is determined by actuarial methods 
claims in excess of insurance deductibles are insured with third party insurance carriers 
reserves for claims are recognized based on the estimated costs of these claims as limited by deductibles of the applicable insurance policies 

index at december   the reserve for automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims was million 
the actuarial assessment includes determining the estimated cost of claims 
the reserve for these claims is susceptible to change based on the estimated cost of the claims 
actual loss experience substantially different than the actuarial assumptions may occur 
future reserves are subject to the nature and frequency of claims  medical cost inflation and changes in the insurance deductibles of the applicable insurance policies 
share based compensation our estimate of the fair values of our share based payment transactions are based on the modified black scholes merton model 
in order to meet the fair value measurement objective  we are required to develop estimates regarding expected exercise patterns  share price volatility  forfeiture rates  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
these assumptions are based principally on historical experience 
when circumstances indicate the availability of new or different information that would be useful in estimating these assumptions  revisions will be made and reflected in the periods such revisions are determined 
due to uncertainties inherent in these assumptions  it is possible that actual share based compensation may vary from this estimate 
recent accounting principles in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment  and superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires the measurement and recognition of liabilities incurred to employees in share based payment transactions at fair value 
compensation cost for share based awards and the related tax effects are recognized in the same financial statement line as cash compensation as the requisite service is rendered 
compensation cost is based on the fair value of those awards on the grant date 
this statement is effective for the first quarter of as a result  we expect to recognize compensation cost for share based awards of million in  million in and million in these estimates may change based on additional share based awards as well as actual forfeiture and vesting experience 
additionally  tax benefits for share based compensation will be reported as a financing activity  rather than as an operating cash flow 
business risks and forward looking statements there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that affect our operations and therefore could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results 
additional information regarding business risks and uncertainties is contained in item a of this form k 
these risks and uncertainties may include  however are not limited to 
index demand for single family homes which is influenced by changes in the overall condition of the us economy  including interest rates  job formation  consumer confidence and other important factors  changes to our business model  the integration of acquired businesses may not result in anticipated cost savings and revenue synergies being fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected  our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  availability of and our ability to attract  train and retain qualified individuals  our ability to implement and maintain cost structures that align with revenue growth  changes in the business models of our customers may limit our ability to provide construction services and building products required by our customers  fluctuations in our costs and availability of sourcing channels for commodity wood products  concrete  steel and other building materials  intense competition  weather conditions including natural catastrophic events  exposure to construction defect and product liability claims as well as other legal proceedings  disruptions in our information systems  actual and perceived vulnerabilities as a result of terrorist activities and armed conflict  and numerous other matters of a local and regional scale  including those of a political  economic  business  competitive or regulatory nature 
risks related to our shares include  however are not limited to price for our shares may fluctuate significantly  and anti takeover defenses and certain provisions could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit share price 
certain statements in the annual report to shareholders including those related to expectations about homebuilding activity in our markets  demographic trends supporting homebuilding and anticipated sales and operating income are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of statements that are not historical or current facts  including statements about our expectations  anticipated financial results and future business prospects are forward looking statements 
while these statements represent our current judgment on what the future may hold and we believe these judgments are reasonable  these statements involve risks and uncertainties that are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties cited in the above paragraph 
undue reliance should not be placed on such forward looking statements  as such statements speak only as of the date of the filing of this form k 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements 

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inventory price risk prices of commodity wood products  which are subject to significant volatility  may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge commodity wood product prices 
interest rate risk changes in interest expense occur when market interest rates change 
interest rate swap contracts are currently utilized to hedge interest rate risks 
approximately of the outstanding floating rate borrowings of the million term note as of december  have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap contracts  total borrowings are fixed and floating 
based on debt outstanding as of december   a increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest expense annually
