item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
general we are a leading provider of enterprise software applications and related services to the education industry 
our clients use our software to integrate technology into the education experience and campus life  and to support activities such as a professor assigning digital materials on a class website  a student collaborating with peers or completing research online  an administrator managing a departmental website  or a merchant conducting cash free transactions with students and faculty through pre funded debit accounts 
our clients include colleges  universities  schools and other education providers  as well as textbook publishers and student focused merchants who serve these education providers and their students 
we generate revenues from sales and licensing of products and professional services 
our product revenues consist principally of revenues from annual software licenses  client hosting engagements and the sale of bundled software hardware systems 
we typically sell our licenses and hosting services under annually renewable agreements  and our clients generally pay the annual fees at the beginning of the contract term 
we recognize revenues from these agreements  as well as revenues from bundled software hardware systems  which do not recur  ratably over the contractual term  which is typically months 
billings associated with licenses and hosting services are recorded initially as deferred revenues and then recognized ratably into revenues over the contract term 
we also generate product revenues from the sale and licensing of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with our software 
these revenues are generally recognized upon shipment of the products to our clients 
we derive professional services revenues primarily from training  implementation  installation and other consulting services 
substantially all of our professional services are performed on a time and materials basis 
we recognize these revenues as the services are performed 
we typically license our individual applications either on a stand alone basis or bundled as part of either of two suites  the blackboard academic suite and the blackboard commerce suite 
the blackboard academic suite includes the blackboard learning system  the blackboard community system and the blackboard content system 
the blackboard commerce suite includes the blackboard transaction system  the blackboard community system and blackboard one 
we generally price our software licenses on the basis of full time equivalent students or users 
accordingly  annual license fees are generally greater for larger institutions 
our operating expenses consist of cost of product revenues  cost of professional services revenues  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and stock based compensation expenses 
major components of our cost of product revenues include license and other fees that we owe to third parties upon licensing software  and the cost of hardware that we bundle with our software 
we initially defer these costs and recognize them into expense over the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization of internally developed technology available for sale  employee compensation and benefits for personnel supporting our hosting  support and production functions  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities  depreciation expense and cost of external professional services used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with software are also expensed when incurred  normally upon delivery to our client 
cost of product revenues excludes the amortization of acquired technology recognized from acquisitions  which is included in amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 

table of contents cost of professional services revenues primarily includes the costs of compensation and benefits for employees and external consultants who are involved in the performance of professional services engagements for our clients  as well as travel and related costs  facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include the costs of compensation and benefits for employees who are associated with the creation and testing of the products we offer  as well as the costs of external professional services  travel and related costs attributable to the creation and testing of our products  related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses include the costs of compensation  including bonuses and commissions  and benefits for employees who are associated with the generation of revenues  as well as marketing expenses  costs of external marketing related professional services  investor relations  facility rent  utilities  communications  travel attributable to those sales and marketing employees in the generation of revenues and bad debt expense 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of compensation and benefits for employees in the human resources  legal  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  executive management and other administrative functions that are not directly associated with the generation of revenues or the creation and testing of products 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include the costs of external professional services and insurance  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of costs associated with products  acquired technology  customer lists  non compete agreements and other identifiable intangible assets 
these intangible assets were recorded at the time of our acquisitions and relate to contractual agreements  technology and products that we continue to utilize in our business 
stock based compensation expenses relate to historic stock option grants and have arisen primarily as a result of options granted below fair market value  modifications made to outstanding options and options granted to non employees 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
during the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  fixed assets  long lived assets  including goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from two sources product sales and professional services sales 
product revenues include software license  hardware  premium support and maintenance  and hosting revenues 
professional services revenues include training and consulting services 
we recognize software license and maintenance revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our software does 
table of contents not require significant modification and customization services 
where services are not essential to the functionality of the software  we begin to recognize software licensing revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for our support and maintenance separate from our software 
accordingly  when licenses are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance  we recognize the license revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
we sell hardware in two types of transactions sales of hardware in conjunction with our software licenses  which we refer to as bundled hardware software systems  and sales of hardware without software  which generally involve the resale of third party hardware 
after any necessary installation services are performed  hardware revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we have not determined vsoe of the fair value for the separate components of bundled hardware software systems 
accordingly  when a bundled hardware software system is sold  all revenue is recognized over the term of the maintenance service period 
hardware sales without software are recognized upon delivery of the hardware to our client 
hosting revenues are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   application of aicpa sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
we recognize hosting fees and set up fees ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
we recognize professional services revenues  which are generally contracted on a time and materials basis and consist of training  implementation and installation services  as the services are provided 
we do not offer specified upgrades or incrementally significant discounts 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the product is shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met and the revenue can be recognized 
deferred revenues represent the excess of amounts invoiced over amounts recognized as revenues 
we provide non specified upgrades of our product only on a when and if available basis 
short term investments all investments with original maturities of greater than days are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we determine the appropriate classification at the time of our initial purchase of the investment and we reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity under the effective interest method 
such amortization is recorded as interest income 
interest on held to maturity securities is recorded as interest income 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses  if any  reported in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use an internal collection effort  which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate  in our collection efforts 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our clients deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made 
deferred income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we also recognize deferred tax assets for certain tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
as of december   our total net deferred tax assets were million 
the realization of deferred tax assets 
table of contents is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to certain factors such as the application of complex tax laws  enacted changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a change to our valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
during the three months ended december   we reduced our deferred tax valuation allowance by approximately million  having determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
this reduction resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit totaling million 
of the total income tax benefit recognized  approximately million related to a federal deferred tax benefit with the remainder representing a state deferred tax benefit 
as of december   our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million  which related primarily to certain international net operating loss carryforwards whose realization is uncertain 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in material amounts of additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
although we will continue to have significant net operating loss carryforwards which are expected to mitigate some of our cash tax expenditures over the next several years  we will begin recording  in  a provision for income taxes  which more closely approximates our statutory tax rate adjusted for certain permanent items 
long lived assets 
we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate these assets by examining estimated future cash flows to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
we evaluate these cash flows by using weighted probability techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we test our goodwill for impairment annually on october  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  by comparing its fair value to its carrying value 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business  and a variety of other circumstances 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
although we believe goodwill is appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as modified by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
several companies recently elected to change their accounting policies and record the fair value of options as an expense 
we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee stock option exercise price or restricted stock purchase price equals or exceeds the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
because no market for our common stock existed prior to our initial public offering in june  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including our operating performance  anticipated future operating results  the terms of redeemable convertible preferred stock issued by us  including the liquidation value and other preferences of our preferred stockholders  as well as the valuations of other companies 

table of contents on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  known as sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative upon adopting sfas r 
we adopted sfas r on january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we will implement sfas r in the first quarter of and intend to use the modified prospective method 
we expect the adoption to result in the recognition of stock based compensation expense of approximately million for stock options granted prior to january  plus the expense related to stock options granted during the expense for stock options granted during cannot be determined at this time due to the uncertainty of our stock price  the related black scholes fair value and the timing of future grants 
if we had estimated the fair value of the options on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model and then amortized this estimated fair value over the vesting period of the options  our net loss income attributable to common stockholders would have changed  as shown in the table below year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts pro forma net loss income attributable to common stockholders as reported add stock based compensation included in reported net loss income attributable to common stockholders deduct stock based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards pro forma net loss income attributable to common stockholders net loss income attributable to common stockholders per common share basic as reported diluted as reported basic pro forma diluted pro forma acquisitions on january   we acquired the assets and liabilities of sa cash  a division of student advantage  inc  for million in cash and assumed liabilities of  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated 
table of contents statements of operations since the effective date of the acquisition 
we performed an analysis of the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired in the transaction 
the value attributed to the identifiable intangible assets acquired included million in customer lists 
the customer lists are included in intangible assets and are being amortized over five years 
on october   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with webct and one of our wholly owned subsidiaries which contemplates that we will acquire webct for a purchase price of million in cash  less specified expenses and other adjustments set forth in the agreement through the merger of our subsidiary with webct 
on february   we announced that we had received regulatory clearance from the us department of justice to complete the transaction 
completion of the transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions 
if the merger is consummated we would pay the purchase price using a combination of our available working capital and financing vehicles to be provided pursuant to a million senior secured credit facilities commitment letter with credit suisse 
the commitment letter provides for a million senior secured term loan facility repayable over six years and a million senior secured revolving credit facility due and payable in full at the end of five years 
if the facilities are rated at or above the ratings threshold set forth in the commitment letter  the interest on the facilities will accrue at one of the following rates selected by us a adjusted libor plus or b an alternate base rate plus 
if the facilities are rated below such ratings threshold  the interest on the facilities will accrue and be payable quarterly in arrears at one of the following rates selected by us a adjusted libor plus or b alternate base rate plus 
the alternate base rate is the higher of credit suisse s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 
in addition  we have agreed to flex terms  allowing credit suisse to alter specified provisions of the facilities  including but not limited to the interest rate  if advisable to ensure a successful syndication of the facilities 
under the terms of the commitment letter  the credit facilities would be guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by perfected first priority security interests in  and mortgages on  substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets including the capital stock of each specified subsidiary and each of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the facilities would contain customary negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries with respect to our operations and financial condition 
under the agreement and plan of merger  we and webct each have a termination right if a court or governmental agency has issued a final  non appealable order preventing the consummation of the merger 
in addition  if the agreement and plan of merger is terminated other than by mutual consent or as a result of a breach by webct  we would be required to pay webct million in liquidated damages 
as of december   we have incurred million in costs related to this merger with webct 
these costs are classified as deferred merger costs on our consolidated balance sheet 
when and if the merger is completed  these costs will be included as part of the purchase price allocation 
we will perform an analysis of the fair values of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in the transaction which will be amortized or depreciated as appropriate 
if it is deemed probable the merger will not be completed  we will stop deferring associated merger costs and expense the deferred merger costs in the period it is determined that the merger will not be completed 
important factors considered by management we consider several factors in evaluating both our financial position and our operating performance 
these factors  while primarily focused on relevant financial information  also include other measures such as general market and economic conditions  competitor information and the status of the regulatory environment 
to understand our financial results  it is important to understand our business model and its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting for the majority of our contracts requires us to initially record deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet upon invoicing the sale and then to recognize revenue in subsequent periods ratably over the term of the contract in our consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  to better understand our operations  one must look at both revenues and deferred revenues 

table of contents in evaluating our product revenues  we analyze them in three categories recurring ratable revenues  non recurring ratable revenues and other product revenues 
recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically one year  and that recur each year assuming clients renew their contracts 
these revenues include revenues from the licensing of all of our software products  from our hosting arrangements and from enhanced support and maintenance contracts related to our software products 
non recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year  but that do not contractually recur 
these revenues include the revenues from hardware components of our blackboard transaction system products  with and without our embedded software  and from third party hardware and software sold to our clients in conjunction with our software licenses 
other product revenues include those product revenues that are recognized as earned and are not deferred to future periods 
these revenues include revenues from the sales of blackboard one and blackboard transaction system  as well as the sale of the supplies and from commissions we earn from publishers related to digital course supplement downloads 
each of these individual revenue streams has historically been insignificant 
in the case of both recurring ratable revenues and non recurring ratable revenues  an increase or decrease in the revenues in one period would be attributable primarily to increases or decreases in sales in prior periods 
unlike recurring ratable revenues  which benefit both from new license sales and from the renewal of previously existing licenses  non recurring ratable revenues primarily reflect one time sales that do not contractually renew 
other factors that we consider in making strategic cash flow and operating decisions include cash flows from operations  capital expenditures  total operating expenses and earnings 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated

table of contents the following table sets forth  for each component of revenues  the cost of these revenues expressed as a percentage of the related revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to total revenues of million for the year ended december  product revenues  including both domestic and international  for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to product revenues of million for the year ended december  a detail of our total product revenues by classification is as follows year ended december  in millions recurring ratable revenues non recurring ratable revenues other product revenues total product revenues certain amounts in the prior period s product revenues classifications have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the increase in recurring ratable revenues was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from blackboard learning system licenses  a million increase in hosting revenues  a million increase in revenues from blackboard community system licenses  a million increase in revenues from blackboard content system licenses  a million increase in revenues from blackboard transaction system licenses and a million increase in revenues from blackboard learning system basic edition licenses and a  increase in revenues from enhanced support and maintenance revenues related to our software products 
the increases in each of these categories were attributable to prior period sales to new and existing clients 
as of december   we had a increase in the number of clients as compared to december  further  during  our clients renewed or upgraded approximately of the renewable license dollars eligible to be renewed during  which was consistent with the increase in blackboard learning system license revenues was also attributable to the continued shift from the blackboard learning system basic edition to the enterprise version of the blackboard learning system and the resulting higher average pricing and contractual value of these licenses 
the decrease in non recurring ratable revenues was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from blackboard transaction system hardware products due to a decrease in current and prior period sales 
this decrease was offset in part by a  increase in non recurring hosting revenues  primarily including set up revenues  and a  increase in non recurring publisher fees 
of our total revenues  our international revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  international product revenues were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to international product revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase in international product revenues was driven primarily by an increase in recurring ratable revenues 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from blackboard learning system licenses  a million increase in revenues from blackboard community system licenses  a  
table of contents increase in revenues from blackboard content system licenses  a  increase in revenues from blackboard learning system basic edition licenses and a  increase in hosting revenues 
the increases in each of these categories were attributable to prior period sales to new and existing clients 
the increase in blackboard learning system revenues internationally was primarily attributable to the same factors that contributed to the increase in overall revenues for these products 
the increase in international revenues also reflected our continued investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and international marketing efforts during  which expanded our international presence and enabled us to sell more of our products to new and existing clients in our international markets 
professional services revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to professional services revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase in professional services revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of enterprise licensees  which generally purchase greater volumes of our service offerings 
cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs of product revenues was primarily due to a million increase in expenses for our hosting services due to the increase in number of clients contracting for our hosting services and the expansion of our hosting services facilities during  a million increase in sublicense costs primarily associated with the blackboard content system which was released in march and a  increase in our technical support group expenses 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   due primarily to the decrease in blackboard transaction system hardware sales and shipments during the year ended december  blackboard transaction system hardware products generally have lower gross margins than our software products 
cost of professional services revenues 
our cost of professional services revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of professional services revenues was directly related to the increase in professional services revenues 
cost of professional services revenues as a percentage of professional services revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of professional services revenues was primarily due to a increase in personnel related costs due to an increase in staffing necessary to manage the increase in the number and size of service engagements throughout the year 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of  or  as compared to research and development expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in professional service expenses resulting from our continued efforts to increase the functionality of our products 
this increase was offset in part by a  decrease in recruiting and relocation costs related to hiring efforts during in our research and development department 
sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to sales and marketing expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel related expenses due to an increase in headcount and higher average salaries due to annual salary increases during and a  increase in general marketing activities 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in bad debt expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is associated with the continued improvement in collections on accounts receivables over prior periods and the reinstatement and subsequent collections on accounts receivable that were deemed uncollectible in prior periods 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  from million 
table of contents for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in employee compensation costs related to full year costs for new senior management hires in  increased headcount related to new hires during and higher average salaries across all general and administrative functional departments due to annual salary increases in general and administrative expenses also increased due a million increase in professional service costs associated with costs of being a public company  including increased expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance activities  a  increase in insurance costs due to higher liability coverage costs associated with being a public company and a  increase in costs related to an increase in the office space in our washington  dc headquarters  including rent  utilities  repairs and maintenance expenses 
net interest income 
our net interest income for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million from  for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was attributable primarily to higher cash and short term investment balances for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  resulting from the receipt of proceeds from our ipo in june  cash generated from operations from current and prior periods and the repayment of outstanding debt during current and prior periods 
income taxes 
our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  for the first time in our history  we had generated cumulative earnings from operations for the three year period ended december  as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected operating results in the foreseeable future  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  and accordingly  reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million 
this reduction resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit totaling million 
of the total income tax benefit recognized  approximately million related to a federal deferred tax benefit with the remainder representing a state deferred tax benefit 
we do not have an established history of earnings related to our international net operating loss carryforwards  primarily resulting from our operations in the netherlands  and therefore million in international net operating loss carryforwards continue to be fully reserved through a valuation allowance as of december  although we will continue to have significant net operating loss carryforwards which are expected to mitigate some of our cash tax expenditures over the next several years  we will begin recording  in  a provision for income taxes  which more closely approximates our statutory tax rate adjusted for certain permanent items 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for certain tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount is restricted under section of the internal revenue code 
section of the internal revenue code limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes  as defined by that section  occur 
we have performed an analysis of our section ownership changes and determined that the utilization of some of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
this limitation will defer the utilization of approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards  which will be limited to approximately  per year and will expire  if unused  by the end of we believe we will have sufficient taxable income in those periods to utilize the available net operating loss carryforwards  and therefore we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized

income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  during  the internal revenue service issued an internal revenue bulletin revenue procedure  which allows for greater consistency between gaap and income tax revenue recognition for companies that recognize revenues in a ratable manner 
during  we determined that we would adopt this method for our and subsequent income tax filings 
as a result of this adoption  we will recognize cumulative income tax expense adjustments  which will decrease our federal and state taxable income by approximately million  and we will have a net loss for federal income tax purposes but will be subject to certain international and state taxes in further  we will not be subject to federal alternative minimum taxes as were incurred in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  reflects this adoption 
net income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  quarterly results our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as incurred  in our second and third quarters each year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 

table of contents the following table sets forth selected statements of operations and cash flow data for each of the quarters in the years ended december  and quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands total revenues total operating expenses income from operations net income net cash used in provided by operating activities quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands total revenues total operating expenses income from operations net income net cash used in provided by operating activities for the first time in our history  we had generated cumulative earnings from operations for the three year period ended december  as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected operating results in the foreseeable future  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  and accordingly  reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million 
this reduction resulted in the recognition of an income tax benefit of million for the quarter ended december  liquidity and capital resources we recognize revenues ratably on annually renewable agreements  which results in deferred revenues 
deferred revenues as of december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  from million as of december  deferred revenues increased due to the higher number of renewing licenses during than  offset by the recognition of revenues from prior period sales 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to our net purchases of million in short term investments  which included government agency bonds and auction rate securities  during which yield a higher rate of return than our cash and cash equivalents 
our short term investments were million at december  if our proposed merger with webct is consummated  the purchase price payable by us would be million less specified expenses and other adjustments set forth in the agreement and plan of merger 
we would pay the purchase price using a combination of our available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and the funds to be available pursuant to the senior secured credit facilities commitment letter with credit suisse 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to our million increase in net income during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   which includes a million income tax benefit associated with the reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million and a million larger increase in accrued expenses as of december  as compared to december  primarily due to a million increase in accrued bonuses associated with increase in compensation 
table of contents plans for certain executives during and a lower frequency of annual employee bonus payments  annual bonuses were split between two payments in as compared to only one payment in therefore  accrued bonuses at the end of represent the annual bonus payments to employees to be paid in the first quarter of these increases were offset in part by a million unfavorable impact to cash flows related to an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in invoicing associated with increased sales to new and existing clients during as compared to and a million decrease in amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions due to certain identifiable intangible asset balances being fully amortized in prior periods 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was further decreased by a million decrease in the change in deferred revenues as of december  from december  as compared to the change in deferred revenues as of december  from december  primarily due to the timing of sales and invoicing related to sales of the blackboard transaction system 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million during the year ended december  this increase in cash usage was due to the million investment of our cash and cash equivalents in higher yield short term investments  offset by sales of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million during the year ended december  further  during  we paid million in costs related to our proposed merger with webct 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the million in proceeds from our ipo in june  net of offering costs  offset in part by a million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises during the year ended december  and a million decrease in repayments on outstanding debt during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as of december  we had no outstanding debt 
our working capital line of credit with silicon valley bank expired on april  by its terms 
during the three months ended december   we repaid all amounts outstanding on our equipment lines of credit with silicon valley bank 
we did not deem the working capital line of credit or equipment lines of credit to be necessary and consequently did not renew them upon their expiration 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and future cash provided by operating activities  together with borrowings available under the commitment letter described before related to the webct merger  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including whether and when we complete the webct merger  our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products or services  the timing of enhancements to existing products and services and the timing of capital expenditures 
also  we may make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 

table of contents obligations and commitments as of december   minimum future rental payments under noncancelable operating leases and rental income from subleases are as follows for the years below operating sub lease leases income in thousands and beyond total on january   we entered into an amendment for our washington  dc lease adding additional space and extending our lease term until january  with an option to extend the term to january our annual rental payments will increase by approximately  per year through and by approximately  for  which is not included in the above table 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as incurred  in our second and third quarters each year 
in addition  deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
this pattern may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new market opportunities or new product introductions 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative upon adopting sfas r 
we adopted sfas r on january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas r for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

table of contents we will implement sfas r in the first quarter of and intend to use the modified prospective method 
we expect the adoption to result in the recognition of stock based compensation expense of approximately million for stock options granted prior to january  plus the expense related to stock options granted during the expense for stock options granted during cannot be determined at this time due to the uncertainty of our stock price  the related black scholes fair value and the timing of future grants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates 
our working capital line of credit with silicon valley bank expired on april  by its terms 
during the three months ended december   we repaid all outstanding amounts due on our equipment lines of credit 
in connection with our proposed merger with webct  we have entered into a million senior secured credit facilities commitment letter with credit suisse 
if the facilities are rated at or above the ratings threshold set forth in the commitment letter  the interest on the facilities will accrue at one of the following rates selected by us a adjusted libor plus or b an alternate base rate plus 
if the facilities are rated below such ratings threshold  the interest on the facilities will accrue and be payable quarterly in arrears at one of the following rates selected by us a adjusted libor plus or b alternate base rate plus 
the alternate base rate is the higher of credit suisse s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 
in addition  we have agreed to flex terms  allowing credit suisse to alter certain provisions of the facilities  including but not limited to the interest rate  if advisable to ensure a successful syndication of the facilities 
assuming we draw the entire million under the credit facilities  a one percentage point change in the interest rates ultimately applicable to our credit facilities could result in an increase of up to  in our future interest expense per year  before taking into account repayment of any principal 
interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe that the impact of such fluctuations does not have a material effect on our financial position because of the short term nature of the relevant financial instruments 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates would have reduced our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately million
