the company makes available free of charge through its internet website its annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec 
for information concerning the amount of revenues  net revenues  operating income  identifiable assets  capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
beginning in  the company s primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services 
in the mid s  the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight  ocean freight and distribution services 
today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers  both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location 
as opportunities for profitable growth arise  the company plans to create new offices 
while the company has historically expanded through organic growth  the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of  or establishing joint ventures with  existing agents or others within the industry 
airfreight services airfreight services accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s   and consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses net revenues  respectively 
when performing airfreight services  the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment 
when acting as a freight consolidator  the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines 
when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation  the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment 
whether acting as an agent or consolidator  the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing  familiarity with local business practices  knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures  the ability to arrange for ancillary services  and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demand 
in its airfreight forwarding operations  the company procures shipments from its customers  determines the routing  consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point  and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point 
at the distribution point  the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations 
the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately  to  pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers 
because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation  air shipments are generally characterized by a high value to weight ratio  the need for rapid delivery  or both 
the company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets 
shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within forty eight hours after such delivery 
during peak shipment periods  cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur 
when these conditions exist  the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demand 
the company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in cost effective combinations 
typically  as the weight or volume of a shipment increases  the cost per pound kilo or cubic inch centimeter charged by the company decreases 
the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases 
as a result  by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment  the company is able to obtain a lower rate per pound kilo or cubic inch centimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment  while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipment 
the company s net airfreight forwarding revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers  commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services 
such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation  packing  crating and insurance services  negotiation of letters of credit  and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws 
when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment  its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 
the company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so 
management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks  including large capital outlays  increased fixed operating expenses  problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines 
because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments  changes in carrier policies and practices such as pricing  payment terms  scheduling  and frequency of service may affect its business 
the company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments 
breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipments 
customs brokerage and other services customs brokerage and other services accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s   and consolidated net revenues  respectively 
as a customs broker  the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation  calculating and providing for payment of duties on behalf of the importer  arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies  and arranging for delivery 
the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and product distribution  time definite transportation and inventory management 
none of these other services are currently individually significant to the company s net revenues 
the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder 
however  substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder 
conversely  shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 
the company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states  canada and or mexico 
the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service 
during the company established a subsidiary  expeditors tradewin  llc  to respond to customer driven requests for high end customs consulting services 
the demand for these services was stimulated by the changes made by customs and border protection of the department of homeland security in response to the customs modernization act 
fees for these non transactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed procedures 
ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight services accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s   and consolidated net revenues  respectively 
the company s revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide  such as preparing documentation  procuring insurance  arranging for packing and crating services  and providing consultation 
the company operates expeditors international ocean eio  a non vessel operating common carrier nvocc specializing in ocean freight consolidation from asia to the united states 
eio also provides service  on a smaller scale  to and from any location where the company has an office or agent 
as an nvocc  eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate 
eio solicits less than container load lcl freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines 
eio also handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers 
the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargo 
expeditors cargo management systems ecms supplies a sophisticated ocean consolidation service 
the company owns and maintains software that allows it to sell ecms to large volume customers that have signed their own service contracts with the ocean carriers 
as an ocean consolidator  ecms may obtain lcl freight from several vendors and consolidate this cargo into full containers 
the company s revenues as an ocean consolidator are derived from handling lcl cargo at origin and from the fees paid by customers for access to data captured during the consolidation process 
marketing and customers the company provides flexible service and seeks to understand the needs of the customers from points of origin to ultimate destinations 
although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required  the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process 
therefore  the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliers 
the company s marketing efforts are focused primarily on the traffic  shipping and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers 
the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing  sales coordination  and implementation in the area in which he or she is located 
all employees are responsible for customer service and relations 
the company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics 
marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing the company s services directly to local shippers and traffic managers who may select or influence the selection of the logistics vendor and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service 
the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers  its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities  and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 
the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination 
shipments of computer components  other electronic equipment  housewares  sporting goods  machine parts  and toys  comprise a significant percentage of the company s business 
typical import customers include computer retailers and distributors of consumer electronics  department store chains  clothing and shoe wholesalers  manufacturers and catalogue stores 
historically  no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the company s revenues 
competition the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry  but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited 
depending on the location of the shipper and the importer  the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities 
while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into larger firms striving for immediate multinational and multi service networks  the regional and local competitors maintain a strong market presence 
historically  the primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry have been price and quality of service  including reliability  responsiveness  expertise  convenience  and scope of operations 
the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry 
recently  larger customers have exhibited a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management 
this trend has made computerized customer service capabilities a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers 
these computerized customer service capabilities include customized electronic data interchange  edi  and on line freight tracing and tracking applications 
the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers systems and the company s systems 
freight tracing and tracking applications allow customers to know the location  transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transit 
management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company 
accordingly  the company has devoted a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands 
management believes that the company s existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competes 
unlike many of its competitors  who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition  the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software  running on a common hardware platform  in all of its full service locations 
small and middle tier competitors  in general  do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems 
as a result  there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry 
management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term 
historically  growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill 
as a result  the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions 
the company s ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential  if not the most important  element of its ability to compete in the industry 
to this end  the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of branch revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel 
the company believes that these incentive compensation programs  combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts  provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisition 
currency and other risk factors the nature of the company s worldwide operations necessitate the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar 
this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference 
many of the countries where the company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure 
the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among these offices or agents 
in addition  the company s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines  steamship lines and governmental agencies 
the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be good 
however  changes in space allotments available from carriers  governmental deregulation efforts  modernization of the regulations governing customs clearance  and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
seasonality historically  the company s operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern has been the result of  or influenced by  numerous factors including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company s international network and service offerings 
the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and  as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules 
therefore  the timing of the company s revenues are  to a large degree  impacted by factors out of the company s control  such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays 
additionally  many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter  and therefore  the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter 
to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts  any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s stock 
environmental in the united states  the company is subject to federal  state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment 
similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates 
although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws  governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues  and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business 
the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years 
employees at january   the company employed approximately  people   in the united states and in the balance of north america  in south america   in europe   in asia australasia  in the near middle east and in africa 
approximately  of the company s employees are engaged principally in sales and marketing and customer service   in operations and  in finance and administration 
the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 
in order to retain the services of highly qualified  experienced  and motivated employees  the company places considerable emphasis on its incentive compensation programs and stock option plans

wall was elected vice president ecms in january and senior vice president ocean services in september regulation with respect to the company s activities in the air transportation industry in the united states  it is subject to regulation by the transportation safety administration of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier 
the company s overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation 
the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices  has made application for a license  as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association iata 
iata is a voluntary association of airlines which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members 
the majority of the company s airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata members 
the company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection cbp of the department of homeland security in each us customs district in which it does business 
all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp 
in other jurisdictions in which the company performs clearance services  the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority 
the company is registered as an ocean transportation intermediary by the federal maritime commission fmc 
the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents  including certain surety bonding requirements 
the fmc also is responsible for the economic regulation of nvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states 
to comply with these economic regulations  vessel operators and nvoccs  such as eio  are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states 
the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 
the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations 
in general  the company conducts its business activities in each country through a majority owned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country 
however  the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the company s ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united states owned subsidiary 
for example  foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities 
when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction  it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation 
this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license 
in cases where the company has unilateral control over the assets and operations of the local entity  notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership of common stock  the company consolidates the accounts of the local entity 
in such cases  consolidation is necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the company because of the existence of the parent subsidiary relationship by means other than record ownership of voting common stock 
cargo liability when acting as an airfreight consolidator  the company assumes a carrier s liability for lost or damaged shipments 
this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value per pound unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge  except if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct or in the absence of an appropriate airway bill 
the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent 
when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper  the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline 
when acting as an ocean freight consolidator  the company assumes a carrier s liability for lost or damaged shipments 
this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge 
the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent 
in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations  the company does not assume cargo liability 
when providing warehouse and distribution services  the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or fifty cents per pound with a maximum of fifty dollars per lot which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track 
upon payment of a surcharge for warehouse and distribution services  the company will assume additional liability 
the company maintains marine cargo insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable 
the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities 
this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont based insurance entity wholly owned by the company 
the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company 
the total risk retained by the company in was approximately million  although actual and estimated losses are expected to be less 
this self retention will increase to million as of february in addition  the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary  expeditors cargo insurance brokers  inc and places stand alone insurance coverage for other customers 
item a risk factors risk factors discussion and potential significance international trade the company primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce 
everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract the company s primary market 
for example  international trade is influenced by currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations  changes in governmental policies  changes in international and domestic customs regulations  wars  acts of terrorism  and other conflicts  natural disasters  changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own  and changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum related products 
third party vendors the company is a non asset based supplier of global logistics services 
as a result  the company depends on a variety of asset based third party vendors 
the quality and profitability of the company s services depend upon effective selection  management and discipline of third party vendors 
predictability of results the company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short term customer requirements 
however  long term customer satisfaction depends upon the company s ability to meet these unpredictable short term customer requirements 
personnel costs  the company s single largest variable expense  are always less flexible in the very near term as the company must staff to meet uncertain demand 
as a result  short term operating results could be disproportionately affected 
foreign operations the majority of the company s revenues and operating income come from operations conducted outside the united states 
to maintain a global service network  the company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations 
key personnel the company is a service business 
the quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the company s employees 
identifying  training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability 
continued loyalty to the company will not be assured by contract 
technology increasingly  the company must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses 
future results depend upon the company s success in the cost effective development and integration of communication and information systems technologies 
growth to date  the company has relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition 
future results will depend upon the company s ability to continue to grow internally or to demonstrate the ability to successfully identify and integrate non dilutive acquisitions 
regulatory environment as a publicly traded corporation  the company is affected by regulations from a number of sources 
the current business environment tends to stress the avoidance of risk through regulation and oversight  the effect of which is likely to be unforeseen costs and potentially unforeseen consequences 
in reaction to the global war on terror  governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations 
the implementation of these regulations  including deadlines and substantive requirements  is driven by political urgencies rather than the industries realistic ability to comply 
failure to timely comply may result in increased operating costs  restrictions on operations and or fines and penalties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary expeditors international of washington  inc is engaged in the business of global logistics management  including international freight forwarding and consolidation  for both air and ocean freight 
the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices  and in many of its international offices 
the company also provides additional services for its customers including value added distribution  purchase order management  vendor consolidation and other logistics solutions 
the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business 
the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamships 
international trade is influenced by many factors  including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad  currency exchange rates  and united states and foreign laws and policies relating to tariffs  trade restrictions  foreign investments and taxation 
periodically  governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions 
the company cannot predict which  if any  of these proposals may be adopted  nor can the company predict the affects adoption of any such proposal will have on the company s business 
doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises 
in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade  the company s business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the nations in which it does business 
the company derives its revenues from three principal sources airfreight  ocean freight  and customs brokerage and other services 
these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statements 
the company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility the americas  asia  europe  africa  near middle east and indian subcontinent emair  and australasia 
each area is divided into sub regions which are composed of several operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility 
the company s business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area 
the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation between operating units 
because of this inter relationship between operating units  it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the company s overall success on a stand alone basis 
the company s operating units share revenue according to arms length industry conventions 
the company s strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability 
individual success likely involves cooperation with other operating units 
as a non asset based carrier  the company does not own transportation assets 
rather  the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct asset based carriers and reselling those services to its customers 
the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate  and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue or yield 
by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power  the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers  while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves 
customs brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination  such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation  calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies  and arranging for delivery 
this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices 
the company s ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines  ocean steamship lines  and governmental agencies 
the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and asset based providers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism 
as each carrier labors to comply with governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures  inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade to some degree 
a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will effectively meet security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles 
the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory 
however  changes in space allotments available from carriers  governmental deregulation efforts  modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage  and or changes in governmental quota restrictions could affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
historically  the company s operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis 
the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company s international network and service offerings 
the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and  as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand  and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just in time production schedules 
therefore  the timing of the company s revenues are  to a large degree  impacted by factors out of the company s control  such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays 
additionally  many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter  and therefore  the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter 
to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts  any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s stock 
as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources  total capital expenditures in are expected to exceed million 
in terms of the opportunities  challenges and risks that management focused on in  the company operates in countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy 
from the inception of the company  management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting  training  and ultimately retaining superior personnel 
the company s greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global culture which demands total dedication  first and foremost  to providing superior customer service  aggressive marketing of all of the company s service offerings  ongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal means  creation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work  personal growth and continuous improvement  individual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required  a qualified and well trained internal candidate is ready to step forward  and continuous identification  design and implementation of system solutions  both technological and otherwise  to meet and exceed the needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effective 
the company has reinforced these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control 
there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success 
the company believes in a real world environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions 
at the same time  the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection  cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a career 
any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a self sustained basis throughout the company  provides a greater threat to the company s continued success than any external force  which would be largely beyond our control 
consequently  management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also building systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events 
the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that  in the aggregate  could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations 
as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global culture of well trained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emerge 
critical accounting estimates a summary of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note in the consolidated financial statements in this k 
management believes that the nature of the company s business is such that there are few  if any  complex measurement issues or challenges in accounting for operations 
while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting  the company s use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areas that in the aggregate are not a major component of the company s statement of earnings accounts receivable valuation  the useful lives of long term assets  the accrual of costs related to ancillary services the company provides  establishment of adequate insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has self insured  and accrual of tax expense on an interim basis 
management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are non aggressive in approach and consistent in application 
management believes that there are limited  if any  alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the company s transactions 
while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates  the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reported 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june   with early adoption encouraged 
in addition  sfas no 
r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amount in the company s pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
the company has adopted sfas no 
r as of january  under sfas no 
r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the company will continue to use the black scholes model for valuing option expense and will amortize the compensation expense using the straight line prorated method 
the company has elected to use the modified retrospective method of transitioning to sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  beginning with the report on form q for the first quarter of  the company will restate all periods presented 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheet  the consolidated results of operations  earnings per share and consolidated statement of cash flows 
results of operations the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company s principal services and the company s expenses for   and  expressed as percentages of net revenues 
management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company 
in thousands amount percent of net revenues amount percent of net revenues amount percent of net revenues net revenues airfreight ocean freight and ocean services customs brokerage and other services net revenues operating expenses salaries and related costs other total operating expenses operating income other income  net earnings before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense net earnings before minority interest minority interest net earnings compared with airfreight net revenues in increased compared with primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes 
global airfreight tonnages in increased compared with the decrease in airfreight yields in was primarily a result of air carrier fuel surcharges which the company typically passes on without a profit element 
the company s north american export airfreight net revenues increased in compared to  primarily the result of increased market share attributable to focused sales activity 
airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased and  respectively  for compared with these increases are the result of market price increases  partially offset by yield declines of less than  and increased tonnage of from asia and from europe  primarily as a result of increased sales success 
ocean freight volumes  measured in terms of forty foot container equivalents feus  increased over while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased during the same period 
the increase in net revenue can be attributed to cyclical market conditions and trade lane imbalances 
the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level  while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level 
the company s north american ocean freight net revenues increased in compared to ocean freight net revenues from asia increased and from europe decreased for compared with the increase in north american and asian ocean freight net revenue are primarily a result of greater market share 
the decrease experienced in europe is primarily due to decreased export volumes which can be attributable to the relative value of european currencies throughout the year 
customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased in as compared with this is a result of the company s reputation for providing high quality service and increased opportunities within the customs brokerage market 
these opportunities arise as customers seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities 
in addition  the company s customs brokerage offerings have benefited from increased emphasis on regulatory compliance 
salaries and related costs increased in compared to as a result of the company s increased hiring of sales  operations  and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and increased compensation levels 
salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues 
the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee 
using this compensation model  changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits 
management believes that the growth in revenues  net revenues and net earnings for are a result of the incentives inherent in the company s compensation program 
this trend may not continue in and future years as a result of the adoption of sfas r  which requires the expensing of the fair value of employee stock options 
management expects salaries and related costs as a percentage of net revenues will be more volatile 
other operating expenses increased in as compared with as rent expense  communications expense  quality and training expenses  and other costs expanded to accommodate the company s growing operations 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in as compared with management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of ongoing cost containment objectives at the branch level 
other income  net  increased in as compared with due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and short term investments during  interest income increased by million for the year ended december  the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions  as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations 
the company s consolidated effective income tax rate in of decreased when compared with the rate in the lower tax rate in is primarily the result of the company adopting a plan under internal revenue code irc  which was added by the american jobs creation act 
in accordance with irc  the company recorded a one time tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of in order to qualify for this credit  the company adopted a plan which requires qualified capital expenditures of approximately million over the next two to three years 
compared with airfreight net revenues in increased compared with primarily because of an increase in airfreight volumes 
global airfreight tonnages in increased compared with the decrease in airfreight yields in was primarily a result of air carriers increasing their rates such that the company was unable to increase its corresponding rates to customers in a timely and effective manner 
as with the second half of  the company elected to absorb these short term decreases in the interest of maintaining long term customer relationships 
the company s north american export airfreight net revenues increased in compared to the increase is partly a recovery of the prior year decrease and partly the result of increased exports from the united states due to the weakening of the us dollar 
airfreight net revenues from asia and from europe increased and  respectively  for compared with these increases are the result of market price increases  partially offset by yield declines of less than  and increased tonnage of from asia and from europe  primarily as a result of increased sales success 
ocean freight volumes  measured in terms of forty foot container equivalents feus  increased over while ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased only during the same period 
the difference in these two growth rates is a result of a basis point reduction in ocean freight yields 
the reduction in a yield is a function of two major factors revenue from ecms in increased only over because of rate pressures on vendor consolidation fees 
a series of rate increases put forward by direct ocean freight carriers throughout due to market conditions primarily related to capacity  these rate increases  because of magnitude and frequency  could not be passed on to customers in a timely manner 
the company continued its focus of offering competitive rates to customers at the retail level  while leveraging freight volumes to obtain favorable rates from carriers at the wholesale level 
the company s north american ocean freight net revenues increased in compared to ocean freight net revenues from asia and from europe increased and  respectively  for compared with customs brokerage and other services net revenues increased in as compared with this is a result of the company s growing reputation for providing high quality service and consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program 
in addition  increased emphasis on regulatory compliance has benefited the company s customs brokerage offerings 
salaries and related costs increased in compared to as a result of the company s increased hiring of sales  operations  and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and increased compensation levels 
salaries and related costs remained constant as a percentage of net revenues 
the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee 
using this compensation model  changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits 
management believes that the growth in revenues  net revenues and net earnings for are a result of the incentives inherent in the company s compensation program 
other operating expenses increased in as compared with as rent expense  communications expense  quality and training expenses  and other costs expanded to accommodate the company s growing operations 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in as compared with management believes that this was significant as it reflects the successful achievement of ongoing cost containment objectives at the branch level 
the ability to sustain these savings into future periods is contingent upon branch level management s ability to adhere to these objectives 
other income  net  decreased in as compared with due to higher interest rates on higher average cash balances and short term investments during  interest income increased by million for the year ended december  rental income  net of applicable depreciation  of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  is included in other income 
the rental income is derived from two of the company s properties  one located near heathrow airport in london  england and an office and warehouse facility near the san francisco  california international airport 
as a result of the scheduled remodeling of the san francisco  california office and warehouse facility  rental income from that property ceased at the end of the first quarter of the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions  as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations 
the company s consolidated effective income tax rate in of decreased when compared with the rate in the lower tax rate in is the result of the decreased state tax expense caused by an increase in the taxable income sourced outside the united states and certain accounting adjustments made in currency and other risk factors international air ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry  however  the company s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group 
while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks  regional and local broker forwarders remain a competitive force 
historically  the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service  including reliability  responsiveness  expertise  convenience  and scope of operations 
the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry 
customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management 
the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and consistent global coverage 
accordingly  sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 
developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers 
smaller and middle tier competitors  in general  do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 
as a result  there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry 
management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term 
the nature of the company s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar 
this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference 
some of the countries where the company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure 
the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 
the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company s ability to move money freely around the world or the short term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time sensitive way to avoid short term exchange losses 
any such hedging activity during  and was insignificant 
net foreign currency gains realized in  and were  and  respectively 
the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december  and the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight  ocean freight and customs brokerage and other services 
historically  this annual filing has gone on to state that in light of the customer driven trend to provide customer rates on a door to door basis  management foresees the potential  in the medium to long term  for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 
we now believe we were wrong about this 
sources of growth during  the company opened full service offices and satellite offices  as follows asia europe latin america north america middle east dongguan  prc warsaw  poland porto alegre  brazil monterrey  mexico tiruppur  india nanjing  prc malmoe  sweden lima  peru macau  prc turin  italy laem chabang  thailand aberdeen  scotland ningbo  china zurich  switzerland surabaya  indonesia johor bahru  malaysia da nang  vietnam ningbo  surabaya and johor bahru converted from satellites to full service offices in acquisitions historically  growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill  the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business 
as a result  the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions  where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the goodwill recorded in the transaction 
internal growth management believes that a comparison of same store growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company s internally generated growth 
this same store analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company s operating results for at least one full year 
the table below presents same store comparisons on a year over year basis for the years ended december   and same store comparisons for the years ended december  net revenues operating income liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared with million for this million increase is principally due to increased net earnings and deferred tax expense on unremitted foreign earnings 
the increased accounts receivable is offset by increased accounts payable  accrued expenses and taxes payable 
increased accounts receivable is primarily due to higher billings in november and december  compared to the same periods in increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses are a result of the company s attempts to manage cash flows by matching the timing of cash outflows for payments to vendors with cash inflows from collections of customer billings 
the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality 
historically  the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings 
this results in positive cash flow 
the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections 
this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 
due to the company s management of accounts payable and accrued expenses as described in the preceding paragraph  cash flow from operating activities remained positive 
as a customs broker  the company makes significant business day cash advances for certain of its customers obligations such as the payment of duties to the customs and border protection of the department of homeland security 
these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of credit worthy customers 
cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense 
the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable to the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities 
as a result of these pass through billings  the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared with million during the same period of the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures 
as a non asset based provider of integrated logistics services  the company does not own any physical means of transportation ie  airplanes  ships  trucks  ie however  the company does have need  on occasion  to purchase buildings to house staff and to facilitate the staging of customers freight 
the company routinely invests in technology  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
for the year ended december   the company made capital expenditures of million as compared with million for the same period in capital expenditures in included million for acquisitions of real estate and office warehouse facilities in houston  texas and seattle  washington 
in addition  the company had real estate development expenditures of million related to projects in san francisco and los angeles  california  seattle  washington and houston  texas 
other capital expenditures in and related primarily to investments in technology  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company currently expects to spend approximately million for normal capital expenditures in in addition to property and equipment  normal capital expenditures include leasehold improvements  warehouse equipment  computer hardware and furniture and fixtures 
total capital expenditures in are currently estimated to be million 
this includes normal capital expenditures as noted above  plus additional real estate acquisitions and development required to carry out the company s plan adopted under irc the company expects to finance capital expenditures in with cash 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared with million for the same period in the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company s stock on the open market 
in  the company established a policy of repurchasing stock to prevent growth in issued and outstanding shares as a result of stock option exercises 
the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  compared with the same period in is primarily the result of this new policy 
during and the net use of cash in financing activities included the payment of dividends of 
per share and 
per share  respectively 
at december   working capital was million  including cash and short term investments of million 
the company had no long term debt at december  the company maintains international and domestic unsecured bank lines of credit 
at december   the united states facility totaled million and the international bank lines of credit  excluding the uk bank facility  totaled million 
in addition  the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for million which is available for short term borrowings and issuances of standby letters of credit 
at december   the company had no amounts outstanding on these lines of credit  but was contingently liable for million from standby letters of credit and guarantees related to these lines of credit and other obligations 
the guarantees relate to obligations of the company s foreign subsidiaries for credit extended in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers  primarily airlines  and for duty and tax deferrals available from governmental entities responsible for customs and value added tax vat taxation 
the total underlying amounts due and payable for transportation and governmental excises are properly recorded as obligations in the books of the respective foreign subsidiaries  and there would be no need to record additional expense in the unlikely event the parent company were to be required to perform 
at december   the company s contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations construction obligations total contractual cash obligations the company enters into short term agreements with asset based providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis 
the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions 
the company only enters into agreements that management believes the company can fulfill with relative ease 
historically  the company has not paid for guaranteed space that it has not used 
management believes  in line with historical experience  committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december   will be fulfilled during in the company s ordinary course of business 
amount of commitment expiration in thousands total amounts committed per period less than year years years after years other commitments international lines of credit standby letters of credit total commitments the company has a non discretionary stock repurchase plan to repurchase shares from the proceeds of stock option exercises 
as of december   the company had repurchased and retired  shares of common stock at an average price of per share over the period from through during   shares were repurchased at an average price of per share 
the company has a discretionary stock repurchase plan under which management is allowed to repurchase such shares as may be necessary to reduce the issued and outstanding stock to  shares of common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased and retired  shares of common stock at an average price of per share over the period from through during   shares were repurchased at an average price of 
these discretionary repurchases were made to keep the number of issued and outstanding shares from growing as a result of stock option exercises 
management believes that the company s current cash position  bank financing arrangements  and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future  including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligations 
in some cases  the company s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls 
at december   cash and cash equivalent balances of million were held by the company s non united states subsidiaries  of which million was held in banks in the united states 
impact of inflation to date  the company s business has not been adversely affected by inflation 
direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term period 
due to the high degree of competition in the market place  these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the company s margins 
as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate sensitive indebtedness  the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of securities and exchange commission sec regulation s k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business 
these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates 
the potential impact of the company s exposure to these risks is presented below foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies 
the company s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred 
in the ordinary course of business  the company creates numerous intercompany transactions 
this brings a market risk to the company s earnings 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar  the company s functional currency  relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business 
all other things being equal  an average weakening of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately million 
an average strengthening of the us dollar  for the same period  would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately million 
this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation 
for example  a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and depress imports into the united states over some relevant period of time  but the exact affect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptions

there were no short term borrowings at december  a hypothetical change in the interest rate of would not have a significant impact on the company s earnings 
in management s opinion  there has been no material change in the company s market risk exposure between and
