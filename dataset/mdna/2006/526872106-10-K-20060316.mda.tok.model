it includes the following sections overview business segment results vs 
business segment results vs 
liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates recently issued accounting pronouncements overview lesco is a leading provider of lawn care  landscape  golf course and pest control products to the billion professional green and pest control industries 
the professional users of our products include lawn care and landscape firms  pest management professionals and the employees of a variety of commercial  governmental  institutional and industrial establishments  including golf courses  sod farms  airports  cemeteries  professional sports organizations  universities  schools  commercial properties and other organizations that use in house employees to maintain lawns  grounds and gardens 
we track our customers through two customer sectors lawn care and golf 
gross sales for these sectors were as follows for each of the past three years dollars in millions lawn care golf although many of our customers purchase products from lesco through both of our operating segments stores and direct  the separation of our customers into these two sectors is important as distribution to the sectors is vastly different and their growth prospects vary significantly 
our lawn care sector includes all non golf related customers and is dominated by lawn care and landscape firms 
historically  industry wide distribution of products into this sector has been fragmented and inefficient 
we believe that our model of service centers and direct selling efforts provides efficiency to the sector s distribution channels through easily accessible  strategically positioned real estate  where we provide agronomic expertise through our service centers and direct sales associates with products specifically targeted to the lawn care sector 
we generated million of sales through the service centers opened in the last three years 
we estimate the market for our consumable lawn care products at billion  of which billion is in the professional sector and billion is in the consumer sector 
independent research indicates that organic growth in the industry is expected to exceed annually for the next several years due to the aging of the baby boomers and their increasing desire to contract lawn care professionals due to time or ability constraints coupled with their desire to have healthy and aesthetically pleasing lawns  and the higher number of dual income families 
the golf industry is a smaller market estimated at billion and is not expected to grow significantly during the near future  nor do we believe our opportunities are as great in this sector as they are in the lawn care sector 
over the past few years  the industry has experienced a decline in annual rounds of golf played  which has decreased the budgets of golf course superintendents 
additionally  the expansion of golf course acreage  in terms of new course construction  has slowed in recent years 
the ability to capture incremental market share is limited as distribution of products to the golf industry is dominated by a few national and regional distributors 
we currently operate stores on wheels that service the golf industry 
during  we expanded our fleet of vehicles by units from our base of at the end of the vast majority of the fleet is comprised of smaller  more cost effective vehicles compared to the larger tractor trailer units that the company historically operated 
we believe that these smaller units will allow us to expand the concentration of our customer base beyond the golf customer 
our historical financial performance and returns on invested capital through were unacceptable 
we operated three business lines that consumed capital selling product  manufacturing and distribution operations supply chain and credit financing 
based upon the opportunities that were available in our customer sectors and opportunities for improvement in our financial performance  we embarked in on a strategy to reposition lesco in order to capitalize more effectively on our opportunities 
in  the company reached a significant inflection point as it completed its strategic and financial restructuring  culminating with the sale of lesco s supply chain assets 
the following is a summary of the changes we have made to our business over the past two years  along with any financial impacts from these changes sale of supply chain assets the fourth quarter of marked the culmination of the company s strategic effort to sell its manufacturing and distribution assets 
the assets were sold to tcs along with the related working capital for million 
ultimately  the company expects to harvest million in cash after settling all requirements associated with the transaction including the accounts payable due to vendors for the inventory sold to tcs 
the supply chain assets sold included all four of lesco s blending facilities and the majority of the company s warehouse and distribution centers 
lesco recorded a charge of million related to the transaction for the loss on sale of assets  lease terminations and service fees including banking  legal and insurance costs 
there were four distribution facilities that were not purchased by tcs and subsequently were closed by lesco as of december  the company recorded million in closing costs and asset impairment expense for these facilities 
concurrently with the execution of the sale agreement  the company entered into a long term supply contract with tcs that includes  among other terms  negotiated pricing  access to blending capacity  service level requirements and built in cost reduction incentives 
in previous years  leading up to the sale to tcs  the company began rationalizing its blending capacity and ceased operations at  and decided to sell  two manufacturing facilities a methylene urea facility in disputanta  virginia and a manufacturing facility in stockton  california and certain other properties 
in conjunction with the shutdown of those operations  we recorded a reserve to provide for the remaining obligations associated with each site 
at december   million remained in the reserve pertaining to these properties  primarily representing future lease and real estate tax payments 
for the assets shuttered in  there is million remaining in the reserve at december  all future costs incurred to prepare the various sites for sale  including environmental testing and environmental remediation costs  will be capitalized up to the realizable market value of each respective property 
stores expansion and segment operating model we expanded the number of service centers and stores on wheels locations and modified our financial reporting to reflect the changes in our operating model after the sale of the supply chain assets to tcs 
a 
new service center program lesco did not open any new service centers from until our analysis of service center four wall profit and loss statements p ls and four wall return on invested capital roic indicated that with a total capital and working capital investment of  to  an average service center at maturity generates approximately million of sales and a roic of approximately 
as a result  we performed a statistical analysis utilizing historical service center operating performance  published industry data and government data relative to the us metropolitan statistical areas 
this analysis indicated ample opportunity to expand the number of service centers in the continental united states by over locations 
we began a service center opening program resulting in new service centers in  new service centers in  and new service centers in  with an expectation to open up to additional service centers in b 
stores on wheels expansion during the first half of  we expanded our fleet of stores on wheels vehicles by to units from a fleet of units at the end of the rapid expansion of this sales channel created significant challenges  including employee turnover and asset deployment  however  we anticipate improved profitability levels in as efficiency gains are realized due to the condensed sales territories and downsized vehicle requirements box truck versus tractor trailer 
the cost effective stores on wheels will service not only golf course customers  but will visit all locations with stationary turf superintendent functions including schools  universities  cemeteries  parks and municipalities 
we currently anticipate placing three incremental units into service in furthermore  in we expanded our field management organization to enhance the required infrastructure to support our future store growth  which will come predominantly from adding new service centers 
the incremental million incurred in for the expansion of our stores on wheels fleet and field management team is not expected to be replicated in c 
segment reporting concurrently with the sale of its supply chain assets  the company revised its segment reporting and now reports on two segments stores and direct 
the stores segment includes operating results of the company s service centers  stores on wheels vehicles and field management costs 
the direct segment includes the operating results of all non store transactions 
the two operating segments are supplemented by corporate costs  which include expenses for selling support functions such as customer service  bids processing  product registration and marketing expense 
in addition  merchant discounts that are incurred for the extension of customer payment terms  general and administrative expense  new service center pre opening expenses  and interest and taxes are all reported as corporate costs 
refinancing in conjunction with the sale of its supply chain assets to tcs  the company amended its million facility 
the facility matures october  and is secured by inventory  owned receivables  equipment  investment interests  real property interests  and general intangibles  including intellectual property 
the facility bears interest at libor plus  and there is a facility fee of on the unused portion 
availability under the facility is determined by a borrowing base formula calculated on eligible inventory 
as of december   there was million available  based on the borrowing base formula 
letters of credit  up to a maximum of million  are also available under the facility and are considered outstanding borrowings when calculating the unused portion of availability 
letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million were outstanding resulting in unused borrowing capacity of million as of december  letter of credit fees were fixed at with an issuance fee fixed at 
the facility requires the maintenance of certain covenants  with the only financial covenant being the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with the facility covenants as of december  relocation of corporate headquarters during  we entered into agreements to relocate our corporate headquarters from our approximately  square foot facility in strongsville  ohio to an approximately  square foot facility in downtown cleveland  ohio 
relocation costs incurred during were million and were related primarily to tenant and landlord inducements along with broker commissions and legal fees 
in  the financial effect of the relocation was accretive to earnings on a pre tax basis by over million 
as part of the relocation  we reduced our lease commitment for corporate offices by five years as the lease on the strongsville facility expires in while the current corporate headquarters lease expires in vendor contract termination in  we notified kpac holdings  inc kpac  our supplier of methylene urea fertilizer  that we were terminating our performance under a five year supply agreement 
the agreement  signed in november  required the company to purchase annually  tons of methylene urea fertilizer at a fixed conversion cost of per ton 
management estimated that terminating the supply agreement would generate an annual  pre tax savings of more than million over the remaining term of the agreement  which aggregate savings are expected to exceed the million cost to exit the supply agreement 
other deferred tax asset valuation reserves in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
in making this assessment  we considered historical earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
the recent cumulative losses  including those generated from the supply chain transaction and other strategic initiatives  create uncertainty about the realization of the tax benefits in future years which cannot be overcome by other available evidence 
as a result  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to fully reserve for the company s net deferred tax assets as of december  business segment results vs 
concurrently with the sale of the supply chain assets  lesco revised its segment reporting and now manages the business utilizing two business segments stores and direct  which are supplemented by corporate support functions 
the following are the operating results of each of our operating segments 
earnings before interest and taxes ebit is a non gaap financial measure that reflects our earnings before the payment of interest on indebtedness and taxes 
we use ebit as a measure of the profitability of our segments because it excludes the effects of our capitalization structure and taxes 
interest and taxes are accounted and paid for on a consolidated company basis 
neither capitalization structure nor taxes reflects the efficiency of the operation of our segment assets 
additionally  we use ebit in determining whether to finance a project with debt or equity 
ebit should not be considered an alternative to net income loss calculated in accordance with gaap

we maintain four wall p ls for each service center and stores on wheels 
these four wall p ls include the sales  cost of sales and operating expenses including payroll  benefits  rent  utilities  in bound freight to selling locations and out bound freight to customers necessary to operate the individual selling locations 
the stores segment operating results reflect the aggregate four wall p ls of service center and stores on wheels selling locations adjusted for vendor and customer rebates  sales commission expense  warehouse and distribution costs  and merchant discounts and other income and expense items not directly charged to the four wall p ls

service center sales for the stores opened in the last three years were million 
we plan to open up to additional service centers in stores on wheels stores on wheels gross sales for the year reflect sales transacted through our stores on wheels in operation as of december   including new stores on wheels placed into service during the total gross sales increase of in was predominantly driven by the incremental units on a year over year basis 
the vast majority of the new stores on wheels were added in markets where lesco already had a presence through an existing stores on wheels unit or a golf direct sales representative 
the golf direct sales representative model was essentially disbanded and merged into the stores on wheels operations in the first half of resulting in employee turnover and a corresponding decline in sales 
we anticipate placing up to three new units into operation in net sales adjustments the company has entered into agency agreements with certain of its suppliers whereby the company operates as a sales agent of those suppliers 
the suppliers retain title to their merchandise until it is sold by the company and determine the prices at which lesco can sell the suppliers merchandise 
as such  the company recognizes sales on a net basis and records only its product margin as revenue 
agency sale adjustments  combined with freight revenue  which represents fees charged to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  and customer discounts and rebates decreased million in compared to gross profit on sales gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase is an outcome of the company s improved pricing strategy implemented throughout and meaningful margin rate gains in the grass seed  control  and fertilizer product categories 
this expansion in product margin is despite an approximate year over year comparative price increase for urea and increased fuel surcharges in urea is used as the nitrogen source for blended fertilizers and combination products 
urea can represent from approximately to of our cost of sales 
urea is a second derivative of natural gas and its cost has increased with the increased cost of natural gas 
for  we entered into a contract with our urea supplier to fix the cost of a majority of our urea needs at a price reflecting the prevailing market 
fuel surcharges  included in our costs of distributing product to the selling locations  nearly doubled on a year over year basis  compounded by the incremental locations added to the distribution network 
as a measure of the productivity of our significant investment in real estate and inventory  the company analyzes the gross profit on sales per square foot of rental space for each of the service center classes 
this non gaap measure is calculated by dividing gross profit on sales for each service center class by its respective leased square footage 
the following table illustrates the improvement in this metric on a year over year basis gross profit per square foot of service centers twelve months ended december  class of stores class of stores class of stores prior to stores total per square foot leased as the company continues to increase the service center footprint in existing markets  the prior to gross profit on sales per square foot metric initially will decrease due to sales transfers to new locations 
the estimated impact on this metric is a near term reduction of approximately selling expense selling expense includes all operating expenses of service centers and stores on wheels  and field management 
the increase of million  or of net sales  to million  or of net sales  in is directly attributable to million for new service centers and million for the stores on wheels openings 
other significant increases  on a year over year basis  were million for the expansion of the field management team to enhance the structure to support future store growth and million incremental field personnel incentive compensation due to the achievement of sales and productivity goals 
the majority of the remaining increase is related to the new systems connectivity and technology that was deployed into the service centers beginning in and completed in the second quarter of merchant discounts merchant discount fees incurred for regular payment terms increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the previous year 
this increase as a percentage of net sales was driven by a shift in mix of customer credit usage towards higher cost bank cards from the company s private label credit program 
bank card usage increased to of sales in from in loss earnings before interest and taxes during  lesco increased its service center base by  adding service centers to its base of stores at the end of management views new service centers as the primary method to leverage our cost base and grow earnings consistently over the long term

see management s discussion regarding the use of ebit on page direct segment the direct segment consists of direct sales non store to national account customers  including large retailer accounts  along with the operations of lesco sales representatives 
similar to the stores segment  we maintain four wall p ls for each direct segment unit and adjust for the same indirect income and expense items

the decrease of in compared to is primarily attributable to the year over year decline of in sales to customers in the golf industry reflecting the effect of our disbanded golf sales representatives program 
the decline in year over year golf sales is attributable to both the inclement weather during the first quarter in the northeast and midwest regions of the country along with the previously described transition of our golf direct sales and stores on wheels sales channels 
we continue to evaluate the return on investment relative to our contract accounts and have instituted disciplines to assure contracts meet acceptable return thresholds 
we analyze customer profitability across the entire company as certain national account customers may elect to transact sales in our stores segment as well as in our direct segment 
this program has  on occasion  resulted in lost contract sales  and we will continue to eliminate direct sales that do not produce an acceptable level of return on our overall investment 
net sales adjustments net sales adjustments decreased million in compared to as freight revenue  which represents fees charged to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  declined  and customer discounts and rebates increased as the company implemented a customer incentive plan targeted at garnering market share for specific lesco branded products 
gross profit on sales gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in as the company analyzed the profitability of major national accounts  contractual agreements and or pricing were renegotiated to improve lesco s return on investment 
the effect of these actions is demonstrated in the gross profit rate improvement by quarter in the direct segment as follows gross profit rate for the quarter ended march june september december the decline in gross profit in the third quarter of is due to the deleveraging of allocated fixed warehousing and distribution costs 
after the sale of the supply chain assets to tcs at the start of the fourth quarter  these costs became variable and this change is evidenced in the improved gross profit rate reflected in the fourth quarter results 
based on the change in our operating model  we anticipate gross profit on sales to be approximately in selling expense selling expense includes all operating expenses of direct sales activities  including  but not limited to  payroll and related costs  incentive compensation  trade shows  and targeted marketing campaigns 
in  selling expense declined million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the primary reductions in selling expense are million of payroll and million in incentive compensation due to the restructuring of our direct sales representative model in the first half of  and million of marketing expense based on a reduced number of campaigns 
merchant discounts merchant discounts increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the previous year 
the merchant discounts expense includes fees incurred for regular payment terms and the write off of specifically identified customer accounts receivable which were owned directly by the company or under a recourse agreement with gebcs  our private label business credit provider 
the write offs were recorded at million  or of net sales  in compared to no write off activity in this segment in loss earnings before interest and taxes as a result of the reduction in selling expense  offset by gross profit dollar decline and increase in merchant discounts  earnings before interest and taxes grew to million in from million in corporate the two operating segments are supplemented by corporate costs incurred for support functions  including corporate selling expenses consisting of marketing costs  general and administrative expenses  any charges and all costs from the manufacturing and distribution facilities  marketing costs  merchant discounts for promotional activities  pre opening costs for new service centers and stores on wheels  and other expenses that are not allocated to the stores and direct segments 
gross profit on sales corporate costs include the markdown of product for the strategic initiatives implemented by lesco in these markdowns include million for product rationalization to eliminate certain under performing sku s  million for parts inventory to restructure the company s parts sourcing model  and million for inventory disposed in conjunction with the supply chain transaction 
in  the company terminated its supply contract with kpac holdings  inc and incurred a million charge for markdown costs associated with the supplier product that the company removed from its merchandise offering 
selling expense corporate selling expense  composed of customer service  bids processing  product registration and marketing expenses  was million and million in and  respectively 
the majority of the increase on a year over year basis is related to the company s new direct marketing initiatives incurred of million 
merchant discounts merchant discounts increased million to million from million in the previous year 
the merchant discounts expense includes promotional discount term fees incurred for the extension of customer payment terms and the net change in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in  promotional discount terms were of consolidated net sales compared to in the increase was driven by market conditions necessitating more aggressive promotional offerings combined with customer participation at higher than historical levels 
pre opening expense pre opening expense increased million in compared to results

general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased by million in to million  or of consolidated net sales  compared to million  or of consolidated net sales  in the net decrease in expense year over year is due to lower expenses related to the company s corporate headquarters lease and related costs  reduced management incentive costs  and a reduction or elimination of some expenses as a result of the supply chain transaction  offset by million for expenses associated with a stock option repurchase from a former executive and severance costs related to the departure of the company s former president and chief executive officer in the fourth quarter of supply chain transaction expense on october   the company announced that it had completed the sale to tcs of its supply chain assets and consumable products inventory  including fertilizer  seed  control products  combination products  and related products

the company incurred million in charges in  including million of expense to close the four distribution hubs that were not purchased by tcs 
the charges primarily were related to the loss on sale of certain assets 
vendor contract termination in the fourth quarter of  we informed our supplier of methylene urea fertilizer  kpac holdings  inc  that the company would no longer operate under the terms of its supply agreement with kpac 
in the second quarter of  the company and kpac reached a settlement through a court appointed mediator

however  through price increases and other cost of sales reductions  particularly the cost per ton to blend fertilizer products  we successfully mitigated its effect on product margin

liquidity and capital resources a summary of the change in cash and cash equivalents see statement of cash flows included in the attached consolidated financial statements is as follows twelve months ended december  dollars in millions cash provided by operations cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents in january  the securities and exchange commission issued additional guidance for the reporting of cash flows from the sale of accounts receivable 
as such  the cash generated from the sale of our accounts receivable is now reflected in the operating activities section of our cash flows statement when  historically  it was reflected in financing activities 
below is a reconciliation of gaap reported cash flows from operations to a non gaap presentation that excludes the sale of accounts receivable twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities gaap less cash received for sale of accounts receivable less cash received for sale of inventory to tcs adjusted cash used in provided by operating activities non gaap adjusted cash provided by operating activities is a non gaap financial measure 
it should not be considered an alternative to cash provided by operating activities as calculated in accordance with gaap 
we believe the adjustments to cash provided by operating activities are useful because we do not expect to generate significant cash flow from future sales of non store inventory and sales of accounts receivable and believe investors should be aware of how that will affect our cash provided by operating activities calculated in accordance with gaap 
as a result of selling the supply chain assets and related working capital  the company received million for inventory that resided in the transferred facilities 
additionally  due to the outsourcing to the gebcs private label credit program in  we have sold a majority of our accounts receivable from the sale of products on a permanent basis and no longer generate significant accounts receivable from our sale of products 
as of december   million of our accounts receivable relate to sales made to international and domestic customers not included in the private label credit program 
investors should not expect us to generate cash flows from reduction in inventory or sales of accounts receivable in the future in the same magnitude as in and excluding the cash generated from the sale of inventory to tcs  cash was used by operations to increase inventory in as the company opened new service centers and new stores on wheels 
in  the company made a cash payment of million to settle a vendor dispute related to a supply contract the company terminated in we will merchandise each new service center with  to  of inventory and a new stores on wheels with  of inventory 
as such  we anticipate that inventory levels will increase with the opening of new service centers  but continued improvements in supply chain efficiencies  along with continued accounts payable leverage  could mitigate the impact of incremental product requirements 
accounts payable leverage is summarized as follows twelve months ended december dollars in millions accounts payable inventory accounts payable leverage capital expenditures our capital expenditures can be summarized as follows twelve months ended december  dollars in millions stores new other manufacturing facilities and corporate systems we expect to focus our future capital needs primarily on service centers 
we intend to open up to units in  relocate another existing sites to new locations with the intent to increase customer traffic and invest in new fixtures for our current base of stores to enhance merchandise adjacencies and improve the in store shopping experience 
we will continue to maintain information systems and other assets that support the operating segments 
we currently estimate that ongoing  annual capital needs will range from million to million  which we expect to fund with cash generated from operations 
in conjunction with the sale of its supply chain assets to tcs  the company amended its million revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility matures october  and is secured by inventory  owned receivables  equipment  investment interests  real property interests  and general intangibles  including intellectual property 
the facility bears interest at libor plus  and a facility fee of is payable on the unused portion 
availability under the facility is determined by a borrowing base formula calculated on eligible inventory 
as of december   there was million available  based on the borrowing base formula  with unused borrowing capacity of million 
letters of credit  up to a maximum of million  are also available under the facility and are considered outstanding borrowings when calculating the unused portion of availability 
letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million were outstanding as of december  letter of credit fees were fixed at with an issuance fee fixed at 
the facility requires the maintenance of certain covenants  with the only financial covenant being the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with the facility covenants as of december  we believe that the company s financial condition continues to be strong 
together  its cash balances  other liquid assets  expected operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets  and borrowing capacity are expected to provide adequate resources to fund short term and long term operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to service center expansion and other projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
for example  the company is contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  and accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and the disclosures made herein  with the audit committee of the board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the notes to consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of financial condition contain various references and disclosures concerning our accounting policies 
additionally  we have identified each of the following as a critical accounting policy  either because it has the potential to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  because of the significance of the financial item to which it relates  or because it requires judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
revenue recognition the company s sales are comprised of five major revenue classifications sales of owned product to customers  sales of vendor consigned products  sales of product under agency arrangements  freight revenue  and contra sales recorded for customer discounts and rebates 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  generally at the point of sale to a customer or when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
the company s shipping terms are fob shipping point and title passes to the customer at the time of shipment 
we have consigned inventory agreements on certain products 
we report gross revenue from the sales of consigned inventory in accordance with emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
sales of consigned inventory  which are included in gross sales  were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
additionally  we have agency agreements with vendors for which we recognize sales net as an agent 
agency sales are initially recorded at their gross amount and then reduced by the portion of revenue that exceeds the company s earned commission 
commissions included in net sales were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  revenues generated in transactions for shipping and handling services are included in net sales 
additionally  the related costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of product to determine the company s gross profit on sales 
certain customers receive discounts or rebates for purchases made from the company 
the discount or rebate is recorded as a reduction to sales in the period in which the sale transaction occurs as there is no expected future benefit to be derived from the discount or rebate 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from vendors under purchase rebate  cooperative advertising and other contractual programs and trade receivables not financed through outside programs 
the company earns product discounts under various supplier rebate programs  which are recorded as accounts receivable and a reduction to inventory when earned 
the company provides for expected losses from all owned and recourse accounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
expected losses are estimated based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  historical loss experience of the company  historical loss experience of credit portfolios with characteristics similar to the company s portfolio and the current business environment 
inventories inventories are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out cost method or market 
vendor rebates earned on purchases are recorded as a reduction to inventory on hand and recognized when the inventory is sold 
the company maintains an inventory life cycle program that requires the classification of all stock keeping units skus into one of five categories active  watch  phase out  discontinued and liquidated 
skus identified as discontinued are progressively marked down to expected net realizable value over specific periods until the costs are marked down to zero 
at that point  the products are liquidated and purged from the inventory system 
estimated net realizable value of of cost is based on historical sales of discontinued inventory 
at december   a change in net realizable value of current discontinued inventory would affect the reserve by approximately  we maintain a reserve for inventory shrink on a specific location basis 
this reserve is based on historical company wide experience of of sales until the location obtains two physical inventory audits performed by a third party inventory control organization 
the site specific reserve rate is then adjusted to reflect the average shrink rate from the two physical inventory counts 
actual shrink at the time of each physical inventory count is charged against the reserve 
a change in the rate of inventory shrink of of sales would have impacted the reserve for shrink by approximately  at december  income taxes the company uses the liability method whereby income taxes are recognized during the fiscal year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial statement income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
in accordance with that standard  the company recorded a million valuation allowance equal to its net deferred tax assets  including amounts related to its net operating loss carryforwards  as of december  the company intends to maintain a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of some portion or the remainder of the allowance 
until such time  the company will have no reported tax provision  net of valuation allowance adjustments 
any future decision to reverse a portion or all of the remaining valuation allowance will be based on consideration of several factors including  but not limited to  the company s expectations regarding future taxable income and the company s cumulative income or loss in the then most recent three year period 
in the event the company was to determine  based on the existence of sufficient positive evidence  that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of the company for additional information regarding income taxes 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets the company assesses the recoverability of its long lived assets by determining whether the amortization of the remaining balance over its remaining useful life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment exists  the carrying amount of the related asset is reduced to fair value 
during  the company recorded a million impairment expense for assets related to the closing of four distribution hubs that were not purchased by tcs 
the impairment was based on the net realizable value of the assets less the costs to dispose 
these facilities were closed as of december  accrued liabilities certain accrued liabilities  including employee health insurance and workers compensation  are estimated based on historical experience and lag analysis due to the difference between the time the expense is incurred and when the expense is paid 
a valuation analysis is performed to estimate the accrual required for property and casualty insurance claims expense 
accrued environmental costs are estimated based on the company s previous environmental contamination and remediation experience along with site specific conditions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements inventory costs in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends arb no 
 chapter and seeks to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials by requiring those items to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that fixed production overheads be allocated to conversion costs based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective prospectively for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial statements 
share based payments in december  the fasb issued statement revised  share based payment sfas r  which became effective for us on january  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of the grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
in addition  companies must recognize compensation expense related to any stock based awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provision of sfas no 
management believes that the pro forma information provided under stock based compensation in the consolidated financial statements provides a reasonable estimate of the projected impact of adopting sfas r on the company s results of operations

it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted this pronouncement in fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  principally interest rate risk 
market risk can be measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates over time 
interest paid on the company s debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate for the facility is variable  while the interest component of its operating leases is generally fixed 
the company believes its potential exposure to interest rate risk is not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we have used derivative financial and other instruments  where appropriate  to manage those risks 
we do not enter into transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we do not have contracts outstanding relative to interest rate risk 
we do have certain supply contracts that are discussed further under the heading contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements in md a
