item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding of the consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations of international absorbents and absorption 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
some statements and information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are not historical facts but are forward looking statements 
for a discussion of these forward looking statements and important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward looking statements  see item a risk factors and forward looking statements above 
overview international absorbents is the parent company of its wholly owned us subsidiary  absorption 
international absorbents is a holding company and absorption is its operating entity 
management divides the activities of the operating company into two segments the animal care industry and the industrial commercial industry 
we manufacture  distribute and sell products for these segments to both distributors and direct buying retailers 
absorption is a leading manufacturer and seller of premium small animal bedding in north america 
the primary product that we sell in this market is small animal bedding sold under the brand name carefresh 
we consider the activities that surround the manufacture and distribution of carefresh to be our core business 
our business strategy is to promote and grow our core business and to create diversification in our market channels  our production methods  and our product lines in an effort to add strength and breadth to our business structure 
as a result  we are dedicating significant resources to both building infrastructure for the support of our core business and creating more product and customer diversification 
we believe that this strategy has started to provide results 
specifically  we continue to grow sales in our core business and improve the production process of our core carefresh product while expanding sales of new products and existing products in new market channels 
even though top line financial results from fiscal year met the expectations of management  bottom line results did not 
as described below in net sales under results of operations sales growth was at the high end of our forecasted growth range 
the source of the failure to meet expectations on bottom line results was mainly caused by items related to our cost of goods sold 
these factors included slower than expected commissioning times for our georgia facility  higher than expected raw materials costs  and exceedingly high energy and transportation expenses resulting from economic strains on the energy market 
all of these related factors were the driving force behind our reduction in gross profits as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we discuss these issues and describe how we are changing the business in response  below in gross profit under results of operations 
during the second quarter of this fiscal year we introduced two new products to the animal care market healthy pet cat litter and carefresh colors 
healthy pet cat litter is a line of cat litters through which our distributors are offered a selection of five cat litters designed to be displayed together in one section of shelf space 
they are all made of natural products in keeping with our corporate environmentally friendly philosophy 
carefresh colors is a colored bedding offering designed to fit into our product line as a step up from carefresh ultra  our white small animal bedding offering 
the roll out process for both of these products continued through the third quarter of fiscal year sales of carefresh colors exceeded expectations while sales of healthy pet cat litter did not meet expectations during the last half of the year 
because these are new product lines  management believes it is too early in their respective sales life cycles to be able to predict if these trends will continue 
even though we are currently experiencing significant infrastructure related costs  we believe our progress with the sales of new product lines will continue to move us toward developing more diversified sources of income  which we anticipate will help reduce the risks associated with a substantial reliance on sales from a single product

net sales of our animal care products grew from  to  between january  and january  net sales of our industrial products grew from  to  between january  and january  our core product line  carefresh  continues to gain market share in the pet specialty market channel 
our strategy of diversification also showed some success with the continued growth of pet products such as carefresh ultra and critter care  due to increased shelf facings and a reduction in the price of carefresh ultra 
our strategy in regard to our industrial line of products has remained the same  which is to effectively service existing customers while focusing growth on consumer products 
during the balance of fiscal year  sales of natural  non colored carefresh in pet specialty channels are expected to be approximately the same as they were in fiscal year  because we have now reached significant levels of distribution throughout the united states  however  we have also introduced line extensions such carefresh ultra and carefresh colors 
therefore  although we anticipate that natural carefresh will continue to represent the majority of our sales through the fiscal year  we also see growth opportunities for all of our bedding products in the mass merchandiser and grocery market channels 
our products are selling well in these channels and are becoming more accepted by the consumer 
we continue to expect revenue growth from our lines of cat litter but believe that the growth rate may be tempered by our regional roll out strategy and production limitations 
at this time we do not have plans to invest additional sales resources in our industrial line of products 
we expect our fiscal year overall annual net sales to grow to over our fiscal year net sales levels 
gross profit our georgia production facility continued to make progress during the fourth quarter of fiscal year at increasing its production rate and efficiencies 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  the georgia facility reached break even as a stand alone gross profit center 
all of our facilities are still working to overcome the additional burden of major increases in utility rates  increased depreciation  and increased fuel surcharges on freight  all of which contributed to the reduction of our gross profit margin during fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
these increased production costs  combined with increased promotional expenses  which reduced our net revenue  resulted in a decreased gross margin gross profit divided by sales for the fiscal year just completed  as compared to fiscal year specifically  our gross margin decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  while gross profit decreased from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year one significant factor in the reduction of our gross profit was the increase in our depreciation as a result of our plant expansion that has taken place over the past three years 
depreciation  which we have attributed to plant and equipment  has grown from  in fiscal year  to  in fiscal year operating income before depreciation for our animal care product segment decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year operating loss before depreciation for our industrial product segment increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year for fiscal year we will continue to expect that our gross margin will remain in the range of to 
the reasons for this expectation are as follows 
first  the cost savings we had projected from reduced transportation costs resulting from shipping to east coast customers from the georgia production facility have been offset by the large increases in fuel charges 
however  without this facility being located where it is  margin expectations would be even lower 
second  we are not achieving the overall reduced costs of raw materials that we had expected  due to our product mix  slow reaction of materials suppliers and increases in petroleum based product prices  such as the cost of plastic bags and the lack of key low cost raw material sources 
we are also still studying whether to move our bellingham  washington production facility to our new ferndale  washington location 
if this move occurs  it will begin during fiscal year if we decide to move we will incur relocation and commissioning costs  which could further reduce our gross margin 
additional depreciation charges  resulting from our new production facilities  will also have a negative effect on our gross margin 
to offset the extreme increases in the cost of natural gas  we are in the process of installing new burners to heat our dryers at our georgia facility that operate at less than one third the cost of our current natural gas burners 
they are expected to be in operation sometime during the first quarter of fiscal year we plan to continue to make capital investments in technology to decrease the cost of production 
selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  as compared to  in fiscal year costs resulting from our compliance with sec and amex requirements have started to have an impact on our general and administrative expenses 
moreover  we now have overhead expenses related to operating our georgia facility  increased property taxes on both of our new facilities  and increased depreciation expense 
we anticipate that these factors will continue to increase general and administrative expenses during fiscal year during the fiscal year  we intend to continue our marketing initiatives  though at a scaled down rate 
we adjusted and completed our sales staff expansion plan during fiscal year we feel that with this plan in place we will be able to achieve our strategic objectives without significantly increasing the our selling expenses 
this projection may change depending on the reaction of our competitors 
interest expense interest expense in fiscal year totaled  as compared to  in fiscal year this increase was due to interest charges for the debt facility for the georgia plant 
if we move our bellingham  washington facility during fiscal year we will incur interest charges related to the resulting financing 
these additional financing charges are not expected to occur until the fourth quarter of fiscal year income tax absorption incurred federal income taxes during fiscal year at an effective rate of 
losses incurred in canada by international absorbents have been fully reserved through the recording of a valuation allowance as canadian net operating losses and deferred tax assets are not expected to be utilized in future periods 
net income our net income for the year ended january  decreased to  as compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was the result of increased cost of goods sold costs related to the commissioning of the georgia production facility  increased depreciation  increased energy and higher freight charges  increased promotional expenses  increased marketing expenses  and increased general and administrative expenses related to our compliance with regulatory requirements 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  however  as a percentage of sales these expenses remained virtually flat and such increase was not as significant as the increase in cost of goods sold 
as such we feel that the significant factors relating to our reduced net income are those related to our cost of goods sold 
we feel that continued concentration on the implementation of the key components of our business plan that focus on production efficiencies and costs will provide us with continued increases in production rates  which should help us to service the increase in demand for our products and generate revenues 
we expect that the production efficiencies that we saw at our georgia facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal year will continue 
with these efficiencies now stabilized and moving in the right direction  we expect to be able to produce product at the higher end of our gross margin projections  unless there are downward pressures from the costs of raw materials or energy 
we project that selling and administrative costs will continue to grow  but only marginally during the coming fiscal year 
we will continue to invest in future marketing programs to offset competitive pressures as necessary and anticipate additional administrative costs resulting from regulatory requirements  all of which may continue to lead to increased expenses and lower net income 
during fiscal year we are likely to add additional interest expense as a result of financing the move of our bellingham  washington production facility 
in addition  we anticipate that increased depreciation resulting from our investment in plant and equipment will negatively affect our fiscal year net income 
comparison of the years ended january  and net sales our sales grew from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this sales growth amounted to a increase over the previous fiscal year 
net sales of our animal care products grew from  to  between january  and january  net sales of our industrial products decreased from  to  between january  and january  our core product  carefresh  continued to gain market share in the pet specialty market channel 
our strategy of diversification also showed some success with the continued growth of pet products such as carefresh ultra and critter care  due to increased shelf facings since mid year 
our strategy in regard to our industrial line of products remained the same  which was to effectively service existing customers while focusing growth on consumer products 
consequently  industrial sales remained flat during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit by focusing on the operations portion of our business plan during fiscal year  we were able to maintain the same gross margin gross profit divided by sales achieved in the prior fiscal year  even though we incurred additional expenses as a result of the start up of our new production facility in georgia 
three areas of focus were the primary factors for this improvement 
first  by moving into our new ferndale  washington facility we eliminated approximately  in annual lease payments 
second  we successfully encouraged customers to purchase products in package sizes that utilize more labor efficient methods and are more cost effective to ship 
third  we continued to increase production rates while reducing some of the associated fixed costs 
as a result  we maintained our gross margin at in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year  while gross profit increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year as expected  the largest factor in the reduction of our gross margin  from the higher levels experienced during the first three quarters of fiscal year to the fiscal year end levels  was the cost associated with the start up our our new production facility in georgia 
our operating income before depreciation for our animal care product segment increase from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year our operating loss before depreciation for our industrial product segment increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  as compared to  in fiscal year the entire increase was attributable to increased investment in sales and marketing 
we continued to invest in marketing activities to support the diversification aspect of our business plan 
we have also grown to the point that our competition has taken notice of us and our products 
as such  we had to invest in marketing programs focused on protecting the growing market share of our core product 
interest expense interest expenses in fiscal year totaled  as compared to  in fiscal year income taxes absorption  for its us operations  fully utilized as of the second quarter of fiscal all of its us tax net operating losses 
during fiscal year  we also recorded a valuation allowance in the amount of  for international absorbent s canadian deferred income tax assets  as compared to  for fiscal year net income we believe that our strong results for the first nine months of fiscal year helped us absorb the significant start up costs incurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as a result of the initial commissioning of the georgia production facility 
our net income for fiscal year increased to  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a increase 
this increase resulted from maintaining prior year gross margins on increased sales  even though we incurred the commissioning costs associated with the start up of a new production facility 
we also kept the growth rate of selling and administrative costs below that of sales  which helped to off set our increased interest expenses 
also  during fiscal year we put into place components of our business plan 
these included investments in capital infrastructure  sales and marketing programs  and cost management controls 
we believe the results for fiscal year reflected the effects of having successfully completed the implementation of these components of our business plan 
we feel that implementation of the key components of our business plan resulted in the continued increases in net revenues  improvements in gross profits and continued controls over overhead expenses 
these steps allowed us to continue to invest in sales and marketing activities and capital infrastructure 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal year we completed the second phase of our three phase capital expansion plan 
this three phase plan includes the building of the new manufacturing and warehousing facility in ferndale  washington  which is now complete  the building of a new production facility in georgia  which has also been completed  and the move of the bellingham  washington manufacturing facility to the ferndale  washington location 
the final phase will occur only if our economic analysis concludes that it is an optimal choice 
the intent of this capital expansion plan is first  to protect our core business by reducing our production costs and decreasing the cost of shipping product to our customers  second  to give us the ability to manufacture  warehouse and distribute a wider diversity of product  and third  to increase our production capacity 
the table below illustrates the effects this capital expansion plan has had on our financial statements us dollars in thousands as of january as of january financial condition total assets total liabilities total stockholders equity debt equity ratio assets debt ratio working capital current assets current liabilities current ratio cash position cash  restricted cash investments cash generated from operations financial condition during fiscal year  the value of our assets increased as we worked toward completion of the commissioning of our facility in georgia  a portion of which was paid for through long term debt and a portion through cash 
our total assets were  at january  compared to  at january  we also had a slight increase in total liabilities from  at january  to  at january  as a result of an increase in short term accounts payable 
on september   absorption entered into a letter of credit and reimbursement agreement with bb t  pursuant to which we requested that a the wayne county ida issue  aggregate principal amount of wayne county s tax exempt bonds pursuant to an indenture by and between bb t  as trustee  and wayne county and b bb t issue to absorption an irrevocable letter of credit naming the trustee as beneficiary in the amount of  of the total proceeds from the financing   were used to pay off our prior indebtedness to bb t   was paid for costs of issuance and the remaining proceeds of  were placed in a trust account to be used to finish the construction of our new production facility located in georgia 
for the issued bonds to receive tax exempt status  wayne county ida purchased absorption s real property in georgia from absorption  and is leasing the real property back to absorption at a lease rate equal to the bond payments  with the lease payments payable directly to bb t 
upon repayment of the bonds in full  wayne county ida will transfer all right  title and interest in the real property and related production facility to absorption for no additional consideration 
while the bonds remain outstanding  as security for the indebtedness underlying the letter of credit  bb t will hold a mortgage on the real property and a security interest in the equipment assets located on that property 
the bond has a variable rate equal to bb t s variable rate demand bond vrdb rate as of march   and absorption is also required to pay an annual letter of credit fee equal to of the initial amount of the letter of credit  an annual remarketing fee equal to of the initial amount of the letter of credit and a  annual trustee fee 
the term of the bonds is years  maturing on september   and the term of the letter of credit is seven years  maturing on september  the equipment portion of the bonds is amortized over seven years and the real estate portion is amortized over years 
in addition  amounts owing under the letter of credit may be accelerated upon an event of default  including absorption s failure to pay any amount when due  or failure to perform any of its obligations or a breach of any of its representations or covenants under the agreement 
in connection with this financing  international absorbents agreed to unconditionally guarantee all of absorption s indebtedness to bb t 
at january   the balance outstanding was  in march  we completed a  bond financing  comprised of  as tax exempt and  as taxable 
the bonds were issued through the washington economic development finance authority in washington state 
the purchaser and holder of the bonds is ge capital public finance 
the tax exempt bonds have a fixed rate of  with a term of months  maturing february  and with interest only payments for the first months 
the taxable bonds have a fixed rate of  with a term of months  maturing august the indebtedness underlying the bonds is secured by a mortgage on our real property  and a security interest in our equipment assets  located in whatcom county  washington 
at january   the balance outstanding was  on the tax exempt and  on the taxable bonds  respectively 
our main credit risk exposure in fiscal year will come from meeting the covenants attached to our debt facilities by our lenders 
as of the end of fiscal year we were over minimum financial requirements and under maximum requirements 
the covenant related ratios that could have a potential risk in the future are those based on cash flow 
as such  any significant decrease in our current cash flow could result in the breach of one or more of these loan covenants 
working capital during fiscal year  our working capital position remained relatively flat 
current assets increased from  at the end of fiscal year to  at the end of fiscal year the majority of the increase in current assets occurred due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory  off set by a decrease in cash 
accounts receivable increased with increasing sales  inventories increased because we now have two production facilities  and cash decreased because of investments in property  plant  and equipment 
current liabilities increased from  at january  to  at january  these changes resulted in our current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities decreasing from at the end of fiscal year to at the end of fiscal year cash position we believe that our existing cash on hand  long term debt and available line of credit currently provide us with enough cash to meet our existing needs for the foreseeable future 
cash  restricted cash  and investments decreased during fiscal year from  at january  to  at january   primarily as a result of increases in accounts receivable and inventory and investments in property  plant  and equipment 
we expect cash to remain near current levels during fiscal year  if we move the bellingham  washington production facility 
if we don t elect to move our facility  then we expect cash to grow 
we will continue to closely monitor both current liabilities and current assets as they relate to the generation of cash  with an emphasis on maximizing potential sources of cash 
on may  absorption renewed its lease agreement with the port of bellingham  which extended the lease on our bellingham  washington production facility until august of on may   absorption renewed a bank line of credit agreement with bb t for up to  which is secured by accounts receivable and inventory of absorption 
interest is payable on funds advanced at the libor rate plus 
the line of credit matures on may  as of january   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit 
cash generated from operations during the fiscal year we generated  in cash from operations  generated by income from operations offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales and an increase in inventory levels due to building inventory at our georgia production facility 
if our sales continue to increase and we are able to continue to profitably produce our products  we should be able to continue to generate cash from operating activities  although it cannot be assured that this will be the case 
financing and investing activities cash used in financing activities during fiscal year was  this resulted from principal payments of  on long term debt offset by cash received of  from the issuance of shares as a result of the exercise of stock options 
cash was used during fiscal year for investing activities resulting from our capital expansion plan 
cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year was approximately  the majority of the cash was used to purchase equipment for both of our main production facilities and to purchase software and related computer hardware for our new enterprise resource planning erp system 
the first phase of our production expansion plan was substantially completed during the third quarter of fiscal year this was the construction of our new west coast facility located in ferndale  washington 
we had previously been operating in five separate long term leased facilities in whatcom county  washington 
this new facility  which was financed approximately half through debt and half through cash  has consolidated four of these leased facilities  resulting in what we anticipate to be an annual savings of approximately  in lease payments 
the consolidation of these facilities has also provided us with savings in other expenses caused by inefficient logistics 
the annual interest expense of the debt used to finance this facility is estimated to be approximately  per year 
phase two of our production expansion plan was the commissioning of the facility located in georgia 
we purchased approximately fifteen acres of real property in jesup  georgia  with an existing  square foot facility  during august for  which we subsequently sold to  and leased back from  wayne county ida  as described above 
we began construction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year on this property 
the total project was completed at a cost of  of the total cost  approximately  was financed through a long term bank debt instrument and the balance was financed with cash on hand 
the annual interest expense of the debt used to finance this facility is estimated to be approximately  a year 
this plant is now fully functional 
the third phase of our production expansion plan is the relocation of our bellingham  washington production facility to the new ferndale  washington facility 
we will undertake this move only if our economic analysis concludes that it is optimal 
we believe that this three phase plan will give us the ability to grow our business  achieve significant cost savings  better serve our customers  expand our production lines  diversify and expand our production capacity and physically move manufacturing in a manner which is transparent to the users of our products 
our contractual obligations for future payments are as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total environmental matters we are committed to being an environmentally friendly company and to manufacturing products which benefit the quality of the environment 
hazardous wastes are not produced  treated  or stored at any company owned or operated facilities 
state  federal  and local laws all have jurisdiction over production activities 
we believe we are currently in compliance with these laws and expect to remain so 
off balance sheet arrangements the sec requires companies to disclose off balance sheet arrangements 
as defined by the sec  an off balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation  agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  has a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  has an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or has any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the company 
we have examined our contractual obligation structures that may potentially be impacted by this disclosure requirement and have concluded that no arrangements of the types described above exist with respect to our company 
critical accounting policies introduction in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  judgments and estimates are made that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that the material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  including deferred income taxes and the related valuation allowance  accrual for self insured medical insurance plans and sales incentives 
as part of the financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base judgments and develop estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
historical experience and available information is used to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the significant accounting policies described in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
inventory finished goods inventory are valued at the lower of cost determined on the first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
cost includes direct materials  labor and overhead allocation 
raw materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost determined on the first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
unexpected change in market demand or buyer preferences could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to record a reserve for obsolescence 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we typically offer credit terms to our customers without collateral 
we record accounts receivable at the face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our accounts receivable and establish these allowances based on a combination of specific customer circumstances  as well as credit conditions and the history of write offs and collections 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
we obtain credit insurance for certain international accounts that qualify for coverage in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
at january  and january   management considered accounts receivable in excess of the allowances for doubtful accounts to be fully collectible 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment assets are recorded at cost 
our building and equipment are located on owned and leased land 
buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over a period of years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of the lease agreement for property located on leased land 
most of our equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life using a declining balance method  the remainder is depreciated using a straight line method over five years 
we have chosen to use the declining value method over a fixed period straight line method to better reflect the fair market value and useful life of equipment which is typically used in our facilities 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the time title passes to the purchaser  which is generally when the goods are conveyed to a carrier 
when we sell fo b 
destination point  title is transferred and we recognize revenue on delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales of the agreement 
sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
if the actual costs of sales returns and incentives were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
income tax we account for income tax on the liability method 
the liability method recognizes the amount of tax payable at the date of the financial statements as a result of all events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements  as measured by the provisions of currently enacted tax laws and rates 
the accumulated tax effect of all temporary differences is presented as deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities within the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  deferred income taxes and the related valuation allowance  accrual for self insured medical insurance plan  and sales incentives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
we have outstanding variable rate demand bonds from which our primary market rate risk arises 
the interest variability results from changes in bb t s capital markets low floater rate  upon which our variable bond interest rate is based 
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of in the interest rate of our variable rate bond obligations would be approximately  as of january   the outstanding principle of these bonds was  as of that date  the variable interest rate was 
the balance of our other outstanding bonds is subject to a fixed interest rate 
we currently are not subject to market risk arising from interest rate changes relating to our line of credit 
we have a line of credit extended from bb t  which has a variable interest rate based on the day libor rate 
we have never drawn on this line of credit and currently have no intention to draw on it in the foreseeable future 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments in the management of our financial rate exposures 
interest rate exposure is monitored through regular communications with senior management 
we would be exposed to higher interest rates through poor financial performance of bb t as a result of bb t supplying the irrevocable letter of credit attached to the bonds 
this credit risk is minimized by maintaining relationships with alternative financial institutions who could replace the irrevocable letter of credit 
we do not anticipate poor financial performance by our banking partner 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have a material exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies
