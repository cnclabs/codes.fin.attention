introduction medimmune is committed to advancing science to develop better medicines that help people live healthier  longer and more satisfying lives 
medimmune currently focuses its efforts on using biotechnology to produce innovative products for prevention and treatment in the therapeutic areas of infectious disease  cancer and inflammatory disease 
medimmune s scientific expertise is primarily in the areas of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines 
medimmune markets four products  synagis  flumist  ethyol and cytogam and has a diverse pipeline of development stage products 
overview total revenues for were billion  an increase of over billion in  primarily reflecting growth in sales of synagis to billion 
we reported a net loss for of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in both periods included significant charges associated with the acquisition of research and development r d assets that expanded our pipeline 
the results reflect the impact of million of charges for acquired in process research and development ipr d  and results include acquired ipr d and impairment charges totaling million for the reacquisition of wyeth s interest in the influenza vaccines franchise 
we continued to invest aggressively in building our future with r d expenditures excluding acquired ipr d increasing to of product sales in  compared to in  as we successfully completed multiple phase trials  filed three investigational new drug applications  and added new targets to our portfolio 
during  we amended our distribution arrangement with abbott international ai to include numax  which provides us with a larger portion of the economics from our respiratory syncytial virus rsv franchise outside the us and provides us with the opportunity in seven countries to participate directly in the commercialization of numax outside the united states 
we also amended our co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories abbott to take full responsibility for the sales and marketing of synagis in the us starting in the rsv season 
this will provide us with strategic and operational advantages as we prepare for the continued growth of the pediatric infectious disease component of our business 
during the fourth quarter  we successfully transitioned to the liquid formulation of synagis in the us from the lyophilized or freeze dried form 
the liquid formulation is a product improvement over the freeze dried formulation that we believe enhances the convenience for physicians in administering the drug and has the potential to reduce the waiting time for patients in doctors offices and reduce their exposure to sick children 
in october  we received regulatory approval in japan for the use of synagis as a prevention in pediatric patients with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease 
we also made substantial progress in our influenza vaccines franchise with the completion of our phase study to demonstrate clinical efficacy of caiv t over the flu shot 
preliminary data indicates that caiv t is more effective than the flu shot in preventing influenza disease caused by any influenza strain in children under years of age 
we also completed the phase study to bridge refrigerator stable caiv t to frozen flumist  which successfully demonstrated equivalent immunogenicity  and filed a supplemental biologics license application with the fda for approval to use caiv t in preventing influenza in healthy individuals to years of age 
in addition  we received approval by the us food and drug administration fda of our new bulk vaccine manufacturing facility in the united kingdom 
we are also actively pursuing government funding that may be available to us based manufacturers to develop the technology to manufacture influenza vaccines using cell culture 
although we do not expect frozen flumist to contribute meaningfully to our revenues until we introduce caiv t  we continue to focus on building awareness  support and usage of our live  attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine technology in anticipation of launching caiv t in we continued to advance the development of our third generation antibody product targeting rsv during with the completion of patient enrollment in two late stage trials with numax  in addition to several other supportive studies 
we completed enrollment in our pivotal phase study in which we are comparing the safety and efficacy of numax to synagis in reducing rsv hospitalizations in high risk infants 
we expect to have results from this trial in the second half of we also completed enrollment in a separate  late stage clinical safety study in the northern hemisphere in which numax will be compared to synagis for the first time in children with congenital heart disease 
research and development activities during also included the completion of a phase melanoma study with vitaxin and completion of patient enrollment in our phase prostate cancer study with vitaxin 
data from both of these trials will be evaluated in as we continue to invest in this molecule as a potential cancer therapeutic 
additionally  we filed three investigational new drug applications to begin clinical studies with our antibody candidate targeting lupus  our combination rsv and parainfluenza virus type piv vaccine candidate  and our hn pandemic vaccine under our research agreement with the national institutes of health 
during the year  we expanded our pipeline of potential product candidates through the in licensing and acquisition of new product candidates and technologies 
we licensed worldwide rights from glaxosmithkline gsk to develop certain anti staphylococcal monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of serious bloodstream infections caused by staphylococcus in low birthweight infants 
we also expanded our oncology pipeline through new collaborations with vasgene therapeutics  inc vasgene  seattle genetics  inc  and avidia  inc  in licensing agreements with georgetown university  biowa  inc  xencor  inc  and the burnham institute for medical research  and the acquisition of cellective therapeutics  inc cellective 
we also amended our licensing agreement for cervical cancer vaccines with gsk to receive milestone payments and royalties for both gsk and merck co  inc merck products 
in addition  we entered into a collaboration with avalon pharmaceuticals  inc avalon to discover and develop small molecule therapeutic compounds in the area of inflammatory disease 
we expanded our rsv research programs by entering into a license and collaboration agreement with biota holdings limited biota to develop and commercialize small molecule compounds designed to prevent and treat rsv infection 
we also acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to certain intellectual property owned by mount sinai school of medicine of new york university for reverse genetics in the production of influenza vaccines  we now own or have exclusive licenses to all of the key intellectual property for this technology 
during june  we settled the dispute with celltech r d ltd 
related to the adair patent  resulting in the dismissal of all pending litigation related to the patent 
under the terms of the settlement  we have no royalty obligation for sales of synagis before july   which was estimated to range up to million under the original license terms 
we agreed to pay celltech a royalty which is lower than the royalty rate called for in the original license agreement based on synagis sold or manufactured in the us after july  our overall royalty obligation with respect to sales of synagis will not materially change as a result of the settlement due to the ability to offset the payments to celltech against our royalty obligations to certain other licensors 
our cash and marketable securities at december  totaled billion as compared to billion as of december   reflecting the upfront payment of million to abbott in conjunction with the reacquisition of full promotion rights for synagis in the us  million paid to acquire the outstanding equity interests in cellective  net of cash acquired  as well as repurchases of approximately million shares of our common stock at a total cost of million 
as we look to the future  we intend to continue to focus on our long term strategic objectives  including supporting the continued growth of synagis and ethyol  developing flumist into a better influenza vaccine  developing numax as a differentiated successor to synagis  developing our pipeline through our own internal discovery and development efforts and by gaining access to new technologies through acquisition and in licensing arrangements  resulting in the introduction of two additional products by  elevating science and evolving our r d governance  and continuing to develop our people  processes and culture 
we have the following expectations for total revenue total revenues for reflected the strong finish for synagis for the rsv season that was moderated by the slower than expected start for the rsv season and the modest sales of frozen flumist for the influenza season 
we plan to take actions to address and  to the extent possible  mitigate the underlying issues for the slower than expected start to the rsv season 
for  we expect total revenues to grow by about percent to approximately billion 
synagis is expected to continue to comprise a majority of our product sales  accordingly  we believe our revenues and operating results will reflect the seasonality of that product s use to prevent rsv disease  which occurs primarily during the winter months 
we do not expect flumist to be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth before  when we expect to launch caiv t  an improved formulation of this influenza vaccine with a label including a broader age indication  in the united states 
accordingly  our flumist sales target is approximately three million doses and our marketing efforts are focused on building awareness  support and usage  particularly among pediatricians 
gross margin we expect that our gross margins  excluding stock compensation expense  will be approximately percent of product sales for the full year we anticipate that flumist will continue to exert downward pressure on gross margins until we successfully launch an improved formulation with a broader label 
we expect that gross margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  based on the product mix and reflecting the seasonality of synagis and flumist 
research and development expense we expect research and development expenses  excluding stock compensation expense  to be approximately million  or approximately percent of product sales 
we expect that slightly more than half of our current estimate will occur in the first half of the year 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a we expect sg a  excluding stock compensation expense  as a percentage of product sales to decrease to approximately percent of product sales 
co promotion expenses will cease mid year when we take full responsibility for sales of synagis in the united states 
the savings from reduced co promotion expenses will be partially offset by approximately million in annualized selling expense related to the addition of new sales representatives to our pediatric sales organization  bringing the total to about by the middle of this year 
the additional sales representatives will help us prepare for the anticipated continued growth of the pediatric infectious disease component of our business 
key opportunities in this area include the potential launch of caiv t in the fall of  the potential fall launch of numax  and the future potential of the anti staphylococcal antibody program we licensed from gsk 
stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires us to begin recognizing expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including stock options 
the compensation expense will be based on the fair value of the share based compensation award at the date of grant and allocated over the period in which the employee is required to render service in order to vest in the award 
the expense will be classified in cost of sales  research and development expense and sg a expense in the same manner as wages are recorded 
we anticipate that our pre tax stock based compensation expense will approximate million in stock compensation expense for certain stock options is not deductible until the employee exercises those options 
this will cause our overall effective tax rate to be approximately 
for a further discussion of the impact of this standard  refer to the section entitled new accounting standards below and in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity we believe that the holders of our convertible senior notes will require us to redeem the notes on or about july   as provided for under the senior notes indenture 
we anticipate using cash and investments on hand  a line of credit and or another type of financing instrument to repay these notes 
amendment of international distribution agreement with abbott international in february  we amended our international distribution agreement with ai to include the exclusive distribution of numax  our third generation anti rsv antibody that is currently in phase development  outside of the us  if and to the extent approved for marketing by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
under the amended terms of the agreement  ai pays us additional compensation as compared to the previous agreement  and such amounts in excess of estimated fair value for product sales of synagis are recognized as other revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
amendment of co promotion agreement with abbott in august  we amended our co promotion agreement with abbott for sales of synagis in the united states 
under the terms of the amended agreement  abbott will continue to provide promotional activities with respect to synagis until june   at which time we will take full responsibility for synagis sales and marketing in the united states 
we will continue to pay abbott for their co promotion services during the rsv season as provided for under the original agreement 
we have agreed to make certain incremental payments  as compared to the original agreement  to abbott  including milestone based payments and increased incentive payments contingent upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds during and in addition  if numax is not approved by the fda before september   we would pay abbott a portion of the proceeds from the sales of synagis in the us for up to a two year period beginning at such time 
the present value of the incremental payments that we deem probable have been recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and are as follows as of december  other current liabilities  million  other liabilities  million 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded an intangible asset of million which represents the estimated fair value of the exclusive promotion rights  determined as the aggregate present value of the probable incremental payments to be made as a result of the amended terms of the agreement in excess of the value of the co promotion services to be rendered  as determined under the previous agreement 
the intangible asset will be amortized ratably over future sales of synagis over the expected period of active sales and marketing in the us  which are projected to continue through the first half of  as we expect to launch numax during the rsv season 
acquisition of cellective therapeutics  inc 
on october   we acquired the outstanding equity interests of cellective  a privately held development stage biopharmaceutical company  for approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired of approximately million 
cellective has three preclinical stage programs developing monoclonal antibodies that target the b cell antigens cd  cd and cd  which are believed to play important roles in regulating the immune system and offer potential treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  we could pay cellective s shareholders future contingent payments of up to approximately million should the antibody programs achieve certain product development and sales milestones 
our wholly owned venture capital subsidiary  medimmune ventures  inc  owned approximately of the outstanding equity interests of cellective prior to the acquisition 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets  and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a charge for acquired ipr d of million during the fourth quarter of the charge for acquired ipr d is not deductible for tax purposes 
licensing and collaborative agreements in february  we amended our agreement with gsk for the development of hpv vaccines 
under the amended agreement  we may  in addition to receiving milestone payments and royalties from gsk  also receive certain milestone payments and royalties on future development and sales of an investigational hpv vaccine now in phase development by merck 
the fda is currently reviewing the biologics license application for merck s hpv vaccine under priority review  with a review goal date of mid merck has also submitted applications for regulatory approval in the european union  australia  mexico  brazil  argentina  taiwan and singapore 
gsk filed its application for regulatory approval for their hpv vaccine in the european union in march and expects to file in the us by the end of in august  we licensed worldwide rights from gsk to develop certain anti staphylococcal monoclonal antibodies 
we will be responsible for future research and development and any resulting second generation monoclonal antibodies as well as all future sales and marketing activities worldwide 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to an upfront fee  and potential milestone payments and royalties on any resulting marketed products 
we are also obligated to make future milestone and royalty payments to biosynexus  inc  from which gsk originally licensed the bsyx a antibody and related rights in  on behalf of gsk 
medimmune and gsk have been sued by biosynexus in connection with this transaction 
see note  legal proceedings  to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
in september  we entered into a collaborative agreement with vasgene to develop monoclonal antibodies targeting cancer 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of any resulting products 
vasgene received an upfront fee  and could receive development and regulatory milestone payments  as well as royalties on any resulting marketed products 
vasgene will provide research and development support 
in december  we entered into a licensing and collaborative agreement with biota to develop and commercialize biota s small molecule compounds designed to prevent and treat rsv 
under the terms of the agreement  biota received an upfront fee  and could receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments and royalties on any resulting marketed products 
also in december  we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to certain intellectual property owned by mount sinai school of medicine of new york university for the use of reverse genetics in the production of influenza vaccine  we now own or have exclusive licenses to all of the key intellectual property for this technology 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid mount sinai an upfront fee and agreed to potential milestone payments and royalties on any resulting future product sales 
we recorded charges totaling million during and million during associated with upfront fees and milestone payments under licensing agreements and research collaborations  which are included as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
new accounting standards on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires public companies to recognize expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including employee stock options  using a fair value based option pricing model 
adoption of the expense provisions of the statement will have a material impact on our results of operations going forward 
using the modified prospective transition method of adoption  we will reflect compensation expense in our financial statements beginning january  with no restatement of prior periods 
as such  compensation expense will be recognized for awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after january  as well as for the portion of awards previously granted that have not vested as of january  upon the adoption  we implemented the straight line expense attribution method  whereas our previous expense attribution method was the graded vesting method  an accelerated method  described by fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter to require that idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we adopted sfas for inventory costs on january   with an immaterial impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the sec issued an interpretive release entitled commission guidance regarding accounting for sales of vaccines and bioterror countermeasures to the federal government for placement into the pediatric vaccine stockpile or the strategic national stockpile 
this release addresses the timing of revenue recognition for the sale of vaccines related to federal governmental stockpile programs and allows revenue earned under these programs to be recognized when all of the revenue recognition criteria specified under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and sec rules and regulations are met  with the exception of those criteria that require a fixed schedule for delivery of goods and that the ordered goods must be segregated from the seller s inventory 
the alternative accounting method described in this release is effective on january  the new interpretive release does not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended december  however  the interpretive release may ease revenue recognition criteria for sales to the federal government under certain stockpile programs  and we may participate at a more significant level in such federal government stockpile programs in the future 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates have the greatest impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development of and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in process research and development when we enter into agreements to acquire early to late stage technology or product candidates  we assign value to acquired in process technologies by identifying those acquired specific in process research and development projects that will be continued and for which  as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility has not been established  there is no alternative future use  and the fair value is estimable with reasonable reliability 
during  we recorded a charge of million for acquired ipr d in conjunction with the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in cellective 
the charge represents the estimated relative fair value  as of the purchase date  of the acquired in process technologies and certain ipr d projects 
cellective has three preclinical stage programs developing monoclonal antibodies that target the b cell antigens cd  cd and cd  which are believed to play important roles in regulating the immune system and offer potential treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases 
we have valued the three preclinical stage programs equally 
significant efforts will be required to complete the projects and we do not anticipate material cash inflows until to years from the acquisition date  if ever 
the nature  timing and projected costs associated with the remaining efforts for completion are not reasonably estimable at this time 
as with all biotechnology products  the probability of commercial success for any one research and development project is highly uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within the projected completion dates and realization of the anticipated return on our investment include the inability to obtain and maintain access to intellectual property  failure in clinical trials  the inability to obtain required regulatory approvals  and the availability of competitive products 
if we fail to successfully advance cellective s antibody programs  we may not achieve the currently anticipated return on any investment we have made or will make 
during and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  for acquired ipr d in conjunction with our reacquisition of influenza vaccine franchise rights from wyeth in may the charges represent the estimated relative fair value  as of the purchase date  of the acquired in process technologies and certain ipr d projects  primarily caiv t  calculated utilizing the sum of probability adjusted commercial scenarios  or income approach 
the valuation was based upon management s estimates of the probability of fda and or other regulatory body approval and commercial success  including the estimated impact of the size of the indicated population  price  volume  timing of regulatory approval and any potential failure to commercialize the product 
caiv t is not expected to have the logistical and distribution issues associated with the frozen formulation and is expected to have an expanded label 
we did not believe that there will be any alternative future use for the in process technologies that were expensed as of the reacquisition date 
in valuing the purchased in process technologies  we estimated cash inflows based on extensive market research performed on the us marketplace and cash outflows for product costs  milestones and royalties to be paid over a year period assuming approval and us launch in the timeframe using probability of success adjusted scenarios and a discount rate of 
based on current information  management believes that the projections underlying the analysis are reasonable  however  the actual cash inflows or outflows cannot be predicted with certainty 
as with all biotechnology products  the probability of commercial success for any one research and development project is highly uncertain 
if we fail to successfully complete the clinical trials or if caiv t is not approved by the fda as a safe and effective vaccine for our targeted populations  the launch may be delayed or terminated  resulting in a diminished or no return on the purchase price and development costs incurred to date 
in addition  as of december   caiv t has not been manufactured on a sustained commercial scale 
there can be no assurance that commercial scale production could be achieved or sustained 
if we fail to obtain fda approval for the marketing and manufacture of caiv t  we will not achieve the currently anticipated return on any investment we have made or will make in caiv t 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we receive royalties from licensees  based on third party sales of licensed products or technologies 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product is recognized ratably over the development or supply period 
we may record deferred revenues related to milestone payments and other upfront payments 
deferred revenue for manufacturing obligations is recognized as product is delivered 
deferred revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements  as long as the milestones are substantive and at risk 
revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
inventory we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to permanently write down previously capitalized costs related to pre approval or pre launch inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential factors 
conversely  our gross margins may be favorably impacted if some or all of the inventory previously written down becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with marketed products based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to permanently write down previously capitalized costs related to commercial inventory due to quality issues or other potential factors 
conversely  our gross margins may be favorably impacted if some or all of the inventory previously written down is recovered through further processing or receipt of specification waiver from regulatory agencies  and becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
we are required to state all inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to multiple factors affecting our inventories and compare these with current or committed inventory levels 
in the highly regulated industry in which we operate  raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories have expiration dates that must be factored into our judgments about the recoverability of inventory costs 
additionally  if our estimate of a product s pricing is such that we may not fully recover the cost of inventory  we must consider that in our judgments as well 
in order to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market  we will record permanent inventory write downs as soon as determined  such write downs are permanent in nature and will not be reversed in future periods 
the valuation of flumist inventories requires a significant amount of judgment for multiple reasons 
specifically  the manufacturing process is complex  in part due to the required annual update of the formulation for recommended influenza strains  and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue to successfully manufacture the product 
the annual flumist production cycle begins in october of the year prior to the influenza season in which the product will be available for consumption 
for example  the production cycle for the season began in october the production cycle begins by preparing the master viral working seeds and preparing the manufacturing facilities for the bulk monovalent production 
the next part of the process includes blending three monovalent strains into a trivalent vaccine  filling into intranasal sprayers  packaging sprayers into multi dose packs and distributing the frozen product 
our raw materials have expiration dates dates by which they must be used in the production process that range from months to months 
our semi processed raw materials and work in process inventory have multiple components  each having different expiration dates that range from nine to months 
raw materials  semi processed raw materials  work in process inventory and semi finished goods may be carried over to succeeding production seasons under certain conditions 
each season s finished flumist product has an approved shelf life up to six months and therefore may not be sold in a subsequent season 
thus  if our actual sales fall below our projections  we will be required to write off any remaining inventory balance at the end of the flu season 
for all flumist inventory components on hand as of december   we reviewed the following assumptions to determine the amount of any necessary reserves expected production levels and estimated cost per dose  sales volume projections that are subject to variability  the expected price to be received for the product and anticipated distribution costs  utilization of semi finished goods inventory for the succeeding production season  and current information about the influenza strains recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention for the upcoming season s vaccine 
the methodology used to calculate adjustments required to value our flumist inventories as of december  at net realizable value was consistent with the methodology used for the valuations since product approval in june the valuation of flumist inventory as of december  is based on our sales volume estimate of approximately million doses for the season 
after completion of the fourth quarter of  we determined that our flumist sales for the season would fall short of our previous projections by approximately million doses 
as such  we recorded additional reserves of approximately million to reflect total finished goods inventories for the season at estimated realizable value 
also during the fourth quarter of  we recorded permanent inventory writedowns totaling million to reflect certain semi finished goods flumist inventory at net realizable value that we believe will not be useable for the production season 
the table below summarizes the activity within the components of flumist inventories in millions gross net inventory reserves inventory flumist details as of december  raw materials  net cost of goods sold recognized on inventory cost of goods sold recognized on inventory production  net disposals and scrap as of december  for our other products  we periodically assess our inventory balances to determine whether estimated net realizable value is below recorded cost 
factors we consider include expected sales volume  production capacity  quality standards and expiration dates 
during  we recorded permanent inventory write downs of million for certain synagis lots that were determined to be nonsaleable as they were outside of normal specifications and not recoverable 
no other significant inventory adjustments were recorded during sales allowances and other sales related estimates reductions to gross product sales we record allowances for discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates to commercial entities as well as rebates due to government entities as reductions to gross product sales 
the timing of actual discounts  returns  and chargebacks taken  and rebates paid can lag the sale of the product by a number of months 
as such  a significant amount of judgment is required when estimating the impact of sales allowances on gross sales for a reporting period 
the assumptions used in developing our estimates of sales allowances include the following key factors historical trends for discounts  returns  rebate claims  or other claims  our contracts with customers and discount programs  actual performance of customers against contractual discounts tied to volume and compliance targets  proportion of gross sales ultimately used by medicaid patients  state medicaid policies and reimbursement practices  and accuracy of reporting by our customers of end user product sales by state 
we update these factors for any material changes in facts or circumstances as soon as the changes are known 
we estimate the amount of rebates due to government entities quarterly based on historical experience  along with updates  and based on our best estimate of the proportion of sales that will be subject to this reimbursement  largely comprised of medicaid payments to state governments 
during the fourth quarter of  we successfully transitioned to the liquid formulation of synagis in the us from the lyophilized form 
the liquid formulation is treated as a new product for purposes of medicaid rebates 
accordingly  we expect the unit rebate amount for liquid synagis to be lower than the unit rebate amount for the lyophilized formulation  resulting in a reduction in allowances for government rebates and an increase in net realized price 
during the fourth quarter of  we became aware of efforts by several states to collect rebates for product administered in certain settings for which reimbursement was not sought in the past 
after analyzing the situation  we determined that the new facts and circumstances warranted an increase in our estimate of rebates due to government purchasers 
as such  we recorded additional reserves for past rebates due to government purchasers and increased our estimate of the proportion of current sales that will be subject to reimbursement  given the change in circumstance 
estimation of the probable amount that will be owed to such states requires considerable judgment  and it is possible that the amount ultimately paid could differ significantly from amounts accrued 
as of december  and  allowances for government rebates in those states for which reimbursement has not been sought in the past totaled million and million  respectively 
the company will continue to assess the probability of such rebate assessments  based upon current facts and circumstances 
for the years ended december   and  allowances for discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates due to government purchasers resulted in a net reduction to gross product sales of approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in and is attributable to higher levels of medicaid reporting compliance for reimbursement and increased discounting  as well as the the impact of flumist sales  which experience higher discount and return rates than our other products 
allowances for discounts  returns  and chargebacks  which are netted against accounts receivable  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
allowances for government reimbursements were million as of december  and and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
if our historical trends are not indicative of the future  or our actual sales are materially different from the projected amounts  or if our assessments prove to be materially different than actual occurrence  our results could be affected 
the estimation process for determining reserves for sales allowances inherently results in adjustments each year 
additionally  because of the varying lags and the seasonal nature of our largest product  synagis  our sales discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates fluctuate throughout the year 
if our estimate of the percentage of gross sales to be recorded for sales allowances for synagis were to increase by  our net product sales for the synagis sales season which runs from july to june would have been reduced by approximately million 
a decrease of in the sales allowances for synagis during the same period would have increased our revenues by approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses we estimate our co promotion expense and sales commissions by applying an estimated rate that is based upon an estimate of projected sales for the season to our actual sales for the period 
as discussed earlier  in august  we amended our co promotion agreement with abbott for sales of synagis in the united states 
the value of the co promotion services to be rendered by abbott through june the remaining co promotion period  as determined under the previous agreement  will be recorded as co promotion expense within selling  general and administrative expense 
the incremental payments to be made as a result of the amended terms of the agreement in excess of the value of the co promotion services to be rendered have been recorded as an intangible asset 
we estimate the level of bad debts by applying a percentage to gross trade accounts receivable balances outstanding at the end of the period  based upon our assessment of the concentration of credit risk  the financial condition and environment of our customers  and any specifically identified doubtful accounts 
because of the seasonal nature of our largest product  synagis  our accounts receivable balances fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  our allowance for doubtful accounts also fluctuates 
our accounts receivable balances tend to be highest at the end of december and march  while the september balances are somewhat lower as our selling season is just beginning  and the june balances are significantly lower  reflecting the close out of the prior season 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in reductions to the allowance  largely based on changes in our assessment of credit risk 
no significant adjustments to the allowance were recorded during bad debt expense is classified as selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are anticipated to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in general  should we determine that we are able to realize more than the recorded amounts of net deferred tax assets in the future  our net income will increase in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  our net income would decrease in the period such determination was made 
reversals of valuation allowance related to acquired deferred tax assets  however  would first be applied against goodwill and other intangibles before impacting net income 
a tax reserve is recorded when we cannot assert that it is probable that a tax position claimed on a return will be sustained upon challenge by the tax authority 
any change in the balance of a tax reserve during the year is treated as an adjustment to current year tax expense 
the recognition of income by our uk subsidiary and certain prior year true ups of deferred tax assets of this subsidiary enabled us to release valuation allowances in and of million and million  respectively  resulting in a favorable impact to the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  in and we increased valuation allowances by million and million  respectively  related predominantly to state net operating losses and state research and development credits generated during those periods  as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that wewill generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions to utilize the attributes 
during  we established additional tax contingency reserves of million related to various state matters resulting in additional tax expense 
during  we reached a state tax settlement that enabled us to release a tax contingency reserve of million  resulting in a benefit to our consolidated statement of operations 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we made corrections to the previous accounting for deferred tax assets  goodwill  paid in capital and tax expense 
the corrections related to reporting periods dating back to the acquisition of aviron  a california based vaccine company  in january the acquisition 
the corrections resulted in additional tax expense of approximately million for the full year goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded and valued significant acquired intangible assets 
as of december   the unamortized carrying amount of our intangible assets is million 
we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during  we recorded an intangible asset in connection with our reacquisition of the co promotion rights for synagis in the united states 
the value assigned to the intangible asset of million represents the estimated fair value of the exclusive promotion rights  determined as the aggregate present value of the probable incremental payments to be made as a result of the amended terms of the agreement in excess of the value of the co promotion services to be rendered  as determined under the previous agreement 
the intangible asset will be amortized ratably over future sales of synagis over the expected period of active sales and marketing in the us  which are projected to continue through the first half of  as we expect to launch numax during the rsv season 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded million of acquired intangible assets 
we engaged independent valuation experts who reviewed our critical assumptions and assisted us in determining a value for the identifiable intangibles 
of the million of acquired intangible assets  million was assigned to the worldwide collaborative agreement with wyeth for the development  manufacture  distribution  marketing  promotion  and sale of flumist 
we estimated the fair value of the wyeth agreement using the sum of the probability adjusted scenarios under the income approach 
in applying this method  we relied on revenue assumptions  profitability assumptions and anticipated approval dates 
the remaining million was assigned to a contract manufacturing agreement with evans vaccines limited 
we estimated the fair value of the evans agreement using the cost approach  which is based on the theory that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset than the amount for which the asset could be replaced 
in our analysis  we reduced replacement cost for such factors as physical deterioration and functional or economic obsolescence 
as a result of the dissolution of the collaboration with wyeth during  we recorded a permanent impairment loss of million that represented the remaining unamortized cost of the related intangible asset 
during  we made adjustments to goodwill totaling million  of which million resulted from the correction to certain prior period purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition  and million resulted from current year purchase accounting adjustments  as discussed in the income tax section above and more fully detailed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 
during and  we made adjustments to goodwill recorded in the acquisition of million and million  respectively  reflecting adjustments to deferred tax assets relating to the resolution of income tax related uncertainties 
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and during interim periods if an event that could result in an impairment occurs 
as of december   we have not identified any impairment of goodwill  million of goodwill remains on the consolidated balance sheet 
investments in debt and equity securities our short term and long term investments are subject to adjustment for other than temporary impairments 
impairment charges are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when a decline in the fair value of an investment falls below its cost value and is judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment charge is required  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the issuer  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
during  and  we recorded impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  based on the duration and magnitude of the declines in the fair value of certain of our investments  as well as the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee companies 
results of operations comparison of to revenues product sales in millions change synagis domestic international ethyol domestic international flumist other products total product sales synagis synagis accounted for approximately and of our product sales for and  respectively 
we achieved a increase in domestic synagis sales to million for  up from million in the growth over the prior year period resulted from a increase in the domestic sales price along with a increase in unit sales volume 
while sales of synagis finished strong for the last half of the rsv season  the rsv season started slower than expected due primarily to changes in payer guidelines that led to delays of when many patients received their first dose of synagis  the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita on certain sales territories  and an early disruption in the product s distribution network caused by the departure of a large distributor prior to the season 
in addition  sales patterns in the fourth quarter of were affected by conversion of the us supply from the lyophilized formulation to the new liquid formulation of synagis  which primarily occurred during the month of november 
our reported international sales of synagis increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to continued demand growth in several key international markets and the timing of stocking patterns for the season  partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact of a strengthened us dollar 
during  the label for synagis was expanded in japan to include children with congenital heart disease 
ethyol ethyol accounted for approximately of our product sales for and worldwide ethyol sales increased slightly to million in  as compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in the domestic sales price along with modest growth in international sales volumes for flumist flumist accounted for approximately and of our product sales for and  respectively 
sales of flumist were million in  as compared to million in  a decrease primarily due to lower unit sales volumes and the timing of revenue recognition for product shipped during our sales of flumist are comprised of million doses sold during the first quarter of as the influenza season came to an end and million doses sold during the second half of related to the influenza season 
our sales of flumist of million consisted of product sales for the flu season of million  representing estimated net doses of approximately million  as well as million of transfer price for product shipped to wyeth during for the influenza season 
at december   the variables associated with flumist product revenues were not determinable  largely due to low sales volume and the lack of returns history and comparable rebate redemption rates for the new product 
as a result  product revenues associated with the doses that were shipped to wyeth in were not recognized until the first quarter of other products sales of other products include sales of cytogam  neutrexin  and by products that result from the cytogam manufacturing process  as well as sales of respigam in  and amounted to million in as compared to million for the increase is primarily due to a increase in sales of cytogam 
we are in the process of transferring cytogam manufacturing responsibilities to different contract manufacturers  a process which is expected to be completed during the second half of until the transfer is complete and the new manufacturing sites are approved by the fda  we expect supply to be limited and that sales will be adversely affected 
revenues other revenues other revenues increased to million for compared to million for other revenues in include million of revenue related to the amended terms of our international distribution agreement with ai  which represents amounts received in excess of the estimated fair value for product sales of synagis  as explained in note  collaborative arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 
other revenues in are largely comprised of contractual payments received from wyeth prior to dissolution of our collaboration  including royalties related to the influenza season and corporate funding for clinical development and sales and marketing programs 
other revenues in also include million of milestone revenue recognized under our international distribution agreement with ai upon the achievement of end user sales of synagis outside the us in excess of million in a single rsv season 
cost of sales cost of sales for decreased to million from million for gross margins on product sales were for  up five percentage points from gross margins of for gross margins for all products  excluding flumist  improved to in from in  primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and the million recoupment of past royalty overpayments that was recognized as a reduction to cost of sales during the third quarter of the impact of flumist reduced overall gross margins in and by four percentage points and eight percentage points  respectively 
flumist exerted less of a negative impact on gross margins for due primarily to focused efforts to gain manufacturing efficiencies and improved net revenue estimates for the influenza season see further discussion of inventory in the critical accounting estimates section of this management s discussion and analysis 
research and development expenses research and development expenses of million in increased from million in research and development expenses  as reported in the accompanying statements of operations  included both our ongoing expenses of drug discovery and development efforts  as well as costs related to the technology transfer and transition activities associated with reacquisition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth during the increase is due largely to direct costs associated with ongoing and additional clinical and preclinical trials for product candidates  increases in headcount and related expenses in support of increased research and development activities and upfront licensing fees and milestone payments related to in licensing agreements and research collaborations 
upfront fees and milestones incurred in connection with research collaborations and in licensing agreements were million in versus million in also included in research and development expenses in and are million and million  respectively  in costs for technology transfer and transition activities associated with our assumption of research and development activities related to the influenza vaccines franchise 
research and development expenses in were of product sales versus of product sales in  reflecting the continuing investment to bring new products to market as part of our long range plan 
we have several programs in clinical and pre clinical development  and a summary of our more significant current internal research and development efforts is as follows product stage of candidates description development caiv t refrigerator stable version of intranasal influenza vaccine  live phase numax second generation monoclonal antibody for prevention of rsv phase vitaxin monoclonal antibody for the treatment of melanoma and prostate cancer phase ethyol subcutaneous administration in non small cell lung cancer patients reduction of esophogitis and pneumonitis phase selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase is largely attributable to increased co promotion expense  corresponding to the increase in domestic synagis sales  and the continued expansion of the pediatric commercial organization 
co promotion expense was million in and million in also included in sg a expense in is amortization expense of million associated with the intangible asset for us co promotion rights for synagis that was acquired and recorded during the third quarter of as a percentage of product sales  sg a expense increased to of product sales for compared to of product sales in impairment of intangible asset as a result of entering into agreements to dissolve the collaboration with wyeth during april  we recorded a permanent impairment loss of million that represented the remaining unamortized cost originally recorded for the collaboration with wyeth 
acquired ipr d we recorded charges for acquired ipr d of million in in conjunction with the acquisition of the outstanding equity interests in cellective 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets  and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values  with a portion allocated to the estimated value of acquired ipr d 
during and  we also recorded charges for acquired ipr d of million and million  respectively  in conjunction with our reacquisition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth 
the charges represent the estimated relative fair value of purchased in process technologies and research and development projects  primarily caiv t at the acquisition date  including the impact of subsequent milestone payments  calculated utilizing the income approach 
see further discussion of ipr d in the critical accounting estimates section of this management s discussion and analysis 
loss on investment activities we recorded a net loss on investment activities of million during  compared to a net loss of million during the net loss consists primarily of impairment write downs due to the decline in fair value of certain of our investments in private companies below their cost basis that were determined to be other than temporary 
the net loss consists of impairment write downs of million which are partially offset by realized gains on sales of common stock and other investments totaling million 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for compared to an income tax benefit of million for income tax expense in was affected by the non deductible acquired ipr d charge of million related to the acquisition of cellective as well as by million relating to corrections made in the second half of to the prior accounting for income taxes  as more fully discussed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 
the corrections were comprised of amounts related to reporting periods dating back to the acquisition of aviron in january excluding both the acquired ipr d charge and the effect of the corrections  the effective tax rate for was approximately 
comparatively  the effective tax rate for was  excluding the impact of the termination of the wyeth agreements  including approximately million of non deductible charges for acquired ipr d incurred during the second quarter of the increase in the effective rate  excluding non deductible charges  in is attributed to the lower level of pre tax book income that amplifies the impact of certain nondeductible items  a decrease in the r d tax credits available and higher state taxes 
net earnings we reported a net loss for of million  or per share compared to a net loss for of million  or per share 
shares used in computing losses per share for and were million and million  respectively 
we do not believe inflation had a material effect on our financial statements 
comparison of to revenues product sales in millions change synagis domestic international ethyol domestic international flumist n a other products total product sales during  product sales grew to billion as compared to billion during  primarily due to an increase in sales of synagis to million 
of the overall increase in product sales  approximately five percentage points were due to the recognition of flumist product sales for the first time in domestic price increases accounted for five growth points  and an additional two percentage points were due to increases in domestic sales volume  but were largely negated by higher sales allowances that reduced sales by two percentage points 
international sales added three points of growth 
synagis synagis accounted for approximately and of our product sales for and  respectively 
we achieved a increase in domestic synagis sales to million for  up from million in of the growth year over year  five percentage points resulted from price increases and four percentage points were due to higher sales volumes  which were partially offset by higher sales allowances that caused a reduction of two percentage points 
our reported international sales of synagis increased to million in compared to million in  largely due to a increase in units sold to abbott international ai  our exclusive distributor of synagis outside of the united states 
we believe this growth was primarily due to increased product demand by our end users  including physicians  hospitals  and pharmacies 
also contributing to international sales growth was an increase in the sales price caused by a change in the mix of countries to which we sell synagis internationally that favorably impacted the average sales price  and the favorable currency translation impact of a weakened us dollar 
ethyol ethyol accounted for approximately and of our product sales for and  respectively 
worldwide ethyol sales declined to million in  as compared to million in domestic sales of ethyol declined from prior year  driven by an eight percentage point decline due to volume and an additional four points due to an increase in sales allowances  offset by six growth points due to price increases 
we believe that the lower domestic sales volumes for were largely due to the depletion of wholesaler inventories from december  levels to accommodate end user demand and the impact  which we believe was temporary  of the adoption of a relatively new form of radiation treatment in the head and neck cancer market 
international sales of ethyol declined over the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in unit volume to our international distribution partner  schering 
flumist our product sales of flumist amounted to million  including product sales for the flu season of million  representing estimated net doses of approximately million 
sales also included transfer price revenues of million for product shipped to wyeth  our former partner  during related to the season 
at december   we concluded that the variables associated with flumist product revenues were not determinable  largely due to low sales volume and the lack of returns history and comparable rebate redemption rates for the new product 
as a result  no product revenues were recognized during associated with the million doses that were shipped to wyeth during other products sales of other products included sales of cytogam  respigam  neutrexin and by products that result from the cytogam manufacturing process and amounted to million in as compared to million in the slight decrease was primarily due to the decline in sales of respigam  which has been replaced in the marketplace by our second generation rsv product  synagis  and is no longer manufactured 
revenues other revenues other revenues of million for were lower than other revenues of million largely due to decreased revenues under collaborative agreements 
during  we recognized million of milestone revenue under our international distribution agreement with ai upon the achievement of end user sales of synagis outside the us in excess of million in a single rsv season 
other revenues in also included contractual payments received from wyeth prior to dissolution of our collaboration  including royalties related to the influenza season  supply goal payments  and corporate funding for clinical development and sales and marketing programs 
during  we recognized million of revenues under the collaboration with wyeth related to milestone payments  supply goal payments  and funding for clinical development and marketing programs 
also during  we recognized million of milestone revenue for achieving in excess of million in end user sales of synagis outside the us during a single rsv season 
cost of sales cost of sales for increased to million from million for gross margins on product sales were for  down four percentage points from gross margins of for gross margins for all products  excluding flumist  aggregated to of product sales for both and the negative impact of flumist on gross margins was less in than largely due to the shift in costs of flumist manufacturing that were included in inventory and cost of goods sold during  but were expensed as other operating costs during the first quarter of  prior to fda approval of the product 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses more than doubled during to million from million in research and development expenses  as reported in the accompanying statements of operations  included both our ongoing expenses of drug discovery and development efforts  as well as costs related to the technology transfer and transition activities associated with reacquisition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth during the technology transfer and transition costs  totaling approximately million  were largely amounts paid to wyeth for collection and analysis of data from five late stage caiv t studies conducted by wyeth over the last several years  including assistance in documenting study reports  closing and locking databases for clinical trials  and transition of clinical study results to our clinical databases 
the costs also included payments for the maintenance of the caiv t development facility and production of caiv t clinical trial material  as well as assistance with internal technology transfer of manufacturing operations for caiv t 
the increase in our ongoing expenses of drug discovery and development efforts was related to a large number of new and ongoing clinical and preclinical studies  particularly for numax  caiv t and vitaxin  as well as costs associated with the expansion of infrastructure to support these studies 
during november  we advanced the numax program into phase clinical trials  with a pivotal head to head trial with synagis  and a second trial designed to assess whether numax can reduce the incidence of rsv hospitalization in native american infants 
we were also completing a phase trial with numax 
during october  we initiated a phase trial to compare caiv t to the traditional injectible flu vaccine in children from months to months of age  and a phase bridging study designed to compare caiv t with frozen flumist 
we also progressed with two ongoing phase trials for vitaxin targeting melanoma and prostate cancer  while we discontinued two trials for vitaxin targeting rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis based on preliminary data suggesting lack of clinical benefit in these inflammatory diseases 
also during  we began a phase clinical trial with an anti interleukin il monoclonal antibody to evaluate the molecule as a potential treatment for symptomatic  moderate to severe persistent asthma 
during  we also made a million payment to medarex  inc as part of a new collaboration to co develop antibodies targeting interferon alpha and the type interferon receptor for the treatment of autoimmune diseases 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase was largely attributable to costs associated with expanding the pediatric commercial organization  increased co promotion expense  and increased marketing activities and professional services 
co promotion expense was million in and million in excluding the amounts incurred during for wyeth related transition activities and the favorable impact in both years of adjustments to the bad debt provision based upon changes in our assessment of credit risk  sg a expense as a percentage of product sales was and in and  respectively 
other operating expenses other operating expenses  which reflect manufacturing start up costs and other manufacturing related costs  decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to the shift in the costs of flumist manufacturing that were in inventory and cost of goods sold in  but were expensed as other operating costs in prior to the june approval of flumist 
other operating expenses in both periods also included excess capacity charges associated with the plasma production portion of the frederick manufacturing center 
impairment of intangible asset as a result of entering into agreements to dissolve the collaboration with wyeth during april  we recorded a permanent impairment loss of million that represented the remaining unamortized cost originally recorded for the original collaboration with wyeth 
acquired ipr d we recorded a charge of million for acquired ipr d for in conjunction with our reacquisition of the influenza vaccines franchise from wyeth 
the charge represented the relative fair value of purchased in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the income approach  of certain ipr d projects  primarily caiv t 
see further discussion of ipr d in the critical accounting estimates section of this management s discussion and analysis 
interest income and expense we earned interest income of million for  compared to million in  reflecting higher average investment balances and higher average rates 
interest expense for  net of amounts capitalized  was million  down from million in the decline was due to the retirement of the convertible subordinated notes in march  partially offset by a decrease in the amount of interest cost capitalized in versus the prior period  due to the completion of several large construction projects in  including the new r d facility and corporate headquarters in maryland 
gain loss on investment activities we incurred a million loss on investment activities for  compared to a gain of million in the loss consisted of impairment write downs of million due to the decline in fair value of certain of our investments in private companies below their cost basis that were determined to be other than temporary  partially offset by net realized gains on sales of common stock and other investments totaling million 
during  we recognized gains on the sale of common stock and other investments of million  partially offset by impairment write downs and charges to record our portion of our minority investees operating results as required by the equity method of accounting 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
comparatively  we recorded income tax expense of million for  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the year over year change in our estimated effective tax rate was due in part to million of non deductible charges for acquired ipr d during the second quarter of our effective tax rate in was also favorably impacted by the increase in credits available for research and development activities  including credits earned for orphan drug status of certain research and experimentation activities  corresponding to the overall growth in research and experimentation activity over these credits will vary from year to year depending on our activities and the enactment of tax legislation 
also during  we reached a state tax settlement and our uk subsidiary recognized income for uk tax purposes  enabling us to release valuation allowance and tax contingency reserves  resulting in a favorable impact to the consolidated statement of operations 
net earnings loss we reported a net loss for of million  or per share compared to net earnings for of million or per diluted share 
shares used in computing loss per share for were million  while shares used for computing basic and diluted earnings per share for were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the share count was primarily attributable to our stock repurchase program that we implemented in july we do not believe inflation had a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our capital requirements have been funded from cash provided by operations  cash and investments on hand  proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the issuance of convertible debt 
cash and marketable securities were billion at december  as compared to billion at december   a decrease of million 
this decrease in cash and marketable securities is primarily due to the payment made to acquire the outstanding equity interests in cellective  payments made to abbott in conjunction with the reacquisition of the co promotion rights for synagis in the us  upfront fees and milestone payments under licensing agreements and research collaborations as well as share repurchases 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the reclassification of our convertible senior notes to current liabilities  as the holders may require us to purchase the notes for cash in july  as provided for in the indenture 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was approximately higher than the prior year primarily due to timing of the conversion from the lyophilized formulation of synagis to the new liquid formulation 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million during as compared to million in  primarily the result of the decrease in in net earnings  excluding the charges for acquired ipr d and the impairment of an intangible asset  reflecting higher levels of spending for research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in versus investing activities cash used for investing activities during was million  as compared to million in cash used for investing activities in included net reductions to our investment portfolio of million  the payment of million to acquire the outstanding equity interests in cellective  net of cash acquired  incremental payments to abbott of million in conjunction with the amendment of the us co promotion agreement for synagis  capital expenditures totaling million  primarily for the construction of our new pilot lab in gaithersburg  maryland  and the expansion of our influenza vaccine manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom  and minority interest investments in portfolio companies totaling million through our venture capital subsidiary 
financing activities financing activities in used million in cash  as compared to million in during  we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock as authorized under our share repurchase program compared to million in and million in approximately million was received upon the issuance of common stock relating primarily to the exercise of employee stock options in compared to million received in and million received in during  we used million in cash to repurchase and retire the balance of the notes 
during  we received net cash proceeds of million in connection with the issuance of the notes 
our primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow 
management believes that such internally generated cash flow as well as existing funds and financing available to us will be adequate to service our existing debt and other cash requirements 
we expend cash to finance our research and development and clinical trial programs  to obtain access to new technologies through collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners  through our venture capital subsidiary  or through other means  to fund capital projects  and to finance the production of inventories 
we currently anticipate that the holders of our convertible senior notes will require us to redeem the notes for cash in july as provided for under the indenture 
we believe that our cash and marketable securities on hand will be adequate to service the cash requirements 
however  we anticipate using a line of credit or other type of credit instrument to repay at least a portion of these notes 
the bbb rating on our outstanding indebtedness  considered to be investment grade  will contribute to our ability to access capital markets  should we desire or need to do so 
in february  our board of directors approved an additional million in funding for our venture capital subsidiary  bringing the total amount allocated to million 
we may raise additional capital in the future to take advantage of favorable conditions in the market or in connection with our development activities 
during the second quarter of  we recouped approximately million from licensors related to overpayments under various royalty agreements 
during the third quarter of  we recognized million of this royalty recoupment as a reduction to cost of goods sold after determining that related contingencies had been resolved 
the remaining amount of million has been deferred until fully realizable and therefore is recorded in other current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock during the period from july through june in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  pursuant to terms management deems appropriate and at such times it may designate 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program at a total cost of million  or an average cost of per share 
during  we repurchased million shares at a total cost of million  or an average cost of per share 
as of february   approximately million remained available under the authorization for additional repurchases of stock 
we are holding repurchased shares as treasury shares and are using them for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to acquisition related transactions and for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
in  we will continue construction of the pilot plant located at the headquarters site in gaithersburg  maryland  which is expected to be fully operational by november  as well as additional administrative offices  which are expected to be completed in september we also expect to break ground on a new cell culture manufacturing facility in march  located adjacent to our existing biologics facility in frederick  maryland  which we plan to use as a manufacturing site for potential new monoclonal antibody products that emerge from our pipeline  including numax 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate million in we anticipate these projects will be funded from cash generated from operations  investments on hand  and the proceeds from a line of credit or other type of credit instrument 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  that we anticipate will require significant cash outlays in the future in millions contractual obligations total beyond long term debt facilities leases purchase obligations obligations to abbott obligations to evans total contractual obligations other commercial commitments standby letters of credit other contractual commitments total other commercial commitments we currently anticipate that the holders of our convertible senior notes will require us to redeem the notes for cash in july as provided for under the indenture 
accordingly  the notes have been classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the company is contingently committed to precision pharma services for fractionation services and bulk production through  pending fda approval of the manufacture of bulk product by precision pharma 
the amounts exclude this contingent commitment of approximately million 
represents the present value of the probable incremental payments to be made to abbott as a result of the amended terms of the co promotion agreement in excess of the value of the co promotion services to be rendered  as determined under the original agreement 
represents amounts due to evans vaccines limited pursuant to a manufacturing arrangement 
we have guaranteed performance under certain agreements related to our construction projects 
the undiscounted maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under such guarantees  in the aggregate  is approximately million 
we have entered into a number of research and development collaborations  in licensing agreements and other contractual arrangements to gain access to new product candidates and technologies  to further develop our products and technology  and to perform clinical trials 
the amounts indicated as commitments under these agreements represent committed funding obligations under these agreements 
the amounts exclude contingent commitments for development milestone payments as well as sales related milestone payments and royalties relating to potential future product sales under these agreements 
these potential payments have been excluded since the amount  timing and likelihood of these payments is unknown as they are dependent on the occurrence of future events that may or may not occur  such as the granting by the fda of a license for product marketing in the united states 
if all contractual development milestones were to be achieved under these agreements  which we do not consider probable  the total development milestone payments would approximate billion 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that meet the definition of off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
our primary market risks as of december  are our exposures to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
marketable securities as of december   our excess cash balances are primarily invested in marketable debt securities with investment grade credit ratings 
substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in custody by three major us financial institutions 
deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and  therefore  bear minimal risk 
our investments consist principally of us government and agency securities and corporate notes and bonds 
the maturities range from one month to seven years 
our investment guidelines are intended to limit the amount of investment exposure as to issuer  maturity  and investment type 
the fair value of these investments is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
further  interest income earned on variable rate debt securities is exposed to changes in the general level of interest rates

medimmune ventures  inc  our wholly owned venture capital subsidiary  manages our current portfolio of minority interest investments and endeavors to make investments in public or private biotechnology companies focused on discovering and developing human therapeutics 
our board of directors has approved funding to medimmune ventures for up to million in investments  of which million has been invested as of february  medimmune ventures will invest primarily in areas of strategic interest to medimmune  including infectious disease  immunology and oncology 
the cost basis of medimmune ventures investment holdings  net of impairment writedowns  was million as of december  our minority interest investments are subject to adjustment for other than temporary impairments 
we recognize impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations when a decline in the fair value of an investment falls below its cost value and is judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the investee  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
during  and  we recorded impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  based on the duration and magnitude of the declines in fair value  as well as the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee companies 
we expect the volatility in the fair value of our minority investments to continue and  thus  the value assigned to the investments could change significantly from period to period 
as of december   medimmune ventures portfolio included approximately million shares of common stock of two publicly traded companies with a cost basis of million and fair value of million 
the remainder of medimmune ventures portfolio as of december  consists primarily of minority interest investments in privately held biotechnology companies 
the investments are maintained on the cost or equity method of accounting  according to the facts and circumstances of the individual investment 
for investments carried on the equity method  we record our proportionate share of the investees gains or losses on a quarterly basis  which was immaterial during  and as of december   the investments in privately held companies had a cost basis of million  net of permanent writedowns
