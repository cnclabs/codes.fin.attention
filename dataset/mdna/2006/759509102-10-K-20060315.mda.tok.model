table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  we generated higher revenues  profits and cash flows than our company has ever experienced 
we had not expected to beat our results  as the year was unlike any other that we had seen for the metals service center industry  with most metals service center companies generating record financial results in in  we experienced unprecedented high prices that increased rapidly for most carbon steel products  with improved demand from our customers 
however  our results were even stronger than our results due to our diverse product mix  along with healthy pricing and improved demand for most products that we sell  especially for products sold to the aerospace market 
demand for most of our products improved in from levels  especially in the second half of demand for aerospace products increased significantly throughout and demand for non residential construction products improved substantially in the second half of we expect demand for most products to remain strong in pricing for carbon steel products increased significantly and rapidly in this resulted mainly from supply limitations due to shortages of raw materials at the mill level because of increased global demand for these raw materials  due to lower domestic capacity as some mill capacity was shut down during and  and due to reduced quantities of import material entering the united states because of higher pricing levels in other parts of the world  especially china 
in  carbon steel costs declined during the first eight months of the year  then increased in the fourth quarter of we believe the pricing pressure in the beginning of the year was related to a surplus of metal in the supply chain 
however  costs for carbon steel products remain at high levels compared to historical levels  and the average cost for the year was higher than for the year 
aluminum and stainless steel costs increased consistently during most of due to improved demand and some supply limitations  and continued to increase somewhat in aluminum  stainless steel and titanium products used by the aerospace industry are in tight supply and prices for these products increased significantly and rapidly throughout because of the overall healthy demand in  we were typically able to increase our selling prices for most products at a rate equal to or above our cost increases 
however  pressures on carbon steel costs and pricing during the first eight months of the year resulted in reduced gross profit margins for these products during that time 
the strong demand and tight supply of aerospace products allowed us to increase our selling prices for these products prior to receiving the higher cost metal into our inventory increasing our gross profit margins 
our gross profit margins were very healthy 
we are proud of our record financial results that highlighted the importance of our product diversity and the efforts of our managers 
in addition to profitability  we focus on working capital management which allows us to generate cash flow to further expand and strengthen our business and reduce debt during most environments 
our cash flow from operations was our highest ever  reflecting the quality of our earnings 
we completed one acquisition in  grew our existing operations  and continued to evaluate opportunities that would allow us to improve our profitability 
in january  we reached an agreement to acquire earle m 
jorgensen company  our largest acquisition to date and our first public company acquisition  which we expect to complete during the second quarter  pending approval of the emj stockholders 
we also identified opportunities to expand our existing operations and took actions to allow for this profitable future growth 
we believe the steps that we took during the difficult years of through positioned us to take full advantage of the improved economic conditions we experienced in and however  as evidenced by our performance during the difficult years  we take the necessary actions to allow us to operate efficiently and profitably even in less favorable economies 
we believe this is because of our focus on cost controls and inventory turnover and our product  customer and geographic diversification 
our product and geographic diversification should continue to benefit us in we are optimistic about business conditions in significant declines in demand or pricing for our products  although not expected  could reduce our gross profit margins 
also  if we cannot obtain a sufficient supply of metals for our customers in  or if domestic availability of our products increases significantly in  this could negatively impact our financial results  especially as compared to our results 
customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases  our revenue dollars increase  which contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 

table of contents pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increases 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure  the impact on our results of operations is much greater than the effect of volume changes 
also  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this could increase our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we can typically generate strong levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease 
recent developments in we completed one acquisition and formed a joint venture company to allow us to expand into china 
in the first quarter of  we have acquired the remaining interest in our owned company  reached an agreement for our largest acquisition to date  announced an agreement to purchase the assets and business of a toll processing company  and acquired our first company in china through the joint venture company we formed in we also opened facilities in new geographic areas  expanded existing facilities and purchased certain facilities that we previously leased 
on july   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of chapel steel corp  headquartered in spring house philadelphia  pennsylvania 
we paid approximately million in cash for the equity of chapel steel and assumed approximately million of chapel steel s debt 
chapel steel was a privately held metals service center company founded in that processes and distributes carbon and alloy steel plate products from five facilities in pottstown philadelphia  pennsylvania  bourbonnais chicago  illinois  houston  texas  birmingham  alabama  and portland  oregon 
chapel steel also warehouses and distributes its products in cincinnati  ohio and hamilton  ontario  canada 
chapel steel s net sales for the six months ended december  were approximately million 
chapel steel now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of reliance 
on january   we acquired the remaining of our subsidiary  american steel  llc  that we did not already own 
american steel operates metals service centers in portland  oregon and kent  washington and had net sales of approximately million 
on january   we entered into an agreement to acquire earle m 
jorgensen company emj  a publicly held metals service center company with forty locations in the us and canada and fiscal year ended march  net sales of approximately billion 
if approved by emj s stockholders  we will acquire emj for approximately per emj share  to be paid approximately in cash and in reliance stock  subject to the established minimum and maximum amount of stock to be issued 
we expect to close this transaction in april  if approved by the emj stockholders 
on february   we announced that we have reached an agreement to purchase the assets and business of flat rock metal processing  llc flat rock is a privately held  toll processing company 
our subsidiary  precision strip  will operate the flat rock facilities in perrysburg  ohio and eldridge  iowa 
this transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter 
on march   we acquired everest metals suzhou co  ltd  a metals service center company based near shanghai  china  through our owned joint venture company reliance pan pacific pte  ltd  that we formed in october of everest metals was previously wholly owned by our joint venture partner 
everest metals processes and distributes primarily aluminum products to the electronics industry in china  with net sales of approximately million 
we also entered into a million  five year  unsecured revolving credit facility in june of that replaced our previous million revolving credit facility 
this increased capacity will allow us to continue to grow our business 
if the emj acquisition closes  our current million credit facility will be increased to million  to support the needs of our combined company 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales gross profit s  g a expenses depreciation expense operating profit excludes other income  amortization expense  minority interest  interest expense and income tax expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were a record billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this increase includes the additional sales from chapel steel of million that we acquired in july our increased sales include an increase in our tons sold of and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold of the tons sold and average selling price per ton sold exclude amounts related to precision strip 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of chapel steel  were billion in  up from  with a decrease in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
our volume increased due to the additional sales of chapel steel  however  on a same store basis  our volume is down from mainly because of the heavy buying that occurred in when our customers were trying to build inventory ahead of the significant carbon steel price increases 
because carbon steel prices were declining for most of  our customers were not building inventory until late in the third quarter 
we experienced demand improvement beginning late in the third quarter that continued throughout the fourth quarter 
this was due to improved end markets for most products we sell  with non residential construction and aerospace being significant contributors to the strong end market demand 
our average selling price per ton sold has been higher in than in mainly because of increased costs for most products that we sell and due to a small shift in product mix to a higher percentage of aluminum and stainless steel products as compared to although carbon steel costs declined during the first eight months of  the average cost for the full year remained above the average 
aluminum and stainless steel costs began increasing in and continued to increase throughout  with significant and rapid increases in the costs of aerospace products 
the improved demand for aerospace products resulted in a slight shift in product mix to higher priced products that contributed to our increased average selling prices in gross profit 
our total gross profit of million  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales amount in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in in our gross profit margins declined mainly because of the pressure on our selling prices for carbon steel products resulting from lower costs  especially compared to when we experienced high profitability levels for these products because of limited availability and significant cost increases 
gross profit margins for aerospace related products were higher in because we were able to increase our selling prices ahead of our costs 
the acquisition of chapel steel lowered our gross profit margin somewhat  as their business is more of a wholesale distribution business that operates at a lower gross profit margin than our consolidated average 
our same store gross profit margin was 
also  our lifo expense was significantly lower than in primarily due to decreases in carbon steel costs  with the impact somewhat offset by the rising costs of aerospace products 
we recorded lifo expense  which is included in our cost of sales  of million during  compared to million in most of our lifo expense was due to increased costs for aerospace related aluminum  titanium  and stainless steel products 

table of contents expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased million  or from the expenses as a percent of sales in were compared to in the period 
the dollar increase in s  g a expenses was mostly due to the inclusion of chapel steel beginning in the third quarter  as well as general cost increases 
the decrease in our s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales was due mainly to our increased sales levels and because chapel steel s s  g a expenses are lower than the company s average as a percentage of sales 
depreciation expense increased million in because of the additional expense from chapel steel and expense on our fixed asset additions 
amortization expense increased million in primarily due to the write off of financing costs related to our million syndicated credit facility that we replaced in june of and because of the amortization expense from chapel steel 
operating profit 
operating profit  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating profit of million and an operating profit margin of 
the improvement resulted from our higher sales levels that provided increased operating profit dollars in  along with our healthy gross profit margins and lower s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales  as discussed above 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease was mainly due to lower borrowing levels because of the increased cash flow from operations that we generated in our interest expense includes interest on our borrowings of approximately million to fund the acquisition of chapel steel on july   which we had fully repaid as of december  minority interest expense decreased in compared to mainly because we purchased the remaining interest in valex korea from our partner in july the minority interest expense represents the net income attributed to the of american steel  llc that we did not own 
as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section  we purchased the remaining interest in american steel in january income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in  up from in  mainly due to an increase in our state rate because of shifts in the geographic composition of our income  resulting mainly from our acquisition of chapel steel and the increased profitability from our locations that serve the aerospace market 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this increase includes the additional sales from precision strip that we acquired in july our increased sales include an increase in our tons sold of and an increase in the average selling price per ton sold of 
the increase in our tons sold was mainly due to somewhat improved customer demand in all markets in as compared to levels 
we began to experience higher sales volumes in september that continued through the first nine months of this included a peak in the march period  which we believe was due in part to increased buying by our customers to beat announced mill price increases 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a slight slowdown from earlier in the year  which we believe was mainly due to the typical seasonal slowdown during this period 
the increase in our average selling price per ton sold of resulted mainly from significant increases in our costs of carbon steel products along with limited supply during most of carbon steel costs increased significantly in the first nine months of  with the most rapid and pronounced increases in the first half of the year 
supply was limited due to raw material shortages at the mill level resulting from increased global demand  especially china  and reduced domestic capacity 
this resulted in increased costs from the mills and an environment that allowed us to pass through our increased costs to our customers 
in some cases  we were able to pass through the significant cost increases before we received the higher cost metal in our inventory 
we did experience some softening of carbon steel prices in the fourth quarter of our prices for aluminum and stainless steel products increased consistently during most of due to reduced supply and improved customer demand  especially for aerospace products 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of million increased from mainly because of the increased pricing levels of our products in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  up from in the improvement in our gross profit percentage resulted from the improved business conditions discussed above that allowed us to pass through our cost increases to our customers  especially in the first half of when we were able to increase our selling prices before we received the higher cost metal in our inventory 
due to the increased cost of our metals  our cost of sales includes million of lifo expense  compared to million of lifo expense in lifo expense reduces our gross profit 

table of contents expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased million  or from this increase includes a full year of s  g a expenses of precision strip  along with increased expenses to support our higher sales levels  including higher incentives and bonuses due to the record profit levels achieved at many of our operations 
our s  g a expenses represented of sales in  down from in the improvement as a percentage of sales was mainly because of the significant increases in our average selling price per ton sold  which did not require us to change our expense structure 
depreciation expense increased million in over mainly because of the additional expense related to precision strip 
operating profit 
operating profit was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating profit of million and an operating profit margin of 
the significant improvement occurred because of the improved business conditions  especially the favorable pricing  discussed above 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to increased borrowing levels to fund our increased working capital needs in and to fund the acquisition of precision strip on july  although variable interest rates increased in  we were able to offset the effect of this as the pricing on our borrowings declined due to our improved profitability 
minority interest expense increased in compared to mainly due to the improved operating performance at our owned company  american steel  that sells primarily carbon steel plate products 
minority interest also includes expense related to valex korea during the first seven months of that was attributable to our partner 
in july we purchased the remaining interest in valex korea from our partner 
valex korea s performance benefited from a strong asian market for semiconductor products in income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in  down from in  mainly due to shifts in the geographic composition of our income  lower income tax rates from our foreign operations that were profitable in and benefits from state and city income tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our working capital was million  up from million at december  the overall increase was primarily from the additional working capital of chapel steel 
excluding the acquired balances of chapel steel  our accounts receivable increased million and our inventory increased million to support our improved sales levels 
these amounts were offset by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses of million mainly from our increased costs of inventory 
to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are our two most significant elements of working capital 
although the amount of our accounts receivable increased in  our accounts receivable days sales outstanding rate at december  was days  improved from our december  rate of days 
we calculate our days sales outstanding as an average of the most recent two month period 
our inventory turnover rate improved to about times in from about times in due to improved demand and effective inventory management 
as demand and pricing for our products increase or decrease  our working capital needs increase or decrease  respectively 
we expect to finance increases in our working capital needs through operating cash flow or with borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 
our primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and our revolving line of credit 
cash flow provided by operations was million in compared to million in our strong cash flow resulted from our high profit levels and our continued effective working capital management 
we used this cash flow to acquire chapel steel  to pay down debt of approximately million  and to fund our capital expenditures of approximately million in to fund the purchase of chapel steel and the repayment of its outstanding debt  we borrowed million on our line of credit on july  as of december   all the borrowings on our line of credit were fully repaid from our cash flow from operations 
we had million of letters of credit outstanding under our million credit facility  with availability to issue an additional million of letters of credit at december  in we paid down million of private placement notes upon their maturity with cash flow from operations 
our net debt to total capital ratio at december  was  down from at december  on january   we paid off a million private placement note upon its maturity and purchased the remaining of american steel for million with borrowings on our credit facility 

table of contents in june  we replaced our million credit facility with a million  five year  unsecured revolving credit facility with fifteen banks 
the million facility was scheduled to mature in october we wanted to take advantage of the favorable bank market  which allowed us to obtain more favorable pricing on our borrowings  along with providing greater flexibility 
we initially approached the market to raise million  but because of the favorable response  we increased the commitment to million to support the growth of our business over the next five years 
we also have million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding senior notes bear interest at an average fixed rate of and have an average remaining life of years  maturing from to in  million of these notes will mature 
our million syndicated credit facility and our senior notes require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio and includes restrictions on the amount of cash dividends we may pay 
both the million syndicated credit agreement that was replaced in june and the senior notes became secured on july  concurrent with our acquisition of precision strip 
the personal property pledged as collateral included  but was not limited to  the outstanding securities of each of our material corporate subsidiaries 
the security interest terminated when we met certain conditions  including a required leverage ratio 
in the first quarter of the security interest granted under our syndicated credit facility and our senior note agreements was automatically released as we met the required conditions of the release 
the senior note agreements and our new million credit facility are unsecured 
upon our acquisition of chapel steel  we assumed noncancelable capital leases related to three buildings with terms expiring at various years through at december   total obligations under these capital leases were million 
all three leases were with related parties of chapel steel 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million for the year 
our capital expenditures are currently budgeted at approximately million  excluding acquisitions 
our budget includes several growth initiatives to expand or relocate existing facilities and to purchase certain facilities that are currently leased 
any capital expenditure commitments that existed at december  are included in the below table of contractual obligations 
our capital and operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are also included in the contractual obligations table below 
our capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and materials handling and processing equipment 
if the pending merger with emj is completed  we will be required to make cash payments of approximately million and issue reliance common stock valued at approximately million 
the estimated purchase price of the acquisition is based upon a price of about per share of emj common stock  payable approximately half in cash and half in reliance common stock 
each emj shareholder will receive in cash and a fraction of a reliance share for each share of emj common stock 
the cash portion  which includes the cash out of certain emj options and estimated transaction costs  will be financed under our million syndicated credit facility 
additionally  we will assume approximately million of emj s existing long term debt  adjusted by any payments or borrowings made by emj prior to the closing of the acquisition 
in february  we obtained the consent of our bank group to complete the emj acquisition and obtained amendments to both our syndicated credit facility and our private placement notes to allow for emj s senior secured indentures of million 
in addition  upon closing of the emj acquisition  our syndicated credit facility will be increased to million from million 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations and funds available under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and senior debt repayment needs for the foreseeable future 
we also anticipate that we will be able to fund acquisitions with borrowings under our line of credit  including the emj acquisition 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
payments due by year in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total amounts include principal payments only 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding interest rates and payment dates 
includes capital expenditure items committed to as of december   including three lease buy out options at fair market value estimated at million 
includes non cancelable purchase or service contracts with a term of one year or greater that existed at december  the majority of our material purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table 
also includes the amount of the put option to purchase the remaining interest in american steel  llc  for million per the terms of the operating agreement 
this purchase was completed on january  includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s defined benefit pension plans and serp plans for the next ten years 
these amounts are limited to the information provided by our actuaries 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
in may  our board of directors amended and restated our stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional six million shares of our common stock to be repurchased 
repurchased shares are redeemed and treated as authorized but unissued shares 
as of december   and prior to the additional authorization in may  we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock under this plan  at an average cost of per share 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during  or we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options during were million 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 

table of contents seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  because of vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill deemed to have indefinite lives is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
we measure possible impairment based on either significant losses of an entity or the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if impairment is identified  we would calculate the amount of such impairment based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
we have performed tests of goodwill as of november  and  and believe that the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and that no impairment currently exists 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues bankruptcy status  our past collection history  current financial and credit agency reports  and the experience of our credit personnel 
accounts which we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and estimated future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventories we maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions including those that may result from the american jobs creation act of  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we have performed impairment testing in accordance with sfas no 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we estimate the reporting unit s fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires us to estimate income from operations based on historical results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
a key assumption made is that  in general  our revenues will grow at to per year  adjusted for the current economic outlook 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in april  the united states securities and exchange commission sec approved statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  that is effective for us january  under sfas no

currently  we are only required to disclose the amount of such expense in the notes to our financial statements 
we will apply this statement to all awards granted on or after january   to unvested options as of january   and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
we expect that the implementation of the provisions of sfas no

sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  
table of contents in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf 
the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market ie  without long term contracts we are able to react to changes in metals pricing 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
volatility in these markets could impact our net income 
based on our limited foreign operations we do not consider this risk to be material 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
decreases in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on our debt  we do not consider the exposure to interest rate risk to be material 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not callable until maturity
