table of contents liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at october  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to cash flows provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of restaurants to franchisees  assets held for sale and leaseback and the issuance of common stock  which offset the company s stock repurchase program and property and equipment expenditures 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants  to repurchase shares of our common stock  as well as to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
financial condition 
the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets 
credit facility 
our credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on january  with a rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus and ii a million term loan maturing on january  with a rate of libor plus

to reduce the company s letter of credit fees incurred under the credit facility  the company entered into a separate cash collateralized letter of credit agreement in october at october   the company had letters of credit outstanding under this agreement of million  which were collateralized by approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
although the company intends to continue this agreement  it has the ability to terminate the cash collateralized letter of credit agreement thereby eliminating restrictions on the cash and cash equivalents balance 
interest rate swaps 
we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable rate debt 
to reduce it s exposure to rising interest rates  the company entered into three interest rate swap agreements 
in march  under two agreements  the company effectively converted million of its variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis through march these agreements effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate bank debt and have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of including the term loan s applicable margin

the agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges under the terms of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  with effectiveness assessed on changes in the present value of the term loan interest payments 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness in or accordingly  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts were recorded  net of taxes  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of october  covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various credit agreements  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments and dividend payments  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
as of october   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
total debt outstanding decreased to million at october  from million at october   due to scheduled repayments made during the year  including payments made on capital lease obligations

future liquidity

our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
additional potential sources of liquidity include the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 

table of contents discussion of critical accounting policies we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
retirement benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans  including assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels  as determined by the company using specified guidelines 
in addition  our outside actuarial consultants also use certain statistical factors such as turnover  retirement and mortality rates to estimate the company s future benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
self insurance the company is self insured for a portion of its current and prior years losses related to its workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical  and dental programs 
in estimating the company s self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analyses of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review includes a restaurant level analysis that takes into consideration a restaurant s operating cash flows  the period of time since a restaurant has been opened or remodeled  and the maturity of the related market 
when indicators of impairment are present  we perform an impairment analysis on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the net carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain restaurant closures and to write down assets associated with restaurants which we continue to operate 
during  we noted no other indicators of impairment of our long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our franchisees to make required payments 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
the company has good relationships with its franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate 
future application of accounting principles in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements of accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impractical 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the 
table of contents change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after the statement was issued 
we expect the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensuses of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf indicates that the income statement presentation on either a gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the issue is an accounting policy decision 
the company s accounting policy is to present the taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value  and expands fair value disclosure requirements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that currently require or permit fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact that sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability 
under sfas  unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses must be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
additionally  sfas requires that companies measure their plan assets and benefit obligations at the end of their fiscal year 
sfas is effective as of the end of fiscal years ending after december   except for the measurement date provisions which are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we will not be able to determine the impact the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements until the end of fiscal year when such valuation is completed 
however  based on valuations performed as of june   had we been required to adopt the provisions of sfas as of october   our qualified defined benefit plan and unfunded non qualified defined benefit plan and postretirement benefit plans would have been underfunded by million  million and million  respectively 
to recognize our underfunded positions and to appropriately record our unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  we would have been required to decrease stockholders equity by million for our defined benefit plans and increase stockholders equity by approximately million for our postretirement benefit plans 
as of october   in accordance with existing pension literature  we have recorded a prepaid benefit cost for our qualified defined benefit plan of million 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab is effective for the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
the company uses interest rate swaps agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at october   the company had two interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of million expiring march these agreements effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of including the term loan s applicable margin of 
the company also has a forward looking swap effective march with a notional amount of million expiring in april this agreement effectively converts a portion of the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and has an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of including the term loan s applicable margin of 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or the libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
the majority of the credit facility borrowings are libor based 
as of october   our applicable margins for the libor based revolving loans and 
table of contents term loan were set at and  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at october   would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
the estimated increase is based on holding the unhedged portion of bank debt at its october  level 
changes in interest rates also impact our pension expense  as do changes in the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets 
an assumed discount rate is used in determining the present value of future cash outflows currently expected to be required to satisfy the pension benefit obligation when due 
additionally  an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is used in determining the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide the benefits to meet our projected benefit obligation 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our future annual pension expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
there were no open futures or options contracts at october  at october   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure other than our company owned life insurance policies
