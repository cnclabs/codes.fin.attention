item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this discussion and analysis  the words we  us  our  and the company are used to refer to new york community bancorp  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries  including new york community bank and new york commercial bank 
executive summary we are a leading financial institution in the new york metropolitan region  with total assets of billion at december  our two primary subsidiaries are new york community bank  a new york state chartered savings bank with branches serving customers in new york city  long island  westchester county  and northern new jersey  and new york commercial bank  a new york state chartered commercial bank with branches serving long island and the borough of brooklyn  new york 
for the purpose of the discussion and analysis that follows  new york community bank and new york commercial bank are referred to collectively as the banks and respectively as the community bank and the commercial bank 
as noted in the overview earlier in this report  our financial performance has historically been driven by a business strategy with three core components the origination of multi family mortgage loans  a consistently solid level of asset quality  and the efficient operation of our retail banking franchise and our company 
to diversify our asset mix  we also originate commercial real estate and construction loans  primarily in new york city and on long island and  with the establishment of our commercial bank subsidiary at the end of december  have increased our production of commercial business loans to small and mid size businesses 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income generated by the loans we produce and the securities we invest in  and the interest expense generated by our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
the level of net interest income we generate is influenced by a variety of factors  some of which are somewhat within our control eg  our mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and some of which are not eg  the level of short term interest rates and market rates of interest  and the degree of competition we face for deposits and loans 
in the past five years  our earnings have been significantly strengthened by a series of merger transactions and  to a lesser extent  by our generation of non interest income in various forms 
in addition to fee income on depository accounts and loans  we generate non interest income through our equity interest in peter b 
cannell co  inc pbc  an investment advisory firm with billion of assets under management as of the end of december  through our investment in bank owned life insurance boli  and through the sale of third party investment products and one to four family loans to a third party conduit 
consistent with our strategy of growing through merger transactions  we announced two strategic transactions in on august st  we announced plans to acquire long island financial corp 
long island financial  the holding company for long island commercial bank  a full service commercial bank with branches on long island and one in brooklyn 
on october th  we announced plans to acquire atlantic bank of new york atlantic bank  a full service commercial bank with branches in manhattan  queens  brooklyn  westchester county and nassau county  collectively 
by providing us with a more extensive commercial banking platform  the transactions with long island financial and atlantic bank are expected to diversify our asset mix by increasing our portfolio of loans to small and mid size businesses  and to diversify our funding mix with an infusion of low cost core deposits and non interest bearing accounts 
in addition  the atlantic bank transaction will augment our presence in manhattan  where we currently have a single in store branch of the community bank 
the long island financial transaction was completed on the th of december  with shareholders of long island financial receiving shares of our common stock for each share of long island financial common stock held at the merger date 
the atlantic bank transaction is currently awaiting regulatory approval and is expected to take place early in the second quarter of the atlantic bank acquisition will be an all cash transaction  with a million purchase price 
our financial performance in both and  our financial performance was significantly affected by the dramatic rise in short term rates of interest  and the initial volatility and then more modest rise in intermediate term interest rates 
as a result of the movements in short term rates and intermediate term rates of interest  the yield curve began to flatten in the third quarter of and ultimately inverted at the end of the following discussion focuses on the impact of this rate environment on our financial performance and the specific actions we took in to mitigate our exposure to interest rate and market risk 
to more fully understand the strategies we pursued in  we believe it would be useful to summarize the series of actions we took at the end of june to reposition our balance sheet 
at a time when rates were rising more rapidly and more dramatically than had been expected  we reduced our securities portfolio by selling billion of available for sale securities  and utilized the proceeds to reduce our balance of wholesale borrowings by a like amount 
at the same time  we extended billion of short term borrowings to an average three year maturity and reclassified billion of available for sale securities as held to maturity 
while the securities were sold at a net loss of million  or per diluted share  on an after tax basis  the sacrifice to earnings was offset by the improvement in our market and interest rate risk profile at a time of significant and increasing interest rate volatility 
in the second half of  the repositioning of the balance sheet continued and the balance of our securities portfolio continued to decline 
the cash flows produced through securities repayments and sales were deployed into mortgage loan production  which was also supported by a modest level of deposit growth 
the rise in deposits was paralleled by a decline in wholesale borrowings  as we focused on diversifying and expanding our sources of funds 
at the same time  we realized an increase in our tangible capital measures from the levels recorded prior to the initial repositioning of the balance sheet 
please see the discussion and reconciliation of stockholders equity and tangible stockholders equity earlier in this report 
in  we maintained our focus on achieving the goals we had established in connection with the repositioning of our balance sheet at the end of june reducing our securities through a combination of repayments and sales  utilizing the cash flows to grow our loan portfolio  expanding and diversifying our sources of funds  with an emphasis on growing deposits  and producing solid measures of tangible capital strength 
the following is a summary of the enhancements to our balance sheet from the time of the initial repositioning at the end of june through december  securities totaled billion at december   representing of total assets  a billion  or  reduction from billion  representing of total assets  just prior to the initial balance sheet repositioning 
loans totaled billion at december   and represented of total assets  as compared to billion  representing of total assets  at june  the increase reflects originations of billion over the eighteen month period and includes million of loans acquired in the long island financial transaction 
multi family loans accounted for billion of the increase in total loans  having grown to billion over the eighteen month period  representing of loans outstanding at december  the increase in multi family loans reflects originations totaling billion  including billion in deposits totaled billion at december   reflecting a billion  or  increase from the june  balance  while wholesale borrowings declined billion  or  to billion from the balance recorded just prior to the initial repositioning of the balance sheet 
the increase in deposits was attributable to a variety of company initiatives  including the establishment of a premier banking group to attract and service depository accounts from local developers and property owners  the launch of an online banking service to attract deposits from within and beyond our marketplace  the initiation of a marketing campaign to attract and lock in longer term funds at prevailing rates of interest  the acceptance of brokered deposits  and the acquisition of long island financial  which contributed deposits of million  including million of low cost core deposits 
tangible stockholders equity rose million from the level recorded at june  to billion and equaled of tangible assets 
the increase in tangible stockholders equity reflects total contributions to capital of million over the eighteen month period  and the issuance of million shares of the company s common stock totaling million in connection with the long island financial transaction 
reflecting the strength of our tangible capital  we maintained our cash dividend at per quarter throughout the year 
while our balance sheet at december  reflects these achievements  our income statement primarily reflects the negative impact of the interest rate environment on our net interest income  which declined million year over year to million  in tandem with a basis point reduction in our net interest margin to 
the contraction of our net interest income and net interest margin was primarily attributable to the following factors the significant rise in short term interest rates  which coincided with our efforts to increase deposits  and contributed to a basis point increase in our cost of funds  and the comparatively low level of market interest rates  which limited the yields on our new loan production while also inhibiting loan refinancing and  therefore  prepayment penalties 
while our net interest income declined in  the reduction was partially tempered by our having recorded non interest income of million versus a non interest loss of million in the amount reflects the impact of two non recurring charges a pre tax net loss of million on the sale of securities in connection with the repositioning of the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter  and a pre tax loss of million on the other than temporary impairment of certain perpetual preferred fnma securities 
while fee income declined million in from the prior year level  the reduction was substantially offset by a million increase in other income  net securities gains of million  and a million net gain on the sale of certain bank owned properties 
the revenues we generated in were partly offset by a million increase in non interest expense to million  reflecting a million increase in operating expenses to million and a  increase in the amortization of core deposit intangibles cdi to million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to reflect the allocation of employee stock ownership plan esop shares in connection with the acquisition of long island financial referred to hereafter as the merger related charge 
in addition to the merger related charge  the rise in operating expenses was largely attributable to staff expansion  and to a year over year increase in occupancy and equipment expense 
during the year  we continued to make improvements to our branch network  and to expedite customer service by upgrading our information technology 
the merger related charge was equivalent to million  or per diluted share  on an after tax basis  and reduced our net income to million  or per diluted share 
because the acquisition of long island financial was completed on the last business day of december  its contribution to earnings did not commence until january critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as being critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
certain accounting policies are considered to be important to the portrayal of our financial condition  since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  and the judgments  estimates  and assumptions used therein  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provisions for loan losses charged to operations and reduced by net charge offs or reversals 
a separate loan loss allowance is established for each of the community bank and the commercial bank and  except as otherwise noted  the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses is the same for each 
management establishes the allowances for loan losses through an assessment of probable losses in each of the respective loan portfolios 
several factors are considered in this process  including historical and projected default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  loan size  economic  geographic  industry  and environmental factors  and loan impairment  as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
under sfas nos 
and  a loan is classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan 
we apply sfas nos 
and to all loans except smaller balance homogenous loans and loans carried at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
in establishing the loan loss allowances  management also considers the banks current business strategies and credit processes  including compliance with stringent guidelines established by the respective boards of directors with regard to credit limitations  loan approvals  underwriting criteria  and loan workout procedures 
in accordance with the pertinent policies  the allowances for loan losses are segmented to correspond to the various types of loans in the loan portfolios 
these loan categories are assessed with specific emphasis on the internal risk ratings  underlying collateral  credit underwriting  loan size  and geographic area 
these factors correspond to the respective levels of quantified and inherent risk 
the assessments take into consideration loans that have been adversely rated  primarily through the valuation of the collateral supporting each loan 
adversely rated loans are loans that are either non performing or that exhibit certain weaknesses that could jeopardize payment in accordance with the original terms 
larger loans are assigned risk ratings based upon a routine review of the credit files  while smaller loans exceeding days in arrears are assigned risk ratings based upon an aging schedule 
quantified risk factors are assigned for each risk rating category to provide an allocation to the overall loan loss allowance 
the remainder of each loan portfolio is then assessed  by loan type  with similar risk factors being considered  including the borrower s ability to pay and our past loan loss experience with each type of loan 
these loans are also assigned quantified risk factors  which result in allocations to the allowances for loan losses for each particular loan or loan type in the portfolio 
in order to determine their overall adequacy  each of the respective loan loss allowances is reviewed quarterly by management and by the mortgage and real estate committee of the community bank s board of directors or the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank  as applicable 
each of the independent directors who serve on these committees has had more than years of complementary experience 
other factors and processes considered in determining the appropriate level of the allowances for loan losses include  but are not limited to end of period levels and observable trends in non performing loans  charge offs experienced over prior periods  including an analysis of the underlying factors leading to the delinquencies and subsequent charge offs if any  periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified in house property appraisers inspectors  as applicable  regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committee  during which observable trends in the local economy and or the real estate market are discussed  full assessment by the pertinent board of directors of the aforementioned factors when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes on the future level of the allowance for loan losses  and analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate  as well as on an individual loan basis  taking into consideration payment history  underwriting analyses  and internal risk ratings 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the respective loan loss allowances may be necessary  based on changes in economic and local market conditions beyond management s control 
in addition  the community bank and or the commercial bank may be required to take certain charge offs and or recognize additions to their loan loss allowances  based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided to them during their examinations 
investment securities the securities portfolio consists of mortgage related securities and debt and equity other securities 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the market values of our securities  particularly fixed rate mortgage related securities  are affected by changes in market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities will decline  as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities will increase 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its carrying value is other than temporary 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
if we deem any decline in value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged against earnings 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  at the reporting unit level  at least once a year 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount at the time of testing  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in the identification of reporting units and the use of valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  we have identified one reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january   and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value  using the quoted market price of our common stock on the impairment testing date as the basis for determining fair value 
as of the annual impairment test date  there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
in addition  we found no indication of goodwill impairment when we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january  income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based on the amount we expect to owe the various tax authorities ie  federal  state  and local 
income taxes represent the net estimated amount due to  or to be received from  such taxing authorities 
in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
in this process  management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
although we use available information to record income taxes  underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall tax position 
balance sheet summary we recorded total assets of billion at december   signifying a billion  or  increase from the balance recorded at december  included in the year end amount were the assets acquired in the long island financial transaction  which totaled million 
during  we continued to enhance the quality of our asset mix and our market risk profile  by utilizing the cash flows from securities and an increase in deposits to grow our loan portfolio 
as a result  total loans rose billion  or  over the course of the year  to billion  while total securities declined billion  or to billion 
while the long island financial transaction contributed loans of million  the growth of the loan portfolio was substantially fueled by organic loan production  with originations totaling billion in at december   loans and securities represented and  respectively  of total assets  in contrast to and  respectively  at december  the quality of our assets was reflected in a modest level of charge offs and year over year improvements in the ratios of non performing assets and loans to total assets and loans 
charge offs totaled  in  and consisted entirely of consumer and unsecured loans that had been acquired in merger transactions 
non performing assets represented of total assets at december   a one basis point improvement from the year earlier measure  while non performing loans represented of total loans  an improvement of five basis points 
in addition  the allowance for loan losses rose million year over year to million  reflecting the loan loss allowance acquired in connection with the long island financial transaction 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  we intensified our focus on funding  both expanding and diversifying our sources of funds 
while wholesale borrowings defined as fhlb ny advances and repurchase agreements totaled billion at year end  representing a modest rise of million  deposits rose billion  or  to billion 
the long island financial transaction contributed wholesale borrowings of million and deposits of million to the respective totals  million  or  of the deposits acquired in the transaction were core deposits  and included million of non interest bearing accounts 
stockholders equity rose million year over year to billion  partially reflecting our issuance of million shares totaling million in connection with the acquisition of long island financial 
the year end balance was equivalent to of total assets and a book value of per share based on  shares 
loans loans are  and have historically been  the company s principal asset  with multi family loans long representing our primary lending niche 
we are the leading producer of multi family loans for portfolio in new york city  with an emphasis on loans secured by buildings that are rent controlled or stabilized 
in  of the city s rental housing market consisted of such rent regulated buildings  consistent with the percentage reported for to diversify our lending mix  we also originate commercial real estate and construction loans on properties throughout the new york metropolitan region  but primarily in new york city and nassau and suffolk counties on long island 
we also originate one to four family loans  but on a pass through basis only  selling such loans to a third party conduit shortly after the loans are closed 
with the acquisition of long island financial at the end of december  we acquired a modest portfolio of commercial business loans to small and mid size businesses 
in connection with the pending acquisition of atlantic bank  a commercial bank with branches in manhattan  queens  brooklyn  westchester county  and nassau county  the portfolio is expected to grow  and our marketplace to expand 
our loan portfolio totaled billion at december   signifying a a billion  or  increase from the balance recorded at december  although the long island financial transaction contributed loans of million to the year end total  the year over year increase was primarily fueled by organic loan production  with originations totaling billion  up million from the prior year amount 
multi family loan originations accounted for of loan production  with commercial real estate and construction loans accounting for and  respectively 
the growth of the loan portfolio was partly tempered by repayments totaling billion and sales of one to four family loans totaling million over the course of the year 
primarily reflecting the manner in which the vast majority of our multi family  commercial real estate  and construction loans are structured  of our loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate credits  with fixed rate loans accounting for the remaining

at december   billion  or of our multi family loans were secured by rental apartment buildings and billion  or  were secured by underlying mortgages on cooperative apartment buildings 
nearly of our multi family loans were secured by buildings in new york city  with manhattan accounting for the largest percentage  
another of multi family loans were secured by buildings in other parts of new york state or new jersey  with the remaining secured by buildings outside our immediate market  many of which are owned by borrowers we have made loans to successfully within our local marketplace 
we primarily base the amount of the multi family loans we originate on the current cash flows produced by the building  utilizing the income method of appraising the properties  rather than the sales method  which is subject to fluctuations in real estate market conditions and the general economy 
we also consider a variety of other factors  including the value and condition of the underlying property  the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio  which is the ratio of the property s net operating income to its debt service  and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property 
the amount of a multi family loan may represent no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying properties  with an amortization period of up to years 
we also require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of on multi family buildings  although a minimum is more typical of our multi family credits  and a security interest in the personal property at the premises and an assignment of rents 
at december   the multi family loan portfolio had an average balance of million and an average loan to value ratio of 
at december   the average principal balance and loan to value ratio were million and  respectively 
in addition to qualifying a multi family loan on the basis of the building s income and condition  we also consider the borrower s credit history  profitability  and building management expertise 
because of our longevity in the multi family market and the tendency of borrowers to refinance  we also consider our own prior experience with the owner of the property 
borrowers are required to present evidence of the ability to repay the mortgage from the building s rent rolls  and a history of making mortgage payments in accordance with the terms of prior and existing loans 
in assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower  we also generally review his or her financial statements and related documents 
multi family loans are typically made to long term property owners who utilize the funds they borrow to make improvements to the building and the apartments within 
our multi family loans generally feature a term of ten years  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the mortgage  and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten 
the rate charged in the first five years is generally based on the five year constant maturity treasury rate the five year cmt plus a margin of basis points  during years six through ten  the borrower has the option of selecting a monthly adjustable rate that is currently basis points above the prime rate of interest  as reported in the new york times  or a fixed rate that is currently basis points above the five year cmt 
the latter option also requires the payment of one point of the then outstanding loan amount 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five year term 
as improvements are made to the collateral property  regulations permit an increase in the rents on the apartments  thus creating more cash flows for the owner to borrow against 
as the rent roll increases  the property owner typically opts to refinance the mortgage  even in a rising interest rate environment 
this cycle has repeated itself over the course of many decades  with property values increasing  and borrowers typically refinancing well before the loan reaches its sixth year 
accordingly  the expected weighted average life of the multi family loan portfolio was years at december  multi family loans that refinance within the first five years are subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule 
depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment  the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the original loan balance 
while such penalties clearly represent a potential source of income  they also serve as a useful negotiating tool 
because a portion of the loans in the portfolio tend to refinance with us  the potential for future portfolio growth is enhanced with every new loan we originate 
our emphasis on multi family loans is driven by several factors  including their structure  which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree 
another factor driving our focus on multi family loans is the consistent quality of these assets we have not had a loss of principal on a multi family loan in our niche for more than twenty five years 
we generally consider multi family loans to involve a modest degree of credit risk as compared to other types of credits  since the loans we make are typically collateralized by rent regulated buildings which tend to be stable and fully occupied 
because the buildings securing the loans are generally well maintained  and because the rents are typically below market  occupancy levels remain more or less constant  even during times of economic adversity 
the approval process for multi family loans is also highly efficient  typically taking a period of four to eight weeks 
we have been originating multi family loans for several decades and were one of the few banks in the region to continue producing such loans during the last downturn in the economic cycle  two decades ago 
our success in this lending niche reflects the solid relationships we have developed during this time with the market s leading mortgage brokers  who are familiar with our lending practices  our underwriting standards  and our long standing practice of lending on the cash flows produced by the buildings collateralizing these loans 
because the multi family market is largely broker driven  the process of producing such loans is significantly expedited and the attendant expenses substantially reduced 
commercial real estate loans commercial real estate loans totaled billion at december   representing of total loans outstanding and a million  or  increase from the balance recorded at december  in addition to million of commercial real estate loans acquired in the long island financial transaction  the increase reflects twelve month originations totaling million  a decline of million from the prior year amount 
the majority of our commercial real estate loans are secured by retail shopping centers anchored by national credit rated tenants and by office and mixed use buildings 
at december   of our commercial real estate loans were secured by properties in new york city  with properties on long island accounting for another 
we structure our commercial real estate loans along the same lines as our multi family credits  ie  with a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally tied to the five year cmt plus a margin of basis points 
for years six through ten  the borrower has the option of selecting a monthly adjustable rate that is currently basis points above the prime rate of interest  or a fixed rate that is currently basis points above the five year cmt 
the latter option also requires the payment of one point of the then outstanding loan amount 
the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate featured in the initial five year term 
prepayment penalties also apply  with five percentage points generally being charged on loans that refinance in the first year  scaling down to one percentage point on loans that refinance in year five 
our commercial real estate loans also tend to refinance within five years of origination  and the expected weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december  the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties 
in addition  a decline in real estate values or in economic conditions could have a greater impact on the ability to repay a commercial real estate loan than a residential mortgage loan 
to minimize the risk involved  we originate commercial real estate loans in adherence with stringent underwriting standards  and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the property s income stream and debt service coverage ratio 
accordingly  the amount of each loan is based upon the net operating income produced by the collateral property  and may not exceed of the appraised value thereof  although is more typical of the commercial real estate loans we produce 
the approval of a loan also depends on the borrower s credit history  profitability  and expertise in property management  and requires a debt service coverage ratio of at least 
at december   our portfolio of commercial real estate loans had an average principal balance of million and an average loan to value ratio of 
the origination of commercial real estate loans generally requires a security interest in the personal property and or an assignment of the rents and or leases 
construction loans the construction loan portfolio totaled million at december   representing of total loans outstanding and a million  or  increase from the year end amount 
the increase was fueled by twelve month originations totaling million  up million from the prior year volume  and also reflects million of construction loans acquired in the long island financial transaction 
the increase in construction loans reflects the efficacy of the relationships we have developed with several of our region s leading developers and builders or that were developed by our merger partners in the past 
at december   of our construction loans were for construction and development on long island  with the five boroughs of new york city accounting for  combined 
residential subdivision loans are typically originated for terms of to months  with a prime based floating rate of interest 
such loans have had a strong credit history  with no losses recorded for more than a decade  they also generate fee income in the form of points that are amortized over the life of the loan 
we also originate loans for the construction of owner occupied one to four family homes under contract and  to a lesser extent  for the acquisition and development of commercial real estate and multi family properties 
these loans are also comparatively short term in nature  ranging up to three years for one to four family home construction and up to two years for the development of commercial and multi family properties 
such loans feature a daily floating prime based index and have a minimum floor 
because construction and development loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk than loans on multi family buildings  borrowers are required to provide a personal guarantee during construction and a permanent loan commitment 
the risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value upon completion of construction  as compared to the estimated cost of construction  including interest  and upon the estimated time to sell or lease such properties 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  or the length of time to sell or lease it is greater than anticipated  the property could have a value upon completion that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the loan 
when applicable  it is our practice to require that residential properties be pre sold or that borrowers secure permanent financing commitments from a recognized lender for an amount equal to  or greater than  the amount of the loan we make 
in some cases  we ourselves may provide permanent financing 
one to four family loans since december   we have maintained a policy of originating one to four family loans on a pass through basis only 
applications are taken and processed by a third party conduit  and the loans are sold to the conduit or its affiliates  without recourse  servicing released  shortly after they close 
in connection with this practice  we have entered into a private label program for the origination of one to four family and home equity loans under a mortgage origination assistance agreement with a nationally recognized third party mortgage originator the conduit 
under this program  we utilize the conduit s internet and telephone platforms to originate one to four family and home equity loans  based on defined underwriting criteria that we have approved 
the loans are marketed through our branch network and our web site  and are intended to serve our existing customers and attract new ones  as well 
we fund the loans directly and  under a separate loan and servicing rights purchase and sale agreement with the conduit  have the option of retaining the loans for portfolio  selling the loans to a third party investor  or delivering the loans to the conduit at an agreed upon price 
the conduit pays us a fee at the time a loan is delivered  which exceeds the fee we pay to the conduit for processing the loan 
the fee income produced by each transaction is recorded as other non interest income 
in and  respectively  we originated million and million of one to four family and home equity loans that were subsequently sold to a third party conduit 
reflecting the conduit policy  repayments  and the bulk sale of one to four family loans totaling million in the second quarter  the balance of one to four family loans declined million  or  from the year end level  to million  representing of total loans  at december  the portfolio consists largely of seasoned loans that were acquired in our various merger transactions or were originated before the adoption of the conduit policy 
at december   the one to four family loan portfolio had an average principal balance of  and an average loan to value ratio of 
in addition to ensuring that our customers are provided with an extensive range of one to four family products  the conduit arrangement supports two of our primary objectives reducing our exposure to interest rate and credit risk  and promoting our efficiency 
one to four family loans have tended to be more susceptible to economic adversity and fluctuating interest rates than our multi family credits  in addition  they are more costly to originate and service than our multi family loans 
the conduit arrangement effectively eliminates the risks involved in one to four family lending  and substantially mitigates the higher costs involved 
other loans while mortgage loans represent the vast majority of our loans outstanding  we also offer a variety of other loans 
other loans rose million  or  year over year to million  primarily reflecting the addition of long island financial s loan portfolio 
commercial business loans accounted for million  or  of the year end balance  and included million of commercial business loans that were acquired in the long island financial transaction 
by comparison  we recorded million of commercial business loans at december  as a result of the long island financial transaction  we have enhanced our ability to provide such commercial loan products as term loans  demand loans  revolving credit loans  and loans that are guaranteed in part by the small business administration 
a broad range of commercial loans  both collateralized and uncollateralized  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion  and for the purchase of machinery and equipment 
the purpose of the loan is considered in determining its term and structure  the pricing is either equal  or tied  to the prime rate of interest 
the remainder of the portfolio of other loans consists of home equity loans and lines of credit  which are originated on a pass through basis  as well as a variety of consumer loans  most of which were originated by our merger partners prior to their joining the company 
lending authority the loans we originate are subject to federal and state laws and regulations  and are underwritten in accordance with loan underwriting policies and procedures approved by the mortgage and real estate committee of the board of directors of the community bank the mortgage committee  the credit committee of the board of directors of the commercial bank the credit committee  and the respective boards of directors as a whole 
in addition to the loans that we ourselves have originated  the portfolio consists of loans acquired in our merger transactions 
we generally do not purchase whole mortgage loans or loan participations 
in accordance with the community bank s policies  all loans of million or more must be reported to the board of directors 
in  such loans were produced by the community bank 
we also place a limit on the amount of loans that may be made to one borrower 
at december   the largest concentration of loans to one borrower consisted of a financing package provided by the community bank to riverbay corporation co op city  a residential community with  units in the bronx  new york  which was created under the mitchell lama housing program in the late s to provide affordable housing for middle income residents of new york state 
at origination  the financing consisted of a multi family loan in the amount of million and a construction loan of the same amount 
at december   million of the construction loan had been advanced  bringing the outstanding loan amount to million  representing the largest loan in our portfolio at year end the multi family loan was originated on september  for a term of years  with a rate of interest of in years one through five  in years six through ten  in years through  and a floor of in years through the construction loan features a floating rate of interest equal to basis points above prime 
on each anniversary of the original loan  the funds advanced under the construction component during the prior twelve month period are to be combined with the multi family loan 
accordingly  million of construction loan advances were combined with the multi family loan at december  the multi family loan thus amounted to million and the construction loan had million outstanding against a million commitment at december  construction advances are made as various states of construction are completed  as certified by a consulting engineer engaged by the company 
the combined credit of million is within the community bank s loans to one borrower limitation  and both components of the financing package were performing in accordance with their terms at year end loan maturity and repricing the following table sets forth the maturity or period to repricing of our loan portfolio at december  loans that have adjustable rates are shown as being due in the period during which the interest rates are next subject to change 
the table does not include prepayments or scheduled principal amortization 
prepayments and scheduled principal amortization totaled billion in mortgage and other loans at december  in thousands multi family commercial real estate construction one to four family other total loans amount due within one year after one year one to five years over five years total due or repricing after one year total amounts due or repricing  gross the following table sets forth  as of december   the dollar amount of all loans due after december   and indicates whether such loans have fixed or adjustable rates of interest 
due after december  in thousands fixed adjustable total mortgage loans multi family commercial real estate construction one to four family total mortgage loans other loans total loans outstanding loan commitments at december   we had outstanding loan commitments of billion  underscoring our focus on extending the growth of our loan portfolio 
in  we expect to maintain our emphasis on multi family lending  while complementing such credits with commercial real estate and construction loans 
building on the expertise acquired in the long island financial and pending atlantic bank transactions  we also expect to further enhance our mix of assets by increasing our portfolio of commercial business loans to small and mid size businesses 
in addition to our commitments to originate loans  we also had commitments to issue financial and performance stand by letters of credit of million and million  featuring terms of one year and one to three years  respectively 
financial stand by letters of credit obligate us to guarantee payment of a specific financial obligation on behalf of certain borrowers  while performance stand by letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under certain non financial contractual obligations 
the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of stand by letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
please see contractual obligations and off balance sheet commitments later in this report for a further discussion of financial and performance stand by letters of credit 
the volume of loans produced in will depend on several factors  including the level and direction of market interest rates and their impact on refinancing activity  the availability and cost of funds  competition from other banks and non financial institutions for loans and deposits  and the level of loan demand 
asset quality in  our performance continued to be distinguished by a strong level of asset quality 
in addition to charging off consumer and unsecured loans in the modest amount of  we reduced our ratios of non performing assets to total assets and of non performing loans to total loans 
at december  and  we recorded non performing assets of million and million  which were equivalent to and of total assets at the respective dates 
non performing loans accounted for million and million of the respective year end totals  and represented and of total loans 
included in non performing loans at year end were non accrual mortgage loans of million  non accrual other loans of million  and a million construction loan that was still accruing interest 
non performing loans are reviewed regularly by management and reported on a monthly basis to the mortgage committee  the credit committee  and the boards of directors of the banks 
when necessary  non performing loans are written down to their current appraised values  less certain transaction costs 
outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to borrowers who are delinquent in paying their loans 
a loan generally is classified as a non accrual loan when it is days past due and management has determined that the collectibility of the entire loan is doubtful 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  we cease the accrual of interest owed  and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income 
a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is less than days past due and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible 
in and  the amount of interest income that would have been recorded on non accrual loans had they been current was million and million  respectively 
properties that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as other real estate owned  and recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition  less the estimated cost of selling the property at that time 
at december   other real estate owned consisted of four properties totaling million  as compared to three properties totaling  at december  it is our policy to require an appraisal of such properties shortly before foreclosure and to re appraise the properties on an as needed basis until they are sold 
we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible  given current market conditions and the condition of the property 
other real estate owned is generally titled in the name of a wholly owned bank subsidiary  which manages the property while it is being offered for sale 
we are currently in the process of marketing the four properties acquired by foreclosure at prices that exceed their respective carrying values  and therefore do not expect to incur a loss of principal when such properties are sold 
the  of charge offs we recorded in  as well as the  of charge offs we recorded in the prior year s fourth quarter  consisted entirely of consumer and unsecured loans that had been acquired in merger transactions 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded no net charge offs for forty consecutive quarters  beginning in the fourth quarter of while the quality of the loan portfolio has been due in part to the relative strength of our local economy and real estate market  it also stands as a testament to the strength of our credit standards  and the consistency with which we have adhered to these standards while growing our loan portfolio 
in the case of multi family and commercial real estate loans  we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated to determine the property s economic value  and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan 
the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values  with the economic value being the value more typically used 
the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor 
every multi family building and commercial real estate property is inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval by executive management and the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
in addition  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on every multi family loan in excess of million 
similarly  a member of the mortgage or credit committee participates in inspections on every commercial real estate loan in excess of million 
furthermore  independent appraisers  whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced in house appraisal officers  perform appraisals on every multi family and commercial real estate property 
in addition  the loans we make have been brought to us by a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and have worked with our lending officers over the course of ten or more years 
to further minimize credit risk  our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 
although we typically will lend up to of the appraised value on multi family buildings and up to on commercial properties  the average loan to value ratio of such credits at december  was considerably lower  amounting to and  respectively 
exceptions to these loan to value limitations may be made on a case by case basis  and require the approval of the mortgage committee or credit committee  as applicable 
the construction loan portfolio also reflects board involvement  with a member of the pertinent committee participating in inspections on every loan exceeding million  and every construction loan requiring the approval of the mortgage or credit committee  as applicable 
the loans in this portfolio have been stringently underwritten  and are primarily made to well established builders who have worked with us or our merger partners in the past 
we typically will lend up to of the estimated market value  and up to in the case of home construction loans to individuals 
with respect to commercial construction loans  which are not our primary focus  we typically will lend up to of the estimated market value of the property 
credit risk is also reduced through the loan disbursement process 
loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses  and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers and or consulting engineers 
as a result of the long island financial transaction  we have increased our production of commercial business loans 
such loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the business  and are generally collateralized by such business assets as inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable 
as a result  the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful 
furthermore  the collateral underlying the loans may depreciate over time  may not be conducive to appraisal  and may fluctuate in value  based upon the business results 
accordingly  personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for commercial business loans 
our loan portfolio has been deliberately structured to reduce our exposure to both credit and interest rate risk 
the vast majority of the loans in our portfolio are intermediate term credits  with multi family and commercial real estate loans typically repaying or refinancing within three to five years of origination  and the duration of construction loans ranging up to months  with to months more the norm 
all three types of mortgage loans have a solid performance record  with no losses on principal recorded for more than years in the case of our multi family credits and more than ten years in the case of our commercial real estate and residential subdivision construction loans 
furthermore  our multi family loans are largely secured by rent regulated buildings  which tend to maintain a high level of occupancy  even in difficult economic times 
historically  our portfolios of multi family  commercial real estate  and construction loans have outperformed our one to four family credits  accordingly  we have been originating one to four family loans on a pass through basis  selling them to a third party conduit shortly after closing  without recourse 
to further reduce our exposure to the credit risk inherent in such assets  we sold million of one to four family loans from our portfolio in the second quarter of the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are consistent across all categories  with a late charge being assessed after fifteen days of delinquency  and a notice mailed the same day 
we then attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment 
when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure  we attempt to obtain full payment  and will also work out a repayment schedule to avoid foreclosing on the property 
while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully  the absence of delinquencies or losses cannot be guaranteed 
the ability of a borrower to fulfill his or her obligations may be impacted by various factors  including a change in personal circumstances or a downturn in local real estate values or the economy 
to minimize the impact of credit risk  we maintain coverage through an allowance for loan losses  which may be increased through the provision for loan losses charged to operations  or reduced through charge offs or reversals 
at december   our consolidated allowance for loan losses totaled million  as compared to million at december  the long island financial transaction contributed million to the year end balance  which also reflected the  of charge offs recorded during the year 
although long island financial had an allowance for loan losses of million at the time of the transaction  million of this amount was subtracted from the balance of loans acquired  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
at december  and  our consolidated allowance for loan losses represented and  respectively  of total loans and and  respectively  of non performing loans 
the manner in which the allowance for loan losses is established  and the assumptions made in that process  are considered critical to our financial condition and results 
such assumptions are based on judgments that are difficult  complex  and subjective  regarding various matters of inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  the policies that govern our assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading earlier in this report 
the following table presents information regarding the consolidated allowance for loan losses and non performing assets at each year end in the five years ended december  asset quality analysis at december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year allowance acquired in merger transactions charge offs balance at end of year non performing assets non accrual mortgage loans other non accrual loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to non performing loans allowance for loan losses to total loans we had no troubled debt restructurings  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  at any of the dates presented in the preceding table 
based upon all relevant and presently available information  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the consolidated allowance for loan losses at each year end in the five years ended december  summary of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands amount percent of allowance to total allowance amount percent of allowance to total allowance amount percent of allowance to total allowance amount percent of allowance to total allowance amount percent of allowance to total allowance mortgage loans multi family commercial real estate construction one to four family other loans total loans the preceding allocation is based upon an estimate of various factors  as discussed in critical accounting policies earlier in this report 
a different allocation methodology may be deemed to be more appropriate in the future 
securities while the growth of the loan portfolio was essential to enhancing our mix of assets  the reduction of the securities portfolio was equally vital to the achievement of this goal 
accordingly  securities declined billion  or  year over year to billion at december  and represented of total assets  as compared to at december  although the year end total was boosted by the acquisition of available for sale securities totaling million in the long island financial transaction  this amount was substantially offset by repayments totaling billion and sales totaling million over the course of the year 
these cash flows represented a significant source of funding for the growth of the loan portfolio in the investment policies of the company and the banks are established by the respective boards of directors and implemented by their respective investment committees  in concert with the asset and liability management committee of the company 
the investment committees generally meet quarterly or on an as needed basis to review the portfolios and specific securities transactions  in addition  the securities portfolios are reviewed monthly by the board of directors of the company as a whole 
in addition  the policies guiding the company s and the banks investments are reviewed at least annually by the respective investment committees  as well as by the respective boards 
while the policies permit investment in various types of liquid assets  neither the company nor the banks currently maintain a trading portfolio 
the types of investments permitted under the investment policies of the company and the banks include mortgage related securities issued and backed by fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and ginnie mae gnma collectively  government sponsored enterprises or gses  and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos collectively  mortgage related securities  as well as us government agency obligations  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations including capital trust notes  and corporate equities collectively  other securities 
while the investment policies of the company and the banks permit investment in cmos issued or sponsored by private issuers  such investments are limited to low risk securities rated not less than aa by at least two nationally recognized rating agencies  and having an average life of seven years or less 
furthermore  the credit ratings of the cmos in our portfolios are monitored on a regular basis 
our investment policies prohibit the purchase of higher risk cmos  defined as those which exhibit significantly greater volatility with regard to estimated average life and price relative to interest rates as compared with standard year fixed rate securities 
at december   the us government agency obligations in our portfolios primarily consisted of fixed and adjustable rate callable debentures that are generally callable after one year and in three month intervals thereafter 
capital trust notes primarily consist of notes issued by financial institutions 
such investments represent secondary capital and rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the issuing company 
the equity securities in our portfolios consist of common and preferred stock of us companies  the preferred stock is redeemable by the issuer  generally after an initial holding period 
we benefit from our investment in such stocks due to the tax deductions we receive in connection with the dividends paid by the corporate issuers on such securities 
depending on management s intent at the time of purchase  securities are classified as available for sale or as held to maturity 
while available for sale securities are intended to generate earnings  they also represent a significant source of cash flows and liquidity for future loan production and for general operating activities 
held to maturity securities also serve as a source of earnings and generate cash flows  although they are less liquid than available for sale securities 
available for sale securities represented billion  or  of total securities at december   and were down million  or  from the balance recorded at december   notwithstanding the addition of the long island financial portfolio 
mortgage related securities accounted for billion and billion  respectively  of the year end and totals  while other securities represented the remaining million and million  respectively 
reflecting the rise in market interest rates over the twelve month period  the after tax net unrealized loss on securities available for sale equaled million at december  and million at december   these amounts are recorded as a component of stockholders equity at the respective year ends 
held to maturity securities declined million  or  year over year  to billion  and represented of total securities at december  mortgage related securities accounted for billion and billion of the year end and totals  while other securities accounted for billion and billion  respectively 
included in the latter amounts were us government agency obligations of billion and billion  respectively  the remainder of the respective balances consisted of capital trust notes  corporate bonds  and preferred stock 
at december   the estimated weighted average life of the available for sale securities portfolio was years  the estimated weighted average life of the held to maturity securities portfolio was years at that date 
the mortgage related securities in the two portfolios  combined  had an expected weighted average estimated life of years  and a market value of approximately billion 
other investments bank owned life insurance boli at december   the company had a million investment in boli  as compared to million at december  the increase reflects the million of boli acquired in the long island financial transaction and an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies 
the purchase of the boli policies which was intended to offset future employee benefit costs and the related increase in cash surrender value are included in other assets in the consolidated statements of condition  and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value is included in other non interest income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

sources of funds on a stand alone basis  the company has four primary funding sources for the payment of dividends  share repurchases  and other corporate uses dividends paid to the company by the banks  capital raised through the issuance of debt instruments  capital raised through the issuance of stock  and repayments of  and income from  investment securities 
in  the growth of our loan portfolio was funded by the community bank  which has four primary funding sources principal repayments and interest on loans  cash flows from securities repayments and sales  deposits  and wholesale borrowings in the form of fhlb ny advances and repurchase agreements 
in  the commercial bank will complement these funding sources with comparable sources of funds 
the cash flows from loan repayments totaled billion in  while the cash flows from securities totaled billion  including repayments of billion and sales of million  as previously discussed 
deposits we offer an extensive menu of depository accounts featuring a range of terms and rates of interest  including certificates of deposit cds  as well as savings accounts  now and money market accounts  and non interest bearing demand deposit accounts collectively  core deposits 
reflecting a combination of organic growth  the benefit of the long island financial transaction  and the use of brokered deposits  total deposits rose billion  or  year over year to billion at december  cds represented billion of the year end balance  signifying a billion  or  increase  while core deposits represented billion  signifying an increase of million  or 
while the long island financial transaction accounted for million of the increase  the growth in cds largely reflects the success of our efforts to expand and diversify our sources of funds over the course of the year 
in the first quarter of  we established a premier banking group to attract deposits from developers and property owners  in the second quarter  we introduced mybankingdirect 
com  an online banking service  to attract deposits from within and beyond our local marketplace 
in the third quarter of  we launched a gift campaign to attract and lock in long term funds at attractive rates of interest 
the campaign was extended through the fourth quarter of the year 
while a year over year decline in savings accounts tempered the growth in core deposits  the year end balance reflects the benefit of the long island financial transaction  which contributed core deposits of million  including now and money market accounts of million  savings accounts of million  and non interest bearing accounts of million 
in addition  the level of core deposits at year end reflects our use of brokered deposits to fund the growth of the loan portfolio 
included in core deposits at december   were billion of now and money market accounts  signifying a year over year increase of million  and million of non interest bearing accounts  signifying a year over year increase of million 
these increases were partly offset by a million decline in savings accounts to billion  as customers took advantage of the substantial rise in short term rates of interest to transfer funds into higher yielding cds and money market accounts 
included in the year end balance of now and money market accounts were brokered deposits totaling billion 
depending on market conditions  we accept such deposits to support our loan production and to manage our interest rate risk 
the commercial bank offers a range of savings  now accounts  money market accounts  and cds  at competitive rates of interest to businesses and consumers  and solicits deposit relationships from government institutions located throughout the region we serve 
in addition  the commercial bank offers a variety of cash management and demand deposit products  as well as individual retirement accounts and other qualified plan accounts 
the commercial bank currently does not accept brokered deposits 
cds in excess of  are accepted by both the community bank and the commercial bank  and typically feature preferential rates of interest 
our ability to attract and retain deposits depends on various factors  with competition  industry consolidation  and the level of short term interest rates at the top of the list 
we vie for deposits and customers by placing an emphasis on convenience and service  with community bank locations  commercial bank locations  and hour atms 
our customers also have hour access to their accounts through our bank by phone service  and through our web site  www

in addition to traditional branches and three customer service centers  our community bank has branches that are located in store 
our in store branches represent the largest supermarket banking franchise in the new york metropolitan region  and one of the largest in the northeast 
because of their proximity to our traditional community bank branches  our in store branches enable us to offer to hours of service a week  in many of the communities we serve 
this service model is a key component of our efforts to attract and maintain deposits in a highly competitive marketplace 
we also compete by providing a broad selection of traditional banking products  complemented by an extensive menu of alternative financial services 
in addition to checking and savings accounts  cds  and iras  we offer a variety of third party investment products  including insurance  annuities  and mutual funds 
in addition  our practice of originating loans through a third party mortgage provider enables us to offer our customers a multitude of one to four family mortgage and home equity loans 
as a result of these factors  as well as the benefit of our significant community presence  the community bank is the second largest thrift depository in richmond  nassau  and queens counties  with market shares of   and  respectively 
the community bank also enjoys a significant share of deposits in several other densely populated markets  including of deposits in bayonne  new jersey 
market share information was provided by snl financial and is based on deposits held at june  borrowed funds borrowed funds totaled billion and billion  respectively  at december  and  and consisted of wholesale borrowings  in the form of fhlb ny advances and repurchase agreements  as well as junior subordinated debentures  senior debt  and preferred stock of subsidiaries 
the community bank and the commercial bank are members of the fhlb ny  and each of them has a line of credit with the fhlb ny 
pursuant to a blanket collateral agreement  our fhlb ny advances and overnight line of credit borrowings are secured by a pledge of certain eligible collateral  including loans  securities  and equity shares in certain of our subsidiaries 
repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the banks with an agreement to repurchase those securities at an agreed upon price and date 
our repurchase agreements are collateralized by us government agency obligations and mortgage related securities  and may be entered into with the fhlb ny or with a select number of wall street brokerage firms 
the brokerage firms we utilize are subject to an ongoing financial review to ensure that we borrow funds only from those dealers whose financial strength will minimize the risk of principal loss due to default 
this review is performed internally and or by qualified third parties 
in addition  a public securities association master repurchase agreement must be executed and on file for each brokerage firm we use 
at december   we recorded wholesale borrowings of billion  representing a modest increase from billion at december  fhlb ny advances represented billion and billion  respectively  of the year end and totals  while repurchase agreements represented billion and billion  respectively 
the level of wholesale borrowings largely reflects our use of such funds to support the record volume of loan production 
in addition  the long island financial transaction contributed million to the balance of wholesale borrowings at december  the modest rise in wholesale borrowings is also indicative of our year long emphasis on diversifying our funding sources to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment 
in further support of this objective  we extended billion of wholesale borrowings to an average call date of two years with an average cost of over the course of in addition to wholesale borrowings  the year end balance of borrowed funds included junior subordinated debentures of million of which million were acquired in the long island financial transaction and other borrowings  consisting of senior debt and preferred stock of subsidiaries  of million
