strayer university derives approximately of its revenue from tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students make payment arrangements for the tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
when students register for courses  tuition is recorded as unearned tuition  and is recognized in the quarter of instruction 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition depending on when the withdrawal occurs 
tuition revenue is shown net of any refunds  withdrawals or corporate discounts 
beginning in the first quarter  the company began recording employee tuition discounts and scholarships and awards as a reduction to revenue 
the university also derives revenue from other sources such as application fees  commencement fees  placement test fees  withdrawal fees  loan service and origination fees  and other income which are recognized when incurred 
beginning in the first quarter of  the company began recording textbook related income as revenue 
interest earned on the company s student loan portfolio and income generated from the sale of its student loans are recorded as revenue as well 
at the time of registration  unearned tuition a liability is recorded for academic services to be provided and a tuition receivable is recorded for the portion of the tuition not paid upfront in cash 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  tuition receivable at the end of any calendar quarter largely represents student tuition due for the following academic quarter 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due for students who have left the university is charged against the allowance 
our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
strayer university s expenses consist of instruction and educational support expenses  selling and promotion expenses  and general and administration expenses 
instruction and educational support expenses generally contain items of expense directly attributable to the educational activity of the university 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits of faculty and academic administrators 
instruction and educational support expenses also include costs of educational supplies and facilities  including rent for campus facilities  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories and all other physical plant and occupancy costs  with the exception of costs attributable to the corporate offices 
selling and promotion expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment  admissions  retention  promotion and development  as well as costs of advertising and production of marketing materials 
general and administration expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in management  student services  accounting  human resources  compliance and other corporate functions  along with the occupancy costs attributable to such functions 
bad debt expense is also included as a general and administration expense 
investment and other income consists primarily of earnings and realized gains or losses on investments 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to its allowance for uncollectible accounts  income tax provisions  valuation of deferred tax assets and accrued expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
tuition revenue is deferred at the time of registration and is recognized as income  net of any refunds or withdrawals  in the respective quarter of instruction 
advance registrations for the next quarter are recorded as unearned tuition 
we record estimates for our allowance for uncollectible accounts for tuition receivable from students 
if the financial condition of our students were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition payable to us  additional allowances may be required 
we record estimates for our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities may be required 
results of operations in  the company generated million in revenue  a increase compared to  primarily as a result of average enrollment growth of 
although tuition increased in  revenue per student increased affected by a mix shift to graduate students who  on average  take fewer classes than undergraduate students

new campuses the company s goal is to serve the demand for post secondary adult education by opening new campuses every year with eight new campuses planned for 
the company s objective is to become a nationwide university 
a new campus typically requires up to million in upfront capital costs for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computer equipment 
in the first year of operation  assuming a midyear opening  the company expects to incur operating losses of about million including depreciation related to capital costs described above 
a new campus is typically expected to begin generating operating income on a quarterly basis after four to six quarters of operation  generally upon reaching an enrollment level of about students 
the company s new campus notional model assumes an increase of average enrollment by students per year until reaching a level of about  students 
given the potential internal rate of return achieved with each new campus an estimated  opening new campuses is an important part of the company s strategy 
the company believes it has sufficient capital resources from cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operating activities to continue to open new campuses for at least the next months 
in  the company opened five new campuses two in tampa  florida for the spring term  one in greensboro  north carolina and one in columbia  south carolina for the summer term  and one in atlanta  georgia  its third campus in that market  for the fall term 
in the prior year  the company opened five new campuses as well  two in georgia and one each in south carolina  tennessee and pennsylvania 
the company opened two new campuses for winter term one in wilmington  delaware and the other in philadelphia  pennsylvania its fourth in that location and two new campuses in pittsburgh  pa for the spring term 
the company is planning to open an additional four campuses in year ended december  compared to year ended december  enrollment

these expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in largely attributable to both marketing costs and staffing costs growing faster than tuition revenue 
general and administration expenses 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was principally due to increased employee compensation and related expenses at both corporate and campus locations and higher bad debt expense  which increased million and million  respectively

this was partly offset by a lower effective tax rate of in  compared to in  resulting primarily from higher income from tax exempt securities 
net income 
net income increased million  or  from million in to million in because of the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  enrollment

gain on sale of asset 
in the third quarter of  the company sold its washington  dc campus building for million million net of selling expenses and signed a lease for space in a nearby building 
this transaction resulted in a gain of million before tax 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million  or  from million in to million in due to the aforementioned factors 
investment and other income 
investment and other income decreased million  or  from million in to million in beginning in the first quarter of  the company began recording textbook related income as revenue which  in  was million and was treated as investment and other income 
the decrease is also attributable to a shift of underlying investments from a short term corporate bond fund and money market fund to a short term tax exempt bond fund and tax exempt money market funds which had lower yields and a million gain before tax on the sale of marketable securities in  partly offset by a higher average cash balance 
provision for income taxes 
income tax expense increased million  or  from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in income before taxes attributable to the factors discussed above 
this was partly offset by a lower effective tax rate of in  compared to in  resulting primarily from investments in tax exempt securities 
net income 
net income increased million  or  from million in to million in because of the factors discussed above 
seasonality our quarterly results of operations tend to vary significantly within a year because of student enrollment patterns 
enrollment generally is highest in the fourth quarter  or fall term  and lowest in the third quarter  or summer term 
in  enrollments at the beginning of the winter  spring  summer and fall academic terms were    and  respectively 
costs generally are not affected by the seasonal factors as much as enrollment and revenue  and do not vary significantly on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth our revenues on a quarterly basis for the years ended december   and quarterly revenues dollars in thousands
