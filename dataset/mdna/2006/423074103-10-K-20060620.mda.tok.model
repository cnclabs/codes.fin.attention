item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the hj heinz company has been a pioneer in the food industry for years and possesses one of the world s best and most recognizable brands heinz 
while the company has prospered for a long time  we are constantly finding new ways to capitalize on emerging consumer trends and better methods of doing business 
over the past several years  we have been making great progress in simplifying and focusing the company on our core businesses 
this strategic transformation has been a long journey that began with the spin off of our non core us businesses in december  and has continued throughout fiscal  culminating with the recently completed sales of our european seafood and new zealand poultry businesses 
we are very pleased that the portfolio realignment portion of the transformation strategy is now virtually finished 
we have a few  non core  geographically isolated divestitures to complete  but with the majority of divestitures behind us  we can now sharpen our focus on growing our three core categories of ketchup sauces  meals snacks and infant food  where we have competitive advantages and leadership positions 
the portfolio realignment has resulted in the divesture of approximately non core product lines businesses and has generated proceeds of approximately billion 
more than of sales are in our three core categories and approximately of sales are generated by our top brands  making heinz one of the most focused companies in the packaged food industry 
progress update over the past several years  the results of our strategic transformation have established a much stronger foundation upon which we believe the company is positioned to build consistent  sustainable growth 
under this plan  we successfully divested non core us businesses in a billion  tax free spin off in fiscal this simplified our us business and enabled us to upgrade talent  processes and systems 
we have driven growth through innovation in the iconic heinz ketchup brand  smart ones nutritional meals  ore ida frozen potatoes and classico pasta sauces 
implemented a similar transformational plan in our pacific operations of australia and new zealand 
in these two business units  the company simplified the structure  upgraded talent  streamlined processes and accelerated innovation 
as a consequence  sales have grown at double digit rates and operating profits in the pacific operations have more than doubled from fiscal through from fiscal through  we have significantly outpaced the industry in working capital efficiency improvements  by lowering our cash conversion cycle by days to days for fiscal we also maintained capital spending at an average rate of of sales  one of the lowest in the industry 
acquired highly targeted businesses to further strengthen our leadership position in the three core categories  including the petrosoyuz condiments and sauces business in russia and the iconic hp and lea perrins sauces brands 
returned over billion to shareholders over the last four years through the dividend derived from the spin off to del monte  the annual dividend program and share repurchases 
as a result of all these actions  we believe heinz has become a stronger and more focused company
