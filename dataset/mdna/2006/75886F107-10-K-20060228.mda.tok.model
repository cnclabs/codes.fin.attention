item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
we are currently focused on three clinical development programs vegf trap in oncology  vegf trap eye in eye diseases using intraocular delivery  and il trap in certain systemic inflammatory indications 
the vegf trap oncology development program is being developed jointly with the sanofi aventis group under a september collaboration agreement 
our preclinical research programs are in the areas of oncology and angiogenesis  ophthalmology  metabolic and related diseases  muscle diseases and disorders  inflammation and immune diseases  bone and cartilage  pain  and cardiovascular diseases 
we expect that our next generation of product candidates will be based on our proprietary technologies for developing traps and human monoclonal antibodies 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates and may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  and source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of the vegf trap eye and il trap  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs  continue our research and development programs  and commercialize product candidates that receive regulatory approval  if any 
also  our activities may expand over time and require additional resources  and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from collaborators 
as a company that does not expect to generate product revenues or profits over the next several years  management of cash flow is extremely important 
the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in  our research and development expenses totaled million 
we expect these expenses to increase in  depending on the progress of our clinical programs 
the principal sources of cash to date have been sales of common equity and convertible debt and funding from our collaborators in the form of up front payments  research progress payments  payments for our research and development activities  and purchases of our common stock 
we also receive payments for contract manufacturing 
a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was compared to in and in in  we expect our annual average headcount to decrease to approximately  primarily as a result of reductions made in the fourth quarter of and planned for mid the workforce reductions  which we announced in september  are associated with narrowing the focus of our research and development efforts  substantial improvements in manufacturing productivity  the june expiration of our collaboration with procter gamble  and the expected completion of contract manufacturing for merck in late 
table of contents the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our clinical programs  key events in and plans for are as follows product candidate events events plans vegf trap oncology sanofi aventis reaffirmed their commitment to the collaborative development of the vegf trap in oncology reported positive preliminary results of phase trial utilizing intravenous injections initiated three phase studies of the vegf trap in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens initiate two additional safety and tolerability studies of the vegf trap in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens initiated phase study of the vegf trap as a single agent in non small cell lung adenocarcinoma initiate two efficacy safety studies of the vegf trap as a single agent in advanced ovarian cancer and symptomatic malignant ascites initiate two efficacy safety studies of the vegf trap in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with different cancer types finalize plans with the nci to sponsor up to ten exploratory efficacy safety studies evaluating the vegf trap in a variety of cancer types vegf trap eye reported positive results from phase trial in patients with the neovascular form of age related macular degeneration wet amd utilizing intravenous infusions initiated phase study in patients with wet amd utilizing local delivery by intravitreal injections reported positive preliminary results from phase study in patients with wet amd utilizing local delivery by intravitreal injections initiate a phase  part b study in patients with wet amd  comparing safety  tolerability  and biological activity of the vegf trap eye to macugen initiate phase clinical trial in wet amd utilizing intravitreal injections il trap completed safety and tolerability studies of il trap at higher doses complete efficacy portion of pivotal study in caps initiated exploratory proof of concept trial in polymyalgia rheumatica pmr initiated exploratory proof of concept trial in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis sjia evaluate other indications for the il trap 
table of contents product candidate events events plans il trap continued successfully completed initial treatment phase of proof of concept study in cias associated periodic syndrome caps initiated pivotal study in caps discontinued development of il trap in adult rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis collaborations our major collaboration agreements with sanofi aventis  novartis pharma ag  and the procter gamble company are summarized below 
the sanofi aventis group in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals inc now a member of the sanofi aventis group to collaborate on the development and commercialization of the vegf trap in all countries other than japan  where we retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the vegf trap 
sanofi aventis made a non refundable up front payment of million and purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
in january  we and sanofi aventis amended our collaboration agreement to exclude rights to develop and commercialize the vegf trap for intraocular delivery to the eye 
in connection with this amendment  sanofi aventis made a million non refundable payment to us 
in december  we and sanofi aventis amended our collaboration agreement to expand the territory in which the companies are collaborating on the development of the vegf trap to include japan 
as a result  the collaboration now includes joint development of the vegf trap throughout the world in all indications  except for intraocular delivery to the eye 
in connection with this amendment  sanofi aventis agreed to make a million non refundable up front payment to us  which was received in january we may also receive up to million in milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to five vegf trap indications in japan and a royalty of approximately on annual sales of the vegf trap in japan  subject to certain potential adjustments 
under the collaboration agreement  as amended  we and sanofi aventis will share co promotion rights and profits on sales  if any  of the vegf trap outside of japan  for disease indications included in our collaboration 
we may also receive up to million in additional milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals  including up to million in milestone payments for up to eight vegf trap indications in the united states or the european union 
in december  we earned a million payment from sanofi aventis  which was received in january  upon the achievement of an early stage clinical milestone 
regeneron has agreed to continue to manufacture clinical supplies of the vegf trap at our plant in rensselaer  new york 
sanofi aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the vegf trap 
under the collaboration agreement  as amended  agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by sanofi aventis 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi aventis for of these development expenses  including of the million payment received in connection with the january amendment to our collaboration agreement  in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and japan royalties  or at a faster rate at our option 
since inception of the collaboration through december   we and sanofi aventis have incurred million in agreed upon development expenses related to the vegf trap program 
in addition  if the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product for intraocular delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product under the collaboration by 
table of contents two years  we will begin reimbursing sanofi aventis for up to million of vegf trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial vegf trap sale under the collaboration occurs 
sanofi aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice 
upon termination of the agreement for any reason  any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi aventis for of the vegf trap development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to the vegf trap 
novartis pharma ag in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the il trap 
novartis made a non refundable payment of million and purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
il trap development expenses incurred in were shared equally by regeneron and novartis 
we funded our share of development expenses through loans from novartis 
in march  novartis forgave its outstanding loans to us totaling million  including accrued interest  based on regeneron s achieving a pre defined development milestone  which was recognized as a research progress payment 
in february  novartis provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint development of the il trap  and subsequently paid us million to satisfy its obligation to fund development costs for the nine month period following its notification and for the two months prior to that notice 
all rights to the il trap have reverted to regeneron 
in addition  we recognized contract research and development revenue of million  which represents the remaining amount of the march up front payment from novartis that had previously been deferred 
under the collaboration agreement  we retain the right to elect to collaborate in the future development and commercialization of a novartis il antibody  which is in clinical development  and novartis has the right to elect to collaborate in the development and commercialization of our second generation il trap  should we decide to develop this product candidate 
the procter gamble company in may  we entered into a long term collaboration agreement with procter gamble to discover  develop  and commercialize pharmaceutical products 
in connection with the collaboration  procter gamble agreed to provide funding in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration 
effective december   we and procter gamble entered into a new long term collaboration agreement  replacing the companies agreement 
the new agreement extended procter gamble s obligation to fund our research under the new collaboration agreement through december  with no further research obligations by either party thereafter 
we and procter gamble divided rights to the programs from the collaboration agreement that were no longer part of the companies collaboration 
under the december agreement  research support from procter gamble was million per quarter  plus annual adjustments for inflation  through december in june  we and procter gamble amended our december collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the modified agreement  the two companies agreed that the research activities being pursued under the collaboration agreement were completed on june   six months prior to the december  expiration date in the collaboration agreement 
procter gamble agreed to make a one time million payment to regeneron  which was received in july  and to fund our research under the agreement through the second quarter of we agreed to pay procter gamble approximately million to acquire certain capital equipment owned by procter gamble and located at our facilities 
we and procter gamble divided rights to research programs and preclinical product candidates that were developed during the research term of the collaboration 
neither party has the right to participate in the development or commercialization of the other party s product candidates 
we are entitled to receive royalties based on any future product sales of a procter gamble preclinical candidate arising from the collaboration 
neither party is entitled to receive either royalties or other payments based on any other products arising from the december collaboration agreement 
accounting for stock based employee compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  effective january   we have been 
table of contents recognizing expense  in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments including stock option awards on their date of grant  over the vesting period of the awards 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation expense for a all share based payments granted on or after january   including replacement options granted under our stock option exchange program which concluded on january  and b all awards granted to employees prior to january  that were unvested on that date 
prior to the adoption of the fair value method  we accounted for stock based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  compensation expense related to employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period prior to the first quarter of and prior period operating results have not been restated 
for the year ended december   non cash stock based employee compensation expense related to stock options awards stock option expense totaled million  of which million was recognized in operating expenses and million was capitalized in inventory 
assumptions we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option granted under the regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc long term incentive plan 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility  which is re evaluated at least quarterly  has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with option grants with similar exercise prices 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes the weighted average values of the assumptions we used in computing the fair value of option grants during  and expected volatility expected lives from grant date years years years dividend yield risk free interest rate changes in any of these estimates may materially affect the fair value of stock options granted and the amount of stock based compensation recognized in any period 
results of operations non gaap financial measures as described above  effective january   regeneron began recognizing stock option expense in accordance with sfas in each of the categories of expense in our statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas  stock option expense was not reflected in operating expenses and prior period operating results have not been restated 
the discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december  and includes certain financial measures that are calculated in a manner different from generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are considered non gaap financial measures under united states securities and exchange commission sec rules 
these non gaap financial measures for the year ended december  are pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share basic and diluted  exclusive of stock option expense  and research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  and contract manufacturing expenses  all exclusive of stock option expense 
our management does not intend that the presentation of non gaap financial measures be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap 

table of contents our management believes that the non gaap financial measures described above present helpful information to investors and other users of regeneron s financial statements by providing greater transparency about the nature of and trends in our operating expenses and net income loss and a more useful basis for comparing our operating results for the years ended december  and in addition  regeneron s management uses non gaap financial measures which exclude stock option expense internally for operating  budgeting  and financial planning purposes 
in our discussion below we have included tables which provide a reconciliation of the differences between these non gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
years ended december  and net income loss regeneron reported a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared with net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for excluding stock option expense  regeneron had a pro forma net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in as follows net loss per share for the year ended december  net loss basic and diluted in millions  except per share data net loss  as reported add stock option expense pro forma net loss  exclusive of stock option expense revenues revenues for the years ended december  and consist of the following in millions contract research development revenue sanofi aventis novartis procter gamble other total contract research development revenue research progress payments sanofi aventis novartis total research progress payments contract manufacturing revenue total revenue our total revenue decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to lower revenues related to our collaboration with sanofi aventis on the vegf trap and the absence in the period of revenues related to our collaboration with novartis on the il trap which ended in collaboration revenue earned from sanofi aventis and novartis is comprised of contract research and development revenue and research progress payments 
contract research and development revenue  as detailed below  consists partly of reimbursement for research and development expenses and partly of the recognition of revenue related to non refundable  up front payments 
non refundable up front payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over

since the first quarter of  we have not received  and do not expect to receive  any further contract research and development revenue from novartis 
contract research and development revenue earned from procter gamble also decreased in compared to  resulting from the june amendment to our december collaboration agreement with procter gamble  as described above under collaborations the procter gamble company 
under the terms of the modified agreement  procter gamble funded regeneron s research for the first two quarters of  compared with a full year of collaborative research funding in we do not expect to receive any further contract research and development revenue from procter gamble 
in december  we earned a million research progress payment from sanofi aventis  which was received in january  upon achievement of an early stage vegf trap clinical milestone 
in march  novartis forgave all of its outstanding loans  including accrued interest  to regeneron totaling million  based upon regeneron s achieving a pre defined il trap development milestone 
these amounts were recognized as research progress payments in contract manufacturing revenue relates to our long term agreement with merck  which expires in october  to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility 
contract manufacturing revenue decreased to million in from million in  principally due to a decrease in product shipments to merck in compared to revenue and the related manufacturing expense are recognized as product is shipped  after acceptance by merck 
included in contract manufacturing revenue in and are million and million  respectively  of deferred revenue associated with capital improvement reimbursements paid by merck prior to commencement of production 
this deferred revenue is being recognized as product is shipped to merck based on the total amount of product expected to be shipped over the term of the agreement 
in february  we agreed to extend the manufacturing agreement by one year through october as a result  in we began recognizing the remaining deferred balance of merck s capital improvement reimbursements as of december   which totaled million  as revenue as product is shipped to merck  based upon merck s order quantities through october

in  had we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of sfas  stock option expense would have totaled million 
the decrease in total stock option expense of million in was partly due to lower exercise prices of annual employee option grants made by us in december in comparison to the exercise prices of annual grants in recent prior years 
exercise prices of these option grants were generally equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the decrease in stock option expense in was also due  in part  to the exchange of options by eligible employees in connection with our stock option exchange program in january  as the unamortized fair value of the surrendered options on the date of the exchange is being recognized as stock option expense over a longer time period the vesting period of the replacement options in accordance with sfas research and development expenses research and development expenses  exclusive of stock option expense  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the following table summarizes the major categories of our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  expenses as stock option expenses exclusive of expenses as research and development expenses reported expense stock option expense reported in millions payroll and benefits clinical trial expenses clinical manufacturing costs research and preclinical development costs occupancy and other operating costs total research and development represents the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research  preclinical development  and clinical trials  including related payroll and benefits  manufacturing materials and supplies  depreciation  and occupancy costs of our rensselaer manufacturing facility

table of contents payroll and benefits  exclusive of stock option expense  increased million in from due primarily to wage and salary increases  higher employee benefit costs  and severance costs totaling million in associated with our workforce reduction plan that we initiated in october clinical trial expenses increased million in from due primarily to higher il trap costs associated with commencing clinical studies in new indications and discontinuing the phase b study in adult rheumatoid arthritis 
clinical manufacturing costs  exclusive of stock option expense  decreased million in from  as lower costs in related to manufacturing clinical supplies of the vegf trap and the il trap were partly offset by higher costs related to manufacturing clinical supplies of the il trap

change in classification we have revised in our previously issued financial statements included in this report on form k the classification of our investments in auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
auction rate securities are securities that have stated maturities beyond three months  but are priced and traded as short term investments due to the liquidity provided through the auction mechanism that generally resets interest rates every or days 
the change in classification resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and corresponding increase in short term marketable securities at each balance sheet date 
in addition  we revised our statements of cash flows included in this report on form k to reflect the purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
this change in classification had no impact on our previously reported current assets  net income loss  or cash flows from operations

in connection with our collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis to jointly develop and commercialize the vegf trap  we have received up front payments of million in september and million in january which was receivable at december  
both up front payments were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as contract research and development revenue ratably over the period during which we expect to perform services 
in and  we recognized million and million of revenue  respectively  related to these up front payments and we anticipate  based on current vegf trap product development plans  that we will recognize approximately million of revenue over each of the next years and approximately million for the subsequent years 
under the collaboration agreement  agreed upon worldwide development expenses incurred by both companies under the agreement will be funded by sanofi aventis 
sanofi aventis funded million  million  and million  respectively  of our vegf trap development costs in   and  of which million  million  and million  respectively  were included in accounts receivable as of december    and in both and  we made two semi annual interest payments totaling million per year on our convertible senior subordinated notes

in accordance with our collaboration agreement with novartis  we elected to fund our share of il trap development expenses through a loan that was forgiven by novartis in march  as described above 
in the first quarter of  we drew million  excluding interest  against this loan facility for expenses incurred during collaboration with the sanofi aventis group under our collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis  as described under collaborations above  agreed upon worldwide vegf trap development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical drug supply  will be funded by sanofi aventis 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will be obligated to reimburse sanofi aventis for of these development expenses  including of the million payment received in connection with the january amendment to our collaboration agreement  in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits and japan royalties  or at a faster rate at our option 
in addition  if the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product for intraocular delivery to the eye predates the first commercial sale of a vegf trap product under the collaboration by two years  we will begin reimbursing sanofi aventis for up to million of vegf trap development expenses in accordance with a formula until the first commercial vegf trap sale under the collaboration occurs 
since inception of the collaboration agreement through december   we and sanofi aventis have incurred million in agreed upon development expenses related to the vegf trap program 
we and sanofi aventis plan to initiate in multiple additional clinical studies to evaluate the vegf trap as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies in various cancer indications 

table of contents sanofi aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice 
upon termination of the agreement for any reason  any remaining obligation to reimburse sanofi aventis for of the vegf trap development expenses will terminate and we will retain all rights to the vegf trap 
severance costs in september  we announced plans to reduce our workforce by approximately employees in connection with narrowing the focus of our research and development efforts  substantial improvements in manufacturing productivity  the june expiration of our collaboration with procter gamble  and the expected completion of contract manufacturing for merck in late the majority of the headcount reduction occurred in the fourth quarter of  with the remainder planned for following the completion of our contract manufacturing activities for merck 
costs associated with the workforce reduction are comprised principally of severance payments and related payroll taxes  employee benefits  and outplacement services 
termination costs related to workforce reductions were expensed in the fourth quarter of  and included million of non cash expenses due to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock held by affected employees 
estimated termination costs associated with the planned workforce reduction in were measured in october and are being expensed ratably over the expected service period of the affected employees in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we estimate that total costs associated with the and planned workforce reductions will approximate million  of which million was charged to expense in and approximately million will be recognized as expense in we anticipate cost savings of approximately million in resulting from the implementation of our workforce reduction plans 
convertible debt in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement and received proceeds  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and out of pocket expenses  of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature in the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may redeem some or all of the notes if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
as part of this transaction  we pledged million of us government securities which was sufficient upon receipt of scheduled principal and interest payments to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due  the last of which was paid in october capital expenditures our additions to property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in in  we expect to incur approximately to million in capital expenditures which primarily consists of equipment for our manufacturing  development  and research activities 
funding requirements our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately  million 
we have entered into various agreements related to our activities to develop and commercialize product candidates and utilize our technology platforms  including collaboration agreements  such as those with sanofi aventis  novartis  and procter gamble  and agreements to use our velocigene tm technology platform  such as our agreement with serono sa we incurred expenses associated with these agreements  which include an allocable portion of general and administrative costs  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
we currently anticipate that approximately of our expenditures for will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  
table of contents including the vegf trap  vegf trap eye  and il trap  approximately of our expenditures for will be applied to our basic research activities and the continued development of our novel technology platforms  and the remainder of our expenditures for will be used for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for leases and long term debt 
none of these obligations extend beyond years 
payments due by period less than to total one year years in millions convertible senior subordinated notes payable operating leases includes amounts representing interest 
excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
in connection with certain clinical trial contracts with service providers  we may incur early termination penalties if the contracts are cancelled before agreed upon services are completed 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of our collaboration with sanofi aventis 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at least mid however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to sell  in one or more offerings  up to million of equity or debt securities  together or separately  which registration statement was declared effective in february however  there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could harm our business 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
during the third quarter of  we elected to change the method we use to recognize revenue under sab related to non refundable collaborator payments  including up front licensing payments  payments for development activities  and research progress milestone payments  to the substantive milestone method  adopted retroactively to january  under this method  for non refundable up front license payments that are not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone or for which an estimated level of required effort is not available  we recognize revenue ratably over the estimated period of time during which we expect to perform services under the agreement based on research and development plans 
these estimated time periods are updated based on the results and progress of our research and development activities and revisions to these estimates could result in changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future 
in addition  if a collaborator terminates the agreement in accordance with the terms of the contract  we would recognize the remainder of the up front payment at the time of the termination 
payments for development activities are recognized as revenue as earned  over the period of effort 
payments which are based on achieving a specific substantive performance milestone  involving a degree of risk  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due and non refundable  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone  a reasonable amount of time has passed between receipt of an up front payment and achievement of the milestone  and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort  value  and risk associated with achieving the milestone 
previously  we had recognized revenue from non refundable collaborator payments based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete  and total expected contract revenue 
however  the revenue recognized was limited to the amount of non refundable payments received 
the change in accounting method was made because we believe that it better reflects the substance of our collaborative agreements and is more consistent with current practices in the biotechnology industry 
in connection with our vegf trap collaboration agreement with sanofi aventis  we received non refundable up front payments of million in september at the collaboration s inception and million in january in connection with the december amendment to the collaboration agreement to include japan 
these up front payments were recorded to deferred revenue and are being recognized as contract research and development revenue over the period over which we are obligated to perform services 
also  in connection with our collaboration agreement with novartis  in the first quarter of  novartis provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint development of the il trap 
accordingly  the remaining balance of the million up front payment  or million  was recognized as contract research and development revenue 
recognition of deferred revenue related to contract manufacturing agreement we have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with merck under which we manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility and perform services 
we recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the product is tested and approved by  and shipped fob shipping point to  merck  and as services are performed 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to modify portions of our rensselaer facility to manufacture merck s vaccine intermediate and merck agreed to reimburse us for the related capital costs 
these capital cost payments were deferred and are recognized as revenue as product is shipped to merck  based upon our estimate of merck s order quantities each year through the expected end of the agreement which  for and prior years  was october since we commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in november  our estimates of merck s order quantities each year have not been materially different from merck s actual orders 
in february  we agreed to extend the manufacturing agreement by one year through october as a result  in we began recognizing the remaining deferred balance of merck s capital improvement reimbursements as of december   which totaled million  as revenue as product is shipped to merck  based upon merck s order quantities through october 
table of contents clinical trial accrual estimates for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs  which are included in research and development expenses  are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical trial 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
no material adjustments to our past clinical trial accrual estimates were made during the years ended december    and depreciation of property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts  and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
the estimated useful lives of property  plant  and equipment are as follows building and improvements years laboratory and computer equipment years furniture and fixtures years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
costs of construction of certain long lived assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
stock based employee compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  effective january   we have been recognizing expense  in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments including stock option awards on their date of grant  over the vesting period of the awards 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation expense for a all share based payments granted on or after january   including replacement options granted under our stock option exchange program which concluded on january  and b all awards granted to employees prior to january  that were unvested on that date 
prior to the adoption of the fair value method  we accounted for stock based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
therefore  compensation expense related to employee stock options was not reflected in operating expenses in any period prior to the first quarter of and prior period operating results have not been restated 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option granted under the regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc long term incentive plan 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of our common stock price  ii the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise expected lives  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv risk free interest rates  which are based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options expected lives 
expected volatility  which is re evaluated at least quarterly  has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options expected lives 
expected lives are principally based on our limited historical exercise experience with option grants with similar exercise prices 
the 
table of contents expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation which we adopted effective january   and supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions  and requires the recognition of compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment including stock options and restricted stock issued to employees 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in march  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the application of sfas r 
among other things  sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations as well as the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we are required to adopt sfas r effective for the fiscal year beginning january   and intend to do so using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on a the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in addition  we will consider the guidance of sab as we adopt sfas r 
although the impact of adopting sfas r has not yet been quantified  management believes that the adoption of this standard may have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas replaces apb  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of a change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas  as applicable  beginning january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate  asset backed  and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimated that a one percent change in interest rates would result in changes in the fair market value of our investment portfolio of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the impact of an interest rate change at december   compared to december   is due primarily to the shorter duration of our investment portfolio at the end of
