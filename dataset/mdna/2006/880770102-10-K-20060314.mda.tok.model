item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information contained in this document  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  made pursuant to section e of the exchange act  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of teradyne s plans  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
teradyne s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in item a risk factors and elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations and financial condition 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition in accordance with the guidance provided by the commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne s customers upon shipment 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 
for equipment that includes software that is incidental to the product  revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of new products  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of teradyne 
teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
teradyne s post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customer s ability to use the product 
teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin teradyne s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
teradyne does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products 
for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement  all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
inventories inventories  which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value 
teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
equity incentive and stock purchase plans for periods prior to  teradyne accounts for its equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb 
teradyne s employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan 
teradyne s equity incentive plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb accordingly  there has been million of expense in related to restricted stock units 
teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
see note b accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information 
teradyne implemented the expense recognition provisions of the fasb s new standard  sfas r  beginning with the first quarter of its fiscal year that began on january  for the years ended december   and  had sfas r been effective  teradyne would have recognized additional non cash equity based compensation expense in continuing operations of million  million  and million  respectively  applying the provisions of sfas on may   the board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding  unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees  officers and other eligible participants under teradyne s various stock option plans 
the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of  the closing price of teradyne s common stock on the new york stock exchange on may  and ranged in exercise price from to per share 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable immediately and teradyne reduced the compensation expense it otherwise would have been required to record under sfas r by approximately million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years  and income taxes on a quarterly basis  teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of its review undertaken at december   teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions  most notably the united states 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at december  and teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists  including sustained profitability  that realization is more likely than not 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of teradyne s use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

bookings teradyne s net orders for its three reportable segments for  and are as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems the decrease in semiconductor test systems bookings from to was driven by less demand from our subcon customers  primarily in the first half of as they experienced lower capacity utilization 
the second half of showed a increase over the first half  however  with a surge in demand in the automotive disk storage  game processors  performance consumer and wireless markets 
although total semiconductor test systems bookings declined from to  flex bookings increased over during this period 
orders in the assembly test systems segment were flat from to orders in the assembly test systems segment increased from to  primarily due to the net increases in the mil aero business and increased orders of in circuit products 
the growth in these areas was offset by a decline in orders resulting from the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines in the other test systems bookings increase from to was due primarily to a large project booked in the second half of by a major customer in our diagnostic solutions business 
other test systems bookings are program related and can have significant fluctuations from period to period 
teradyne s order cancellations and backlog adjustments for its three reportable segments for the last three years are as follows in millions semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems semiconductor test systems experienced million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in approximately of this amount was related to cancellations  while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to management s estimate of what may be canceled in future periods 
teradyne s net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows united states south east asia europe singapore taiwan japan rest of the world for the past three years  teradyne s backlog of unfilled orders for its three reportable segments is as follows in millions semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice  subject to possible cancellation penalties 
in   and there were no significant cancellation penalties received 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period 
delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue teradyne s net revenue for its three reportable segments for  and is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems the reduction in bookings at our subcon customers in the semiconductor test systems segment in the second half of drove the decrease in revenue in the first half of the bookings reduction was primarily the result of lower utilization of teradyne testers at our subcon customers 
the second half of showed sales only slightly lower than comparable levels 
assembly test systems sales and other test system sales were flat from to the increase in assembly test systems sales from to was due to increases in both the commercial and mil aero businesses 
commercial business growth was due to increased sales of in circuit test products  while the increase in mil aero sales was generated by a number of large projects which were undertaken in these increases were offset  in part  by decreases from the sale of the manual x ray  rework and automated optical inspection aoi product lines in teradyne s three reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years semiconductor test systems assembly test systems other test systems teradyne s net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows south east asia united states europe singapore taiwan japan rest of the world teradyne s product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change product revenue service revenue service revenue is derived from the servicing of teradyne s installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts  repairs  extended warranties  parts sales and applications support 
in the past three years  no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated net revenue 
in   and  teradyne s three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for  and of consolidated net revenue  respectively 
gross margin point change point change dollars in millions gross margin percent of total revenue the decrease in gross margin from to was the result of several factors 
a reduction in semiconductor test systems sales volume contributed points  a million inventory provision recorded in semiconductor test systems for the write down of excess non flex inventory contributed points  and a shift in product mix within semiconductor test contributed points 
these decreases were offset in part by lower variable employee compensation which contributed point 
the gross margin improvement of points from to was a result of several factors 
an improvement of points is due to a volume increase from year to year  coupled with lower fixed manufacturing costs  primarily resulting from past restructuring actions 
an additional points can be attributed to a more favorable mix of revenues  with higher margin configurations as well as more product revenue  as product margins are higher than service margins 
higher variable compensation expense in had a point unfavorable impact on margins year over year 
the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows point change point change dollars in millions product gross margin percent of product revenue point change point change dollars in millions service gross margin percent of service revenue we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions 
forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand 
this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory 
obsolete inventory  which represents items for which there is no demand  is fully reserved 
excess inventory  which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters  is written down to estimated net realizable value 
these write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components 
sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision  which is recorded in cost of revenues 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of revenues of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test systems including a million provision for the write down of excess non flex inventory  million related to assembly test systems and million related to other test systems 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of revenues of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test systems  million related to assembly test systems and million related to other test systems 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to assembly test systems  which included million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing  distributing and primary support of the aoi product line  million related to semiconductor test systems soc parts and components and million related to other test systems 
during the years ended december   and  teradyne sold inventory that was previously reserved which had a favorable gross margin impact of million  million and million  respectively 
teradyne scrapped million  million  and million of inventory which had been previously written down or written off during the years ended december   and  respectively 
teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 
as of december  and  teradyne had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of million and million  respectively 
of the reserves at december   million  million  million  and million relate to inventory provisions recorded in    and prior to  respectively 
engineering and development change change dollars in millions engineering and development percent of total revenue during  teradyne reduced its levels of investment in engineering and development spending 
more than of teradyne s total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment  where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between and million 
during  semiconductor test systems completed its ultraflex platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its flex test platform ultraflex and flex which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures 
during and  semiconductor test systems reduced the number of platforms under major development  which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms 
the consolidation of multiple product divisions within semiconductor test systems into one group in enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation 
the decrease of million in engineering and development spending from to consists of the following amounts million decrease due to the completion of the flex test platform engineering work  million decrease due to variable employee compensation  and million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending 
the increase of million in engineering and development spending from to consisted of the following amounts million increase due to the development of the flex test platform  million increase due to variable employee compensation  and million increase in travel and training costs  these increases were offset in part by the following million decrease in salaries and fringe benefits due to a decrease in headcount  offset in part by salary increases effective july   and million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending  including a decrease of million in accelerated depreciation related to asset writedowns and facility closures in selling and administrative change change dollars in millions selling and administrative percent of total revenue the decrease in selling and administrative spending of million from to is due primarily to an million decrease in variable compensation  offset by a million increase in sales support spending for the flex platform and a million increase in salaries and fringe benefits due to salary increases 
the increase in spending of million from to was principally due to the following approximate amounts million increase due to variable employee compensation  million from an increase in consulting expenses  and million increase in travel and training costs  these increases were offset in part by the following million in lower depreciation costs due to asset writedowns and capital spending cutbacks  and million decrease in rental and lease payments due to consolidation of facilities 
restructuring and other charges in response to a downturn in the industry  teradyne initiated restructuring activities in across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies  principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations 
further actions were initiated in  to a lesser extent in  and in the tables below represent activity related to these actions 
the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employee compensation and withholdings 
the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms  the latest of which expires in teradyne expects to pay out approximately million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months

interest income and expense change change in millions interest income interest expense the increase in interest income from to was primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates 
the increase in interest income from to was due primarily to an increase in interest rates in the latter half of and increased cash balances throughout the decrease in interest expense from to was due primarily to the repurchase of million and million of teradyne s senior convertible notes the notes in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily attributable to the prepayment of teradyne s california mortgage of million in the third quarter of which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of and all of  as well as the repurchase of million of the notes in the third quarter of other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  for the years ended december    and includes the following income expense in thousands gain on sale of investment collection of loan other than temporary impairment of common stock investment fair value adjustment on warrants mortgage prepayment penalty other than temporary impairment of investment total gain on sale of an investment in common stock

the change to an income position from a loss position from to was mainly attributable to increased sales in the semiconductor test systems segment  as well as continued cost reductions throughout teradyne 
income taxes during  the income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled million 
under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  a benefit of million was recognized for losses related to current year continuing operations  as a result of the sale of connection systems 
there was an equal and offsetting tax provision in the gain on sale of connection systems included in discontinued operations 
the remaining portion of the net tax benefit includes a tax provision of million that related primarily to foreign taxes 
for the years ended december  and  tax expense relates primarily to a tax provision for foreign taxes 
tax expense for also included an irs settlement related to the closing out of tax years through during  teradyne utilized previously reserved net operating losses to reduce taxable income and lower the effective tax rate 
teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in until sufficient positive evidence exists  including an appropriate level of profitability  teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  teradyne maintained its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  and teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists  including sustained profitability  that realization is more likely than not 
as of december   teradyne had million of us federal operating loss carryforwards 
the effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table reflects teradyne s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period purchase obligations non cancelable lease commitments interest on debt convertible senior notes pension funding notes payable other debt total in thousands beyond total minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases

the uses of cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by a decrease of million in inventory 
changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of million in primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrual balances of million 
investing activities consist of purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  proceeds from the sale of businesses  proceeds from asset disposals  proceeds from the sale of product lines  cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures decreased by million in compared to additions of internally constructed systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the semiconductor test systems segment accounted for approximately million of the decrease in capital expenditures 
additions of internally constructed systems peaked in  due to the introduction of the flex test platform 
the remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne 
capital expenditures increased by million in compared to  due primarily to additions of internally constructed systems to support the introduction of the flex test platform  and to a lesser extent due to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment to support the increase in revenues in and continued investment in research and development 
investing activities of the discontinued operation provided million of cash in in november of  teradyne sold connection systems to amphenol corporation for net proceeds of million 
financing activities include sales of teradyne s common stock  as well as repayments of debt 
during  and  repayments of long term debt used cash of million  million and million  respectively  as teradyne repurchased a portion of its outstanding notes in the first and fourth quarters of and the third quarter of  and prepaid its mortgage on its california properties in the third quarter of during  and  issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated million  million  and million  respectively 
on october   teradyne issued million principal amount of the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of million 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
teradyne began making annual interest payments of million  paid semi annually  on the notes commencing on april  the notes are senior unsecured obligations of teradyne that rank equally with teradyne s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
in the event of a change in control by which teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party  the holders of the notes may be able to require teradyne to redeem some or all of the notes either in discounted teradyne common stock or in cash 
on february   the commission declared effective a registration statement on form s covering both the notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted 
on or after october   teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below 
the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of principal amount  is as follows for the designated periods period redemption price beginning on october  and ending on october  beginning on october  and ending on october  thereafter  teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a price equal to of the principal amount 
on august   the board of directors of teradyne authorized management to repurchase up to million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below of the principal amount 
the board subsequently amended its authorization on october  to authorize repurchases through open market purchases  privately negotiated transaction  auctions  by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by teradyne s ceo or cfo  at prices below of the principal amount 
the million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of and the first and fourth quarters of to repurchase million  million and million of the notes  respectively 
the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the return teradyne would earn on high grade investment securities 
as a result of the repurchases  teradyne s interest payments for the notes in are expected to be million 
on january   management was given further authorization by the board of directors to repurchase up to the full million of the principal amount that remains outstanding under the notes through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon 
pursuant to the new board resolutions  on february   teradyne repurchased million of the notes 
as of february   million of the principal amount of the notes remain outstanding 
there are a number of factors that will affect the timing of when and the amount of the notes that management may elect to repurchase  including the price of the available notes  teradyne s available cash and marketable securities  prevailing interest rates  and teradyne s anticipated liquidity needs 
if  at some point in the future  teradyne s stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately per share  management may elect to convert a portion of the notes into equity  to avoid the continuation of interest payments and to conserve capital 
however  there can be no assurance that even if teradyne s stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the notes will convert into equity as teradyne s stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date 
if this were to occur  teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the notes called into cash 
there are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including teradyne s stock price  teradyne s available cash and marketable securities and teradyne s anticipated liquidity needs 
teradyne believes its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
teradyne plans to contribute approximately million in to teradyne s us qualified pension plan which is currently under funded 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
retirement plans teradyne s pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan  certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december   which was of teradyne s cost of revenue and operating expenses 
the largest portion of teradyne s pension expense was million for its us qualified pension plan including a curtailment charge of million related to the sale of connection systems  which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets for teradyne s us qualified pension plan assets of 
in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption  teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
teradyne also considered its historical year compounded return of for the period ending december   which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
based on these historical returns  teradyne believes that was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust these returns as necessary 
the current asset allocation for teradyne s us qualified pension plan is invested in equity securities and invested in fixed income securities  which is in accordance with the plan s asset allocation requirements 
teradyne s actual asset allocation as of december  was virtually identical to its asset allocation model 
teradyne s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with teradyne s targeted allocations 
teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december   under the us qualified pension plan  teradyne had cumulative gains of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index formerly salomon brothers pension liability index  which was at at december   down from at december  as a result  teradyne selected for its december  discount rate  which was down from as of december  each year teradyne considers the citigroup pension liability index  along with other indices including the moody s aa rated corporate bond yield and the citigroup year aaa aa rate 
the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities is approximately years  which matches the duration of the citigroup pension liability index 
teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the pension expense estimates are based on a discount rate 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in teradyne s pension plans 
teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december   if teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions teradyne s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible 
the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
the value of teradyne s us qualified pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  teradyne contributions and investment performance returns have decreased the deficit of teradyne s us qualified pension plan  net of benefit obligations  from million at december  to million at december  during  teradyne contributed million to the us qualified pension plan 
teradyne plans to contribute approximately million in to this plan

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities  rated aa or higher  which have minimal credit risk 
teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management teradyne regularly enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro  great britain pound  japanese yen and the taiwan dollar 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce teradyne s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december  and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
since the notes were out of the money at december   they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on these bases  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of december  and  respectively
