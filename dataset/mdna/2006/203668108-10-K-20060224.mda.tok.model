item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
executive overview we are the largest non urban provider of general hospital healthcare services in the united states in terms of number of facilities and net operating revenues 
we generate revenue by providing a broad range of general hospital healthcare services to patients in the communities in which they are located 
we are paid for our services by governmental agencies  private insurers and directly by the patients we serve 
during we accomplished the following items  each of which demonstrates the continued execution of our operating strategy and or our efforts to maximize shareholder value 
each of these accomplishments should be considered in conjunction with our discussion of operating results  liquidity and capital resources 
acquired five hospitals  sold four under performing hospitals and allowed one hospital lease to expire pursuant to its terms  identified one under performing hospital as a candidate for disposition  called for redemption all of our outstanding convertible notes of which million was converted by the note holders into  shares of our common stock in december and million of which was converted by the note holders into  shares of our common stock in january  with only a total of million being redeemed for cash  and entered into a group purchasing agreement with healthtrust purchasing group lp for the year ended december   we generated billion in net operating revenues  a growth of over the year ended december   and million of net income  an increase of over the year ended december  for the year ended december   admissions at hospitals owned throughout both periods increased and adjusted admissions increased 
in september  the gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana were hit by two severe hurricanes 
these hurricanes did not have a material effect on volumes or operating results of the company 
this growth represents the achievement of our strategic growth objectives of both growing through acquisitions and expanding and improving our services 
of the five hospitals acquired in  three were not reflected in our consolidated operating results until the beginning of our fourth quarter 
on a pro forma annual basis  had all acquisitions been completed on the first day of our fiscal year  these acquisitions represent the acquisition of approximately million in net operating revenue 
we believe there continues to be ample opportunity for growth in substantially all of our markets by decreasing the need for patients to travel outside their communities for health care services 
furthermore  we continue to strive to improve operating efficiencies and procedures in order to improve our profitability at all of our hospitals 
approximately of our net operating revenues in were generated from hospitals we acquired from january through october since we estimate that it may take up to five years for a newly acquired hospital to fully benefit from our ownership  we believe there continues to be greater opportunity for these more recently acquired hospitals to contribute improvements in growth and profitability to our consolidated results 
we have continued to generate strong cash flows as evidenced by the million of cash flows from operations for the year ended december   an increase of over the prior year 
this cash flow was generated primarily from the profitability of our operations  excluding non cash expenses  with the remainder being substantially the result of our management of working capital 
these cash flows  along with the cash on hand at the beginning of the year and cash received from the sale of hospitals  allowed us to fund all acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment without the need to borrow under our credit agreement 
in addition  in  we generated million of 
table of contents cash flow from financing activities resulting from employees exercising stock options 
since the exercise of options results in the issuance of additional shares of common stock  we used this cash  along with an amount equivalent to the tax benefit derived from the exercise of stock options  to repurchase additional shares under our stock repurchase program  thereby minimizing the impact on our weighted shares outstanding 
acquisitions and dispositions effective january   the lease of scott county hospital  a bed facility located in oneida  tennessee  expired pursuant to its terms 
effective march   we completed the acquisition of an controlling interest in chestnut hill hospital  a bed hospital located in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the aggregate consideration for our interest in the hospital totaled approximately million  of which million was paid in cash and million was assumed in liabilities

the aggregate consideration for this hospital totaled approximately million  of which million was paid in cash and million was assumed in liabilities 
pursuant to this agreement we are required to build a replacement hospital by june  on september   we completed the acquisition of the assets of newport hospital and clinic located in newport  arkansas 
this facility  which was previously operated as an bed acute care general hospital  was closed by its former owner simultaneous with this transaction 
the operations of this hospital have been consolidated with harris hospital  also located in newport  which is owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the aggregate consideration for this hospital totaled approximately million in cash 
effective october   we completed the acquisition of two hospitals under separate transactions from local not for profit corporations 
bradley memorial hospital  a licensed bed hospital located in cleveland  tennessee was acquired for an aggregate consideration of approximately million  of which million was paid in cash and million was assumed in liabilities 
sunbury community hospital  a licensed bed hospital located in sunbury  pennsylvania was acquired for an aggregate consideration of approximately million  of which million was paid in cash and million was assumed in liabilities 
in addition  as part of our ongoing strategic review  we decided during the second quarter of to market highland medical center in lubbock  texas for sale 
we anticipate this disposition will be completed by june   which is within twelve months of the date this hospital was designated as held for sale 

table of contents sources of revenue the following table presents the approximate percentages of net operating revenue received from medicare  medicaid  managed care  self pay and other sources for the periods indicated 
the data for the years presented are not strictly comparable due to the significant effect that hospital acquisitions have had on these statistics 
year ended december  medicare medicaid managed care self pay other third party payors total net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost based reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in the periods that such adjustments become known 
adjustments related to final settlements or appeals that increased revenue were insignificant in the years ended december   and in the future  we expect the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program to increase due to the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatient acute services are based on a prospective payment system  depending upon the diagnosis of a patient s condition 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
reductions in the rate of increase in medicare reimbursement may cause our net operating revenue growth to decline 
effective april   centers for medicare and medicaid services implemented changes to the medicare outpatient prospective patient system 
also  beginning april   and extending through march   the consolidated appropriations resolution of and the temporary assistance for needy families block grant extension equalized the rural and urban standardized payment amounts under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system 
along with other changes  this benefit was made permanent when congress passed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of while the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of provides a broad range of provider payment benefits  federal government spending in excess of federal budgetary provisions considered in passage of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of could result in future deficit spending for the medicare system  which could cause future payments under the medicare system to decline 
in addition  specified managed care programs  insurance companies  and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals 
the trend toward increased enrollment in managed care may adversely effect our net operating revenue growth 
results of operations our hospitals offer a variety of services involving a broad range of inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical services 
these include orthopedics  cardiology  occupational medicine  diagnostic services  emergency services  rehabilitation treatment  home health  and skilled nursing 
the strongest demand for hospital services generally occurs during january through april and the weakest demand for these services occurs during the summer months 
accordingly  eliminating the effect of new acquisitions  our net operating revenues and earnings are historically highest during the first quarter and lowest during the third quarter

of the increase in net operating revenues from hospitals owned throughout both years  we estimate approximately was attributable to increases in rates  acuity level of services provided  and government reimbursement  and was attributable to volume increases in both inpatient and outpatient services 
net operating revenues from volume increases were primarily the result of newly acquired facilities 
net operating revenues attributable to rates and acuity level of services were primarily the result of the recruitment of physician specialists and the addition of new services

as described more fully in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   the company had certain cash obligations  which are due as follows in thousands total and thereafter long term debt senior subordinated notes convertible notes capital leases total long term debt operating leases replacement facilities and other capital committments open purchase orders total represents the principal amount of the notes redeemed for cash as part of the december  call for redemption 
as part of an acquisition in  we agreed to build a replacement hospital in petersburg  virginia within five years 
the state of virginia has approved the plans for this replacement hospital 
as part of an acquisition in we agreed to build a replacement hospital in shelbyville  tennessee by june  as required by an amendment to our lease agreement entered into in  we agreed to build a replacement hospital at our barstow  california location 
construction costs for these replacement facilities are currently estimated to be approximately million 
in addition as a part of an acquisition in  we committed to spend million in capital expenditures within eight years in phoenixville  pennsylvania  and as part of an acquisition in we committed to spend approximately million within seven years related to capital expenditures at chestnut hill hospital in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
also  in  we entered into an agreement with a developer to build and lease to us a new corporate headquarters  we have an option to acquire the building at the end of these amounts include the remaining amount of capital to be spent 
open purchase orders represent our commitment for items ordered but not yet received 
as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december   we had issued letters of credit primarily in support of potential insurance related claims and specified outstanding bonds of approximately million 
primarily as a result of our redemption of million of principal amount of convertible notes in along with current year net income for  our debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased from at december  to at december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from million during to million during this increase is the result of an increase in net income and non cash expenses  including depreciation and amortization of million  as compared to the prior year  an increase in cash flow from accounts receivable of million resulting primarily from not buying accounts receivables in our acquisitions and the resulting accounts receivable build up during  and an increase in cash flow of million from improving our 
table of contents collection efforts and reducing days revenue outstanding 
these improved cash inflows were offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes of million  an increase in cash paid for employee compensation liabilities of million  which resulted primarily from a timing difference of the and year end pay periods  and the impact of other working capital changes  which resulted in net cash outflow of million 
the use of cash in investing activities decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of facilities of million during offset by an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during as compared to cash used to purchase property and equipment included million for the construction of replacement facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million from million in to million in in august   we completed a refinancing of our previous credit facility with a billion senior secured credit facility 
the facility consists of a billion term loan with a final maturity of and a million revolving credit facility that matures in primarily as a result of the repurchase of  shares of our common stock  for which we borrowed under our senior secured credit facility to complete and subsequently paid off with proceeds from our million senior subordinated notes offering in december  our debt as a percentage of total capitalization increased from at december  to at december  capital expenditures cash expenditures for purchases of facilities was million in  million in and million in our expenditures in included million for the purchase of the five hospitals  million for the purchase of an ambulatory surgery center and physician practices and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals in our capital expenditures in included million for the purchase of two hospitals and a surgery center in one of our current markets  and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the acquired hospitals in our capital expenditures in included million for the ten hospitals acquired in  million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the acquired hospitals in excluding the cost to construct replacement hospitals  our cash expenditures for capital for totaled million compared to million in  and million in costs to construct replacement hospitals totaled million in  million in  and million in total additions to capital in including million related to the construction of the new corporate headquarters and other amounts for which cash has not yet been expended  were million

in addition  we have entered into an agreement with a developer to build a new corporate headquarters to be completed in we will account for this project as if we own the assets 
estimated construction costs of the new corporate headquarters are approximately million of which approximately million has been incurred through december  we expect total capital expenditures of approximately to million in  including approximately to million for renovation and equipment purchases which includes amounts which are required to be expended pursuant to the terms of the hospital purchase agreements and approximately to million for construction and equipment cost of the replacement hospitals and corporate headquarters 

table of contents capital resources net working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase was attributable primarily to an increase in cash balance  supplies and accounts receivable in and a decrease in employee compensation accruals and other accrued liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts payable and employee compensation accruals due primarily to the timing of year end payments and the addition of five hospitals during on november   we elected to call for the redemption of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due the notes on december  at the conclusion of this call for redemption  million in principal amount of the notes were redeemed for cash and million of the notes called for redemption  plus an additional million of the notes  were converted by the holders into  shares of our common stock 
on december   we elected to call for redemption all of the remaining outstanding notes 
as of december   there was million in aggregate principal amount outstanding 
on january   at the conclusion of the second call for redemption of notes  million in principal amount of the notes were redeemed and million of the notes were converted by the holders into  shares of our common stock prior to the second redemption date 
on august  and subsequently amended on december  and july   we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility with a consortium of lenders 
this facility replaced our previous credit facility and consists of a billion term loan with a final maturity in as opposed to under our previous facility and a million revolving tranche that matures in we may elect from time to time an interest rate per annum for the borrowings under the term loan  and revolving credit facility equal to a an alternate base rate  which will be equal to the greatest of i the prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus basis points the abr  plus basis points for the term loan and the applicable margin for revolving credit loans or b the eurodollar rate plus basis points for the term loan and the eurodollar applicable margin for revolving credit loans 
the applicable margin varies depending on the ratio of our total indebtedness to annual consolidated ebitda  ranging from to for alternate base rate loans and from to for eurodollar loans 
we also pay a commitment fee for the daily average unused commitments under the revolving tranche 
the commitment fee is based on a pricing grid depending on the applicable margin for eurodollar revolving credit loans and ranges from to 
the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears and on the revolving credit termination date with respect to the available revolving credit commitments 
in addition  we will pay fees for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility 
the purpose of the facility was to refinance our previous credit agreement  repay other indebtedness  and fund general corporate purposes including to declare and pay cash dividends to repurchase shares or make other distributions  subject to certain restrictions 
as of december   our availability for additional borrowings under our revolving tranche was million of which million is set aside for outstanding letters of credit 
we also have the ability to add up to million of securitized debt and million additional term loans under our agreement  which we have not yet accessed 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate under our credit agreement was 
the terms of the credit agreement include various restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness  liens  investments  asset sales  capital expenditures  sale and leasebacks  contingent obligations  transactions with affiliates  dividends and stock repurchases and fundamental changes 
we would be required to amend the existing credit agreement in order to pay dividends to our shareholders in excess of million 
the covenants also require maintenance of various ratios regarding consolidated total indebtedness  consolidated interest  and fixed charges 
as of december  we are a party to eight separate interest swap agreements to limit the effect of changes in interest rates on a portion of our long term borrowings 
under one agreement  effective november   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in november under a second agreement  effective june   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in june under a third agreement  effective june   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in june under a fourth agreement  effective october   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on 
table of contents million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in october under a fifth agreement  effective august   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in august under a sixth agreement  effective may  and expiring may  we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
under a seventh agreement  effective june  and expiring june  we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
under an eighth agreement  effective november  and expiring november  we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
we received a variable rate of interest on each of these swaps based on the three month london inter bank offer rate libor  excluding the margin paid under the senior secured credit facility on a quarterly basis  which is currently basis points for revolver loans and term loans under the senior secured credit facility 
we also were a party to an interest swap agreement with million notional amount of indebtedness and a fixed interest rate of that expired in november we believe that internally generated cash flows  availability for additional borrowings under our revolving tranche of million  the ability to add million of term loans and million of accounts receivable securitized debt  under our senior secured credit facility and continued access to the bank credit and capital markets will be sufficient to finance acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements through the next months 
we believe these same sources of cash flows  borrowings under our credit agreement as well as access to bank credit and capital markets will be available to us beyond the next months and into the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements included in our consolidated operating results for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively  of net operating revenue and million and million  respectively  of income from operations  generated from seven hospitals operated by us under operating lease arrangements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the respective assets and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
lease payments under these arrangements are included in rent expense and totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the current terms of these operating leases expire between june and december  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
if we allow the remainder of these leases to expire  we would no longer generate revenue nor incur expenses from these hospitals 
in the past  we have utilized operating leases as a financing tool for obtaining the operations of specified hospitals without acquiring  through ownership  the related assets of the hospital and without a significant outlay of cash at the front end of the lease 
we utilize the same operating strategies to improve operations at those hospitals held under operating leases as we do at those hospitals that we own 
we have not entered into any operating leases for hospital operations since december as described more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   the company has certain cash obligations for replacement facilities and other construction commitments of million and open purchase orders for million 
joint ventures we have from time to time sold minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing minority interest ownership positions 
this was the case with our acquisition of chestnut hill hospital in march  pursuant to which we acquired an interest with the remaining interest owned by the university of pennsylvania 
in our other joint ventures  physicians are the minority interest holders 
the amount of minority interest in equity is included in other long term liabilities and the minority interest in income or loss is recorded as an operating expense 
we do not believe these minority ownerships are material to our financial position or operating results 
as of and for the years ended december  and  the balance of minority interests included in long term liabilities was million and million  respectively  and the amount of minority interest in earnings was million and million  respectively 

table of contents reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which will continue to limit payment increases under these programs and in some cases implement payment decreases 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments might  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could cause our future financial results to decline 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  our suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have generally offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services  expanding services and reducing costs in other areas 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
third party reimbursement net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost based reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
contractual allowances are automatically calculated and recorded through our internally developed automated contractual allowance system 
within the automated system  actual medicare drg data  coupled with all payors historical paid claims data  is utilized to calculate the contractual allowances 
this data is automatically updated on a monthly basis and subjected to review by management to ensure accuracy and reasonableness 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings in the periods that such adjustments become known 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in future periods as final settlements are determined 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimates  actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to our hospitals patients 
collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and outstanding patient balances for which the primary insurance payor has paid and the remaining outstanding balance generally deductibles and co payments is owed by the patient 
at the point of service  for patients required to make a co payment  we generally collect less than of the related revenue 
for all procedures scheduled in advance  our policy is to verify insurance coverage prior to the date of the procedure 
insurance coverage is not verified in advance of procedures for walk in and emergency room patients 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by reserving as uncollectible all governmental and non governmental accounts over days from discharge 
collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
significant changes in payor mix  business office operations  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
generally  we do not provide specific reserves by payor category but estimate bad debts as a consolidated provision for total accounts receivable 
we believe our policy of reserving all accounts over days from discharge  without regard to payor class  has resulted in reasonable estimates determined on a consistent basis 
we believe that we collect substantially all of our third party insured receivables which includes receivables from governmental agencies 
since our methodology is not applied by individual payor class  reserving all amounts over days  which includes some accounts that are collectible  has provided us with a reasonable estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover all accounts receivable  including individual amounts in both the day and under and over day categories  that are uncollectible 
to date  we believe there has not been a material difference between our bad debt allowances and the ultimate historical collection rates on accounts receivables including self pay 
we review our overall reserve adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections as a percentage of trailing net revenue  as well as review for significant changes in payor mix and recent acquisitions or disposals 
our policy is to write off accounts receivable if the balance is under or when such amounts are placed with an outside collection agency 
we believe this policy accurately reflects the ongoing collection efforts within the company and is consistent with industry practices 
at december  and december  we had approximately and million  respectively  being pursued by various outside collection agencies 
of these aforementioned amounts  we expect to collect less than  net of estimated collection fees 
as these amounts have been written off  they are not included in our gross accounts receivable or our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  we take into consideration estimated collections of these amounts written off in evaluating the reasonableness of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
days revenue outstanding as presented in the following table as of the dates indicted fell within our target range for days revenue outstanding of days as of december  days revenue outstanding the reason our days revenue outstanding decreased from is from increased point of service collections and use of internal collection agency s enhanced technology to more quickly collect co insurance and deductibles 
the reason our days revenue outstanding decreased from is the following testing of electronic billing edits under hipaa beginning october  slowed our billing process for specified claims in  mutual of omaha  our sole medicare intermediary  went through a systems conversion in july  which delayed billing and collections of medicare claims  and large acquisitions in the second half of required medicare billing approvals and new medicaid provider numbers delaying our billing at those hospitals 
the following table is an aging of our gross prior to allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts accounts receivable in thousands 
table of contents balance as of as of december  as of december  days over days days over days total gross accounts receivable the approximate percentage of total gross accounts receivable prior to allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts summarized by aging categories is as follows as of december  days days days over days total the approximate percentage of total gross accounts receivable prior to allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts summarized by payor is as follows as of december  insured receivables self pay receivables total although we do not specifically maintain information for individual categories of self pay included in the percentage of self pay receivables shown in the table above  we estimate uninsured self pay receivables are approximately to  patient deductibles and co insurance after third party insurance payments are approximately to  and those insured patients billed directly because their insurance has not paid are approximately to 
those accounts that are being billed directly to patients because their third party insurance coverage has not paid are reclassed to self pay receivables from insured receivables generally after days from discharge in order to bill the patients directly and get them involved in assisting with the collection process from their third party insurance company 
none of these amounts represents a denial from commercial or other third party payors 
we estimate  on a historical basis  the uncollected portion of self pay receivables related to co insurance  co payments and deductibles ranges from to and the uncollected portion of self pay receivables related to uninsured patients ranges from to 
additionally  we estimate the uncollected portion of self pay receivables related to insured patients billed directly is insignificant 
in the aggregate  we expect the uncollectible portion of all self pay receivables  before recoveries of accounts previously written off  to be approximately to at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as reported in the consolidated financial statements at december  and represents approximately of self pay receivables as described above  net of allowances for other discounts 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill arising from business combinations is accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets and is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we selected september th as our annual testing date 

table of contents the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
we estimated the fair values of the related operations using both a debt free discounted cash flow model as well as an adjusted ebitda multiple model 
these models are both based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs  and are reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
we performed our initial evaluation  as required by sfas no 
 during the first quarter of and the annual evaluation as of each succeeding september no impairment has been indicated by these evaluations 
estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue and profitability projections or fair values  could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
professional liability insurance claims we accrue for estimated losses resulting from professional liability claims 
the accrual  which includes an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  is based on historical loss patterns and actuarially determined projections and is discounted to its net present value using a weighted average risk free discount rate of and in and  respectively 
to the extent that subsequent claims information varies from management s estimates  the liability is adjusted currently 
our insurance is underwritten on a claims made basis 
prior to june   substantially all of our professional and general liability risks were subject to a million per occurrence deductible  for claims reported from june  through june   these deductibles were million per occurrence 
additional coverage above these deductibles was purchased through captive insurance companies in which we had a minority ownership interest in each and to which the premiums paid by us represented less than of the total premium revenues of each captive insurance company 
with the formation of our own wholly owned captive insurance company in june  we terminated our minority interest relationships in those entities 
substantially all claims reported after june  and before june  are self insured up to million per claim 
substantially all claims reported on or after june  are self insured up to million per claim 
management on occasion has selectively increased the insured risk at certain hospitals based upon insurance pricing and other factors and may continue that practice in the future 
excess insurance for all hospitals was purchased through commercial insurance companies and generally covers us after the self insured amount up to million per occurrence for claims reported on or after june  the following table represents the balance of our liability for the self insured component of professional liability insurance claims and activity for each of the respective years listed excludes premiums for insured coverage in thousands claims and beginning expenses end of year paid expense of year total expense  including premiums for insured coverage  was million in  million in and million in income taxes we must make estimates in recording provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize these deferred tax assets  subject to the valuation allowance we have established 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns 

table of contents our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through fiscal year  which resulted in no material adjustments 
in february  we were notified by the internal revenue service of its intent to examine our consolidated tax return for we make estimates we believe are accurate in order to determine that tax accruals are adequate to cover any potential adjustments arising from tax examinations 
we believe the results of this examination will not be material to our consolidated statements of income or financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and supercedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
on april   the sec delayed adoption of sfas no 
r for certain registrants  including our company  to the first annual period beginning after july  in addition  sfas no 
r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r beginning january  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include a modified prospective and retroactive methods 
under the retroactive method  all prior periods presented would be restated 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards that subsequently vest or are modified after the beginning of the first period restated 
we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method for transition purposes 
compensation expense related to all currently outstanding equity based awards will be approximately million in  million in and million in additional compensation expense for awards made after the adoption of sfas no 
r will vary depending on many factors  including the number of awards granted  the market value of our stock on the date of grant and other variables used in determining the fair value of those options on the date of grant 
sfas no 
r also requires that the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as financing cash flows rather than as operating cash flows 
the requirement could reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what the future impact on our statement of cash flows will be because it depends on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
share based payment sab 
although not altering any conclusions reached in sfas no 
r  sab provides the views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and  among other things  provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we intend to follow the interpretive guidance on share based payments set forth in sab during our adoption of sfas no 
r 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which states that a company must recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
fin clarifies that conditional obligations meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and therefore should be recognized if their fair value is reasonably estimable 
we adopted fin as of december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position 
on november   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 application of fasb interpretation no 
to minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners fin 
fin amends fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to expand the scope to include guarantees granted to a business  such as a physician s practice  or its owner s  that the revenue of the business for a period will be at least a specified amount 
under fin  the accounting requirements of fin are effective for any new revenue guarantees issued or modified on or after january  and the disclosure of all revenue guarantees  regardless of whether they were recognized under fin  is required for all 
table of contents interim and annual periods beginning after january  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our senior secured credit facility which bears interest based on floating rates 
in order to manage the volatility relating to the market risk  we entered into interest rate swap agreements described under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in we utilize risk management procedures and controls in executing derivative financial instrument transactions 
we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations are used with the goal of mitigating a portion of the exposure when it is cost effective to do so 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for  million for  and million for
