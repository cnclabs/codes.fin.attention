item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
management overview our business involves marketing and underwriting commercial insurance in texas  new mexico  idaho  oregon  montana and washington  marketing and underwriting non standard personal automobile insurance in texas  new mexico and arizona  marketing of general aviation insurance in states effective january   claims administration  and other insurance related services 
we have pursued our business activities through subsidiaries whose operations are organized into our commercial insurance operation segment  which handles commercial insurance products and services  and our personal insurance operation segment  which handles non standard personal automobile insurance products and services 
we expect to realign our operational segments during to reflect the activities of newly acquired subsidiaries 
see  item business recent events 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  representing a increase over the million reported for the prior year 
on a diluted per share basis  net income was for the year ended december   compared with net income of per diluted share in the decrease in net income per diluted share was primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding to million diluted shares during  compared to million diluted shares during  primarily as a result of a successful stockholder rights offering completed in the second quarter of in accordance with sfas  we have restated the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for and prior years for the effect of a bonus element from our stockholder rights offerings that were successfully completed in and according to sfas  there is an assumed bonus element in a rights issue whose exercise price is less than the market value of the stock at the close of the rights offering period 
this bonus element is treated as a stock dividend for reporting earnings per share 
the increase in earnings in reflects increased investment income attributable to additional capital raised from our shareholder rights offering and issuance of trust preferred securities in the second quarter of the improvement in earnings also reflects additional profit sharing commission revenue in the commercial insurance operation due to favorable loss development in prior accident years  as well as improved loss experience on prior accident years in the personal insurance operation 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the significant accounting policies requiring our estimates and judgments are discussed below 
such estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  changes in laws and regulations  observance of industry trends and information received from third parties 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported consolidated financial statement amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
investments 
we complete a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether any decline in the fair value of any investment below cost is deemed other than temporary 
all securities with an unrealized loss are reviewed 
unless other factors cause us to reach a contrary conclusion  investments with a fair market value significantly less than cost for more than days are deemed to have a decline in value that is other than temporary 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is charged to earnings based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment  resulting in a new cost basis for the security 
risks and uncertainties are inherent in our other than temporary decline in value assessment methodology 
risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about financial condition or liquidity  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about future prospects  unfavorable changes in economic or social conditions and unfavorable changes in interest rates or credit ratings 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs mainly commission  underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and charged to operations over periods in which the related premiums are earned 
ceding commissions from reinsurers  which include expense allowances  are deferred and recognized over the period premiums are earned for the underlying policies reinsured 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and expected investment income on those unearned premiums  as computed on a product line basis 
we routinely evaluate the realizability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
at december  and  there was no premium deficiency related to deferred policy acquisition costs 
goodwill 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill of acquired businesses of approximately million 
this amount has been recorded as a result of prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas  which we adopted as of january   goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
we completed our annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
as required by sfas  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under sfas  fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
methods for estimating reporting unit values include market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
with the exception of market quotations  all of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions 
deferred tax assets 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred federal income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method  whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for tax rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided against our deferred tax asset to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be adequate to realize these future tax benefits 
this valuation allowance was  at december  and this valuation allowance was necessary due to the limitation imposed by section of the internal revenue code on utilizing the net operating loss acquired as part of the piic acquisition 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae are established for claims which have already been incurred by the policyholder but which we have not yet paid 
losses and lae represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through december  and the reserves for unpaid losses and lae are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
see  item business analysis of losses and lae and analysis of loss and lae reserve development 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the reserves for unpaid losses and lae are adequate 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating unpaid losses and lae  the actual ultimate amounts may differ from the recorded amounts 
a small percentage change could result in a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a change in december  unpaid losses and lae would produce a thousand change to pre tax earnings 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
such adjustments are included in current operations 
the range of unpaid losses and lae estimated by our actuary as of december  was million to million 
our best estimate of unpaid losses and lae as of december  is million 
our carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae as of december  is comprised of million in case reserves and million in incurred but not reported reserves 
in setting this estimate of unpaid losses and lae  we have assumed  among other things  that current trends in loss frequency and severity will continue and that the actuarial analysis was empirically valid 
in the absence of any specific factors indicating actual experience at either extreme of the actuarial range  we have established a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae which is approximately million higher than the midpoint of the actuarial range 
it would be expected that management s best extimate would move within the actuarial range from year to year due to changes in our operations and changes within the marketplace 
the actuarial range is determined independently of management s best estimate and is only used to check the reasonableness of that estimate 
there is no set method for determining ranges  and judgment enters into the process 
the range was estimated primarily by measuring the variability of loss development patterns over time within each line of business 
the results generated by multiple methods were also considered when determining the overall range 
in light of the inherent uncertainty in the reserve estimates there can be no assurance that the actual losses ultimately experienced will fall within the actuarial range 
however in light of the breath of the actuarial range  we believe that it is reasonably likely that actual losses will fall within such range 
our reserve requirements are also interrelated with product pricing and profitability 
we must price our products at a level sufficient to fund our policyholder benefits and still remain profitable 
because claim expenses represent the single largest category of our expenses  inaccuracies in the assumptions used to estimate the amount of such benefits can result in our failing to price our products appropriately and to generate sufficient premiums to fund our operations 
ceding commissions of the personal insurance operation 
under our reinsurance arrangements with dorinco prior to october   we earn ceding commissions based on dorinco s loss ratio ultimate losses and loss expenses incurred to earned premium experience on the portion of policies reinsured by dorinco 
we received a provisional commission as policies were produced as an advance against the later determination of the commission actually earned 
the ceding commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the provisional commission is adjusted periodically on a sliding scale based on expected loss ratios 
the following table details the ceding commission sensitivity to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty with dorinco at above and below the provisional loss ratio 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio ultimate loss ratio booked at effect of actual above provisional       effect of actual below provisional       recognition of profit sharing commission revenues of the commercial insurance operation 
profit sharing commission of the commercial insurance operation is calculated and recognized when the loss ratio  as determined by a qualified actuary  deviates from contractual targets 
we receive a provisional commission as policies are produced as an advance against the later determination of the profit sharing commission actually earned 
the profit sharing commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the provisional loss ratio 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio ultimate loss ratio booked to at effect of actual above provisional     effect of actual below provisional     liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds 
our sources of funds are from insurance related operations  financing activities and investing activities 
major sources of funds from operations include premiums collected net of policy cancellations and premiums ceded  commissions  and processing and service fees 
on a consolidated basis  our cash and investments increased million to million as of december  as compared to million at december  this increase is mostly attributable to net proceeds of million from a stockholder rights offering and million from the issuance of trust preferred securities during these amounts exclude restricted cash and investments of million and million at december  and  respectively  which secure the credit exposure of third parties arising from our various quota share reinsurance treaties and agency agreements 
net cash provided by our consolidated operating activities was million during compared to million during the increase in operating cash flow primarily resulted from increased premiums collected of million due largely to the assumption from clarendon of business produced by hga and the issuance of ahic policies for business produced by hga since july  also contributing to the increase in collected premium is the retention of the texas non standard auto premium produced by pga 
prior to october   we retained only of this business 
partially offsetting the increased operating cash flow is a million increase in paid operating expenses due mostly to additional ceding commissions paid to clarendon for the assumed premium  paid incentive compensation and paid retail agent profit sharing commissions 
also partially offsetting the increased operating cash flow is a million increase in paid loss and loss adjustment expenses due mostly to the ahic direct and assumed business produced by hga during the last half of as well as the retention of the texas non standard auto premium produced by pga 
additional paid interest of million from the trust preferred securities and million in additional tax deposits also partially offset the increase in collected premium 
cash used by investing activities during was million as compared to million used during the increase in cash used in investing activities is mainly due to increased purchases of debt and equity securities of million  increased net purchases of short term investments of million  a decrease in net maturities and redemptions of securities of million and a million increase in cash and investments transferred to restricted accounts 
cash provided by financing activities during was million as compared to cash used in financing activities of million during the cash provided in was from net proceeds of million from the stockholder rights offering  million from the issuance of trust preferred securities net of debt issuance costs and million from the exercise of stock options 
the cash used in was from million repaid on a note payable that was partially offset by thousand in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
as a holding company  hallmark is dependent on dividend payments and management fees from its subsidiaries to meet operating expenses and debt obligations 
as of december   hallmark had million in cash and invested assets 
cash and invested assets of our non insurance subsidiaries were million as of december  property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the state of texas are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any twelve month period  without the prior written consent of tdi  to the greater of statutory net income for the prior calendar year or of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
dividends may only be paid from unassigned surplus funds 
during  ahic s ordinary dividend capacity was million 
piic  domiciled in arizona  is limited in the payment of dividends to the lesser of of prior year policyholder s surplus or prior year s net investment income  without prior written approval from azdoi 
during  piic s ordinary dividend capacity was million 
neither ahic nor piic paid a dividend to hallmark during the maximum dividend that ahic can pay hallmark in without prior approval from tdi is million 
the maximum dividend that piic can pay hallmark in without prior approval from azdoi is million 
tdi regulates financial transactions between ahic and affiliated companies 
applicable regulations require tdi s approval of management fees  expense sharing contracts and similar transactions 
pga paid million and million in management fees to hallmark during and  respectively 
azdoi regulates financial transactions between piic and affiliated companies 
applicable regulations require azdoi s approval of management fees  expense sharing contracts and similar transactions 
piic paid million in management fees to pga during each of and statutory capital and surplus is calculated as statutory assets less statutory liabilities 
tdi requires that ahic maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus of million and azdoi requires that piic maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus of million 
as of december   ahic and piic each significantly exceeded the minimum required statutory capital and surplus 
at december   ahic reported statutory capital and surplus of million  which reflects an increase of million from the million reported at december  at december   piic reported statutory capital and surplus of million  which is million more than the million reported at december  ahic reported a statutory net loss of million during compared to statutory net income of million in the net loss was primarily due to the statutory recognition of acquisition costs from the retention of business produced by hga 
these costs are deferred over the life of the underlying policies under gaap 
piic reported statutory net income of million during compared to million in at december   ahic s premium to surplus percentage was as compared to for the year ended december  piic s premium to surplus percentage was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  credit facility 
on june   we entered into a credit facility with the frost national bank 
the credit agreement was amended on july   and was further amended and restated on january  the restated credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility  with a million letter of credit sub facility 
the borrowings under the revolving credit facility will accrue interest at an annual rate of three month libor plus and we will pay letter of credit fees at the rate of per annum 
our obligations under the restated credit agreement are secured by a security interest in the capital stock of all of our subsidiaries  guaranties of all of our subsidiaries and the pledge of substantially all of our assets subject to applicable insurance law and regulations 
the restated credit agreement contains covenants which  among other things  require us to maintain certain financial and operating ratios and restrict certain distributions  transactions and organizational changes 
as of december   there were no outstanding amounts due under our credit facility  and we were in compliance with or had obtained waivers of all of our covenants 
in the third quarter of  we issued a million letter of credit under the sub facility to collateralize certain obligations under the agency agreement between hga and clarendon effective july  in january   we borrowed million under the revolving credit facility in connection with the tga acquisition 
see  item business recent events 
trust preferred securities 
on june   our newly formed trust entity completed a private placement of million of year floating rate trust preferred securities 
simultaneously  we borrowed million from the trust subsidiary and contributed million to ahic in order to increase policyholder surplus 
the note bears an initial interest rate of until june   at which time interest will adjust quarterly to the three month libor rate plus percentage points 
under the terms of the note  we pay interest only each quarter and the principal of the note at maturity 
as of december   the note balance was million 
other debt obligations 
on january   we executed a promissory note payable to newcastle in the amount of million in order to obtain funding to complete the acquisition of aerospace 
the promissory note bears interest at per annum prior to maturity and at the maximum rate allowed under applicable law upon default 
interest is payable on the first business day of each month 
the principal of the promissory note  together with accrued but unpaid interest  is due on demand at any time after june on january   we issued million in subordinated convertible promissory notes to the opportunity funds 
each convertible note bears interest at per annum  which rate increases to per annum in the event of default 
interest is payable quarterly in arrears commencing march  principal and all accrued but unpaid interest is due at maturity on july  subject to shareholder approval  the convertible notes are convertible by the holders into approximately million shares of our common stock subject to certain anti dilution provisions  and will be automatically converted to such common stock at maturity 
long term contractual obligations 
set forth below is a summary of long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
amounts represent estimates of gross undiscounted amounts payable over time 
in addition  certain losses and lae are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and are therefore recoverable 
such potential recoverables are not reflected in the table 
estimated payments by period total after notes payable   interest on note payable      unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses     operating leases    conclusion 
based on budgeted and year to date cash flow information  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our projected insurance obligations  operational expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we expect additional capital to be required to satisfy the debt obligations to newcastle which are payable on demand after june  we presently intend to retire this debt through a rights offering of our common stock to existing shareholders during the first half of however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such rights offering 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal total revenues for increased million  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of a million increase in revenues from our commercial insurance operation due to the transition which began in the third quarter of of our premium produced by hga from clarendon to ahic 
income before tax for increased million over the improvement in operating earnings reflects additional investment income on capital raised in  the transition of the commercial business and improved underwriting results 
the following is additional business segment information for the twelve months ended december  and in thousands revenues personal insurance operation   commercial insurance operation   corporate consolidated   pre tax income personal insurance operation   commercial insurance operation   corporate   consolidated   personal insurance operation net premium written by our personal insurance operation increased million during to million compared to million during the increase was due mainly to ahic assuming of the texas non standard automobile business produced by ahga and underwritten by a third party  effective october  prior to october   ahic assumed only of this business 
total premium production for declined million  or  to million from the million produced in the decline in produced premium reflected increased rate competition 
revenue for our personal insurance operation increased to million for from million for increased net premium earned of million due to higher assumed premium volume was the primary cause of this increase 
also driving the increased revenue was a million increase in investment income due to an increase in the investment portfolio from the completion of our capital plan 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in ceding commission income resulting from ahic assuming of the texas non standard automobile business effective october  pre tax income for our personal insurance operation increased million  or  for compared to net investment income and realized gains and losses contributed million to the increase in pre tax income for over improved underwriting results as evidenced by a loss ratio of in as compared to in contributed million to the increase in pre tax income in taking into consideration the effect on ceding commissions  loss and lae and premium production costs  the changes in premium volume produced and assumed contributed approximately million to the increase in pre tax income 
lower technical service costs from integrating piic s back office systems that were previously outsourced contributed million and lower salary and related expenses contributed million to the increase in pre tax income 
commercial insurance operation beginning in the third quarter of  our commercial insurance operation began retaining written premium through ahic 
our commercial insurance operation written premium was accomplished through the assumption of in force policies from clarendon at july   the assumption of clarendon policies issued subsequent to july   and the issuance of ahic policies 
this resulted in net written premium of million for total revenue for our commercial insurance operation of million for was million more than the million reported in this increase in total revenue was primarily due to net premiums earned of million from the issuance of ahic policies and the assumption of premium from clarendon for business produced by hga 
increased net investment income contributed million to the increase in revenue 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million  in both cases due to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure 
total earned premium generated by our commercial insurance operation including premium retained by clarendon for was million as compared to million for pre tax income for our commercial insurance operation of million for increased million  or  over the million reported for increased revenue  as discussed above  was the primary reason for the increase in pre tax income  partially offset by loss and lae of million and additional production expenses of million caused by increased retail agent commissions from higher premium production as well as additional ceding commission expense from the assumption of premium from clarendon 
corporate corporate pre tax loss was million for as compared to million for the increase was due mostly to additional interest expense of million from the issuance of trust preferred securities in june  increased salary expense of million from increased headcount including the transfer of accounting positions from both operations to corporate late in and additional audit and legal fees of million due primarily to the implementation of our capital plan in fiscal versus fiscal total revenues for decreased million  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of a million decline in total revenues from our personal insurance operation partially offset by a million increase in total revenues from our commercial insurance operation 
however  income before tax and extraordinary gain for increased million as compared to the improvement in operating earnings in reflected better underwriting results for our personal insurance operation  additional commission revenue in our commercial insurance operation and an overall reduction in interest expense as a result of the repayment of a related party note in september the following is additional business segment information for the twelve months ended december  and in thousands revenues personal insurance operation   commercial insurance operation   corporate consolidated   pre tax income personal insurance operation   commercial insurance operation   corporate   consolidated  personal insurance operation net premiums written decreased million  or during to million compared to million in the decrease in net premiums written was primarily attributable to the cancellation of unprofitable agents and programs  a shift in marketing focus from annual term premium financed policies to six month term direct bill policies  a reduction in policy counts caused by targeted rate adjustments and increased competition from newly capitalized entities entering the marketplace 
net premiums earned decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of the decline in net premiums earned  total revenue for our personal insurance operation decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in although revenue for our personal insurance operation declined  our pre tax income increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to improved underwriting results  as evidenced by a loss and lae ratio of for as compared to for also contributing to the improved pre tax results were reduced salary and related expenses of million due to the successful integration of the piic operations in late and the overall reduction in premium volume and increased net investment income of million 
these improvements were partially offset by the discontinuation of the premium finance program which caused finance charge revenue to decrease by million which was partially offset by reduced interest expense of million 
commercial insurance operation total revenue for our commercial insurance operation of million for was million  or  more than the million reported for the improvement was primarily due to a million increase in commission revenue and a million increase in claim servicing revenue 
commercial premium volume growth was the primary cause of the increased commission and claim fee revenue for earned premium generated by our commercial insurance operation for was million compared to million for we did not bear the primary underwriting risk for this business in or and  therefore  the resulting premiums and claims are not reflected in our reported results 
pre tax income for the commercial insurance operation of million in increased million  or  over the million reported in increased revenue  as discussed above  was the primary reason for the increase in pre tax income  partially offset by additional compensation and production related costs of million attributable to the increased premium volume 
corporate corporate pre tax loss was million for as compared to million for we saved million in interest expense in due to the repayment of a related party note in september this was partially offset by a million increase in salary and related expenses in effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations  except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claim costs 
the effects of inflation are considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
the actual effects of inflation on results of operations are not known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to the upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we attempt to mitigate the effects of inflation in the pricing of policies and establishing loss and lae reserves 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk are the types of market risk to which we are principally exposed 
interest rate risk our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade  fixed income securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to these securities is interest rate risk 
in general  the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed income securities as of december  was million 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  was years 
should the market interest rates increase  the company s fixed income investment portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by  or million  representing the effective duration multiplied by the change in market interest rates 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in a  or million  increase in the market value of the fixed income investment portfolio 
credit risk an additional exposure to our fixed income securities portfolio is credit risk 
we attempt to manage the credit risk by investing only in investment grade securities and limiting our exposure to a single issuer 
as of december   our fixed income investments were in the following corporate securities  municipal securities  and us treasury securities 
as of december   all of our fixed income securities were rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurers to whom we have ceded underwriting risk 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage it assumes  we remain obligated to our policyholders in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
in order to mitigate credit risk to reinsurance companies  we use financially strong reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better 
equity price risk investments in equity securities which are subject to equity price risk make up of our portfolio 
the carrying values of equity securities are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the fair value of our equity securities as of december  was million 
the fair value of our equity securities would increase or decrease by million assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices as of the balance sheet date 
this would increase or decrease shareholders equity by 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what should be considered the best or worse case scenario
