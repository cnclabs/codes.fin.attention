we may be unable to successfully integrate our acquisition of certain assets from sci funeral services  inc or our other acquisitions with our operations or realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 
integration of the sci funeral services  inc businesses and operations that we acquired with our existing business and operations is a complex  time consuming and costly process  particularly given that the acquisition has significantly increased our size 
failure to successfully integrate the sci funeral services  inc businesses and operations with our existing business and operations in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
similarly  our ongoing acquisition program exposes us to integration risks as well 
the difficulties of combining the acquired operations include  among other things operating a significantly larger combined organization and integrating additional assets to our existing operations  coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel from diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  consolidating partnership  technological and administrative functions  integrating internal controls  compliance under the sarbanes oxley act of and other governance matters  
table of contents the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  customer or key employee loss from the acquired businesses  and potential environmental and regulatory liabilities and title problems 
in addition  we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of certain assets from sci funeral services  inc  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  for various reasons  including difficulties integrating operations and personnel and higher costs 
if the trend toward cremation in the united states continues  our revenues may decline which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we and other death care companies that focus on traditional methods of interment face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately of the united states death care market by the year  compared to approximately in because the products and services associated with a cremation  such as niches and urns  produce lower revenues than the products and services associated with a traditional interment  a continuing trend toward cremations may reduce our revenues and  therefore  our cash available for distribution 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and the trading price of our common units 
in mid  we began a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations  which require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
as indicated in part ii  item a controls and procedures below  in connection with our preparation of audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 
to remediate these material weaknesses  we have implemented a cemetery maintenance audit procedure related to our burial vault situation and restated our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas as described in part ii  item a controls and procedures  and our management believes that such actions will serve to remediate the identified material weakness 
management has also dedicated internal resources  engaged outside consultants and adopted a detailed work plan to i assess and document the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting  ii take steps to improve control processes  where appropriate  iii validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and iv implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting 
however  we cannot be certain that the foregoing measures and our remediation procedure will ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if compliance with policies or procedures deteriorate and we fail to correct any associated issues in the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud  current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and the trading price of our common units 
if we cannot meet nasdaq continued listing requirements  the nasdaq national market may delist our common units  which could negatively impact the price and liquidity of our common units as well as our ability to pursue our acquisition growth strategy 
on april   we received a nasdaq staff determination indicating that our common units are subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market in connection with our failure to timely file an annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  with the sec 
we have appealed the staff s determination to a 
table of contents nasdaq listing qualifications panel  and our hearing request stayed the delisting process pending the panel s decision 
even though our filing of this form k was only days after the extended due date of march   there can be no guaranty that the panel will grant our request for continued listing 
if the nasdaq national market delists our common units  it is likely to have an adverse impact on the price and liquidity of our common units 
in addition  if our common units are delisted  we may be less able to implement our acquisition growth strategy because we may have to refrain from making some acquisitions that we otherwise would finance  at least in part  with the issuance of common units or the proceeds of an offering of common units 
regulatory and legal risks our operations are subject to regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  including extensive regulations concerning trusts  pre need sales  cemetery ownership  marketing practices  crematories  environmental matters and various other aspects of our business 
if state laws or interpretations of existing state laws change or if new laws are enacted  we may be required to increase trust deposits or to alter the timing of withdrawals from trusts  which may have a negative impact on our revenues and cash flow 
we are required by state laws to deposit specified percentages of the proceeds from our pre need and at need sales of interment rights into perpetual care trusts and proceeds from our pre need sales of cemetery products and services into merchandise trusts 
these laws also determine when we are allowed to withdraw funds from those trusts 
if those laws or the interpretations of those laws change or if new laws are enacted  we may be required to deposit more of the sales proceeds we receive from our sales into the trusts or to defer withdrawals from the trusts  thereby decreasing our cash flow until we are permitted to withdraw the deposited amounts 
this could also reduce our cash available for distribution 
if state laws or their interpretations change  or new laws are enacted relating to the ownership of cemeteries and funeral homes  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
some states  such as new jersey  require cemeteries to be organized in the nonprofit form but permit those nonprofit entities to contract with for profit companies for management services 
the new jersey cemetery act was recently recodified to reflect certain technical amendments that may be interpreted to prohibit for profit entities like us from managing cemeteries located in new jersey 
we manage five cemeteries in new jersey that accounted for approximately of our revenues in the fiscal year ended december  because the regulations implementing the amendments have not yet been adopted  the impact of these amendments is unknown 
if the implementing regulations prohibit us from managing cemeteries in new jersey  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are subject to legal restrictions on our marketing practices that could reduce the volume of our sales which could have an adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 
the enactment or amendment of legislation or regulations relating to marketing activities may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
for example  the recently enacted federal do not call legislation has adversely affected our ability to market our products and services using telephone solicitation by limiting who we may call and increasing our costs of compliance 
as we result  we have increased our reliance on direct mail marketing and telephone follow up with existing contacts 
additional laws or regulations limiting our ability to market through direct mail  over the telephone  through internet and e mail advertising or door to door may make it difficult to identify potential customers  which could increase our costs of marketing 
both increases in marketing costs and restrictions on our ability to market effectively could reduce our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition  as well as our ability to make cash distributions to you 

table of contents we are subject to environmental and health and safety regulations that may adversely affect our operating results 
our cemetery and funeral home operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental and health and safety regulations 
we may become subject to liability for the removal of hazardous substances and solid waste under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and similar state laws 
under cercla and similar state laws  joint and several liability may be imposed on various parties  regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity 
our funeral home  cemetery and crematory operations include the use of some materials that may meet the definition of hazardous substances under cercla and thus may give rise to liability if released to the environment through a spill or discharge 
we cannot assure you that we will not face liability under cercla for any conditions at our properties  and we cannot assure you that these liabilities will not be material 
our cemetery and funeral home operations are subject to regulation of underground and above ground storage tanks and laws managing the disposal of solid waste 
if new requirements under local  state or federal laws were to be adopted  and are more stringent than existing requirements  new permits or capital expenditures may be required 
our funeral home operations are generally subject to federal and state regulations regarding the disposal of medical waste  and are also subject to regulation by federal  state or local authorities under the emergency planning and community right to know act epcra 
we are required to maintain  and may be required to submit to state and local authorities  a list of any hazardous materials we use under epcra tier one and tier two reporting requirements 
our crematory operations are subject to regulation under the federal clean air act and any analogous state laws 
if new regulations applicable to our crematory operations were to be adopted  they could require permits or capital expenditures that would increase our costs of operation and compliance 
risks inherent in an investment in us our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties  which may permit them to favor their own interests to your detriment 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  cfsi llc owned an aggregate limited partner interest in us and owned all of the class a units of our general partner 
conflicts of interest may arise between cfsi llc and its affiliates  including our general partner  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of the unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations the board of directors of our general partner is elected by the owners of our general partner 
although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in good faith  the directors of our general partner also have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to the owners of our general partner 
our partnership agreement limits the liability of our general partner  reduces its fiduciary duties and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions that might  without the limitations  constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  capital expenditures  borrowings  issuances of additional limited partner interests and reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to unitholders 
our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf 
our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates 

table of contents in some instances  our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of distributions  even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units  to make incentive distributions or to hasten the expiration of the subordination period 
affiliates of our general partner own sufficient common and subordinated units to block any attempt to remove our general partner 
our general partner generally may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding units voting together as a single class 
because affiliates of our general partner owned approximately of all the units as of the date of this prospectus  our general partner currently cannot be removed without the consent of its affiliates 
also  if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by the general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal  all remaining subordinated units will automatically be converted into common units and any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished 
this would adversely affect the common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation preference over the subordinated units  which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests 
unitholders have limited voting rights 
unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and  therefore  limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders did not select our general partner or elect the board of directors of our general partner and will have no right to select our general partner or elect its board of directors in the future 
we are not required to have a majority of independent directors on our board  but we are required to establish and maintain an audit committee  which must be made up of at least three independent directors 
we cannot assure you that the persons who control our general partner will elect more independent directors than are necessary to satisfy our audit committee composition requirements  even though most listed corporations are required to have a majority of independent directors on their boards 
unitholders voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than the general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner  cannot be voted on any matter 
in addition  the partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
our general partner can transfer its ownership interest in us without unitholder consent under certain circumstances  and the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the owners of our general partner to transfer their ownership interest in the general partner to a third party 
the new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of the general partner with its own choices and thereby influence the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers 
we may issue additional common units without your approval  which would dilute your existing ownership interests 
during the subordination period  our general partner may cause us to issue up to  additional common units without your approval 
our general partner may also cause us to issue an unlimited number of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank with the common units  without your approval  in numerous circumstances during the subordination period  including  but not limited to  in connection with an 
table of contents acquisition or an expansion capital improvement that increases cash flow from operations per unit on an estimated pro forma basis  if the proceeds of the issuance are used to repay indebtedness  the cost of which to service is greater than the distribution obligations associated with the units issued in connection with its retirement  or the redemption of common units or other equity interests of equal rank with the common units from the net proceeds of an issuance of common units or parity units  but only if the redemption price equals the net proceeds per unit  before expenses  to us 
after the end of the subordination period  we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of the unitholders 
you will not have the right to approve our issuance at any time of equity securities ranking junior to the common units 
the issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects your proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease  because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units  the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by the common unitholders will increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of the common units may decline 
cost reimbursements due our general partner may be substantial and will reduce the cash available for distribution to you 
prior to making any distribution on the common units  we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates  including cfsi llc and the officers and directors of our general partner  for all expenses they incur on our behalf 
the reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to you 
our general partner determines the amount of these expenses 
in addition  our general partner and its affiliates may provide us with other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner 
in establishing cash reserves  our general partner may reduce the amount of available cash for distribution to you 
the partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that it establishes to fund our future operating expenditures 
the partnership agreement also permits the general partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business  to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to you 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price 
if  at any time  our general partner and its affiliates own more than of the common units  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment 
you may also incur a tax liability upon the sale of your common units 

table of contents you may be required to repay distributions that you have received from us 
under certain circumstances  unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act  we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution  limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
assignees who become substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership 
however  assignees are not liable for obligations unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a limited partner if the liabilities could not be determined from the partnership agreement 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
tax risks to common unitholders we may have tax liabilities related to periods before our initial public offering and less net operating losses available to reduce taxable income and therefore tax liabilities for future taxable periods 
because our business was conducted by an affiliated group of corporations during periods prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we may have federal and state income tax liabilities that relate to our prior operations and to transactions related to our formation 
in addition  the amount of cash distributions we receive from our corporate subsidiaries over the next several years will depend in part upon the amount of net operating losses available to those subsidiaries to reduce the amount of income subject to federal income tax they would otherwise pay 
these net operating losses will begin to expire in and are available to reduce future taxable income that would otherwise be subject to federal income taxes 
the amount of net operating losses available to reduce the income tax liability of our corporate subsidiaries in future taxable years could be reduced as a result of the prior operations and the transactions that occurred immediately before our initial public offering 
cfsi llc has agreed to indemnify us against additional income tax liabilities  if any  that arise from our operations prior to our initial public offering  and income tax liabilities  if any  that arise from the consummation of the transactions related to our formation in excess of  if those liabilities are asserted by the irs or any state taxing authority prior to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations for income taxes of cornerstone family services  inc cornerstone for its taxable period ending with the conversion of cornerstone into cfsi llc generally  three years from the filing of the tax return for such period 
also  cfsi llc has agreed to indemnify us against any liabilities we may be subject to in the future resulting from a reduction in our net operating losses as a result of such prior operations or as a result of such formation transactions in excess of that which is believed to result from them at the time of our initial public offering 
we cannot assure you that we will not ultimately be responsible for any or all of these liabilities  if they occur 
any increase in the tax liabilities of our corporate subsidiaries because of a reduction in net operating losses not recouped under the indemnity will reduce our cash available for distribution 
changes in the ownership of our units  including the changes occurring as a result of our initial public offering or the subsequent offering  may result in annual limitations on our use of net operating losses available to reduce taxable income  which could increase our tax liabilities and decrease cash available for distribution in future taxable periods 
the use of the net operating losses by our corporate subsidiaries may be limited if the ownership of our units changes such that our corporate subsidiaries are deemed to have an ownership change under applicable provisions of the internal revenue code 
in general  an ownership change will occur if the percentage of our 
table of contents units  based on the value of the units  owned by certain unitholders or groups of unitholders increases by more than fifty percentage points during a three year period 
for this purpose  the unitholders who acquired interests in us pursuant to our initial public offering will be treated as a single group  as will those persons who acquire units in this or any subsequent offering we may make 
the public group that acquired units in our initial public offering acquired approximately of the total partnership interests that were outstanding immediately after completion of the initial public offering 
those units likely constituted more than of the value of all ownership interests in us 
however  applicable treasury regulations provide generally that if in a public offering units are issued solely for cash  for purposes of calculating the percentage of ownership change resulting from the transaction  the acquiring unitholders will be deemed to acquire only of the number of units they actually acquire 
at the time of our initial public offering  vinson elkins llp opined that the initial public offering should not result in an ownership change 
no ruling has been or will be requested from the irs regarding this issue  and an opinion of counsel represents only the counsel s legal judgment and does not bind the irs or the courts 
thus there remains some risk that our initial public offering resulted in an ownership change 
if an ownership change did occur  each of our corporate subsidiaries would be restricted annually in its ability to use its net operating losses to reduce its federal taxable income to an amount equal to the value of the corporation on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the applicable federal long term tax exempt rate in effect at such time 
any such restriction would have a material adverse impact on our ability to make the full minimum quarterly distribution on our common and subordinated units 
if our initial public offering did not result in an ownership change  we will be limited in the additional units we can issue in the three years following our initial public offering without triggering an ownership change 
while we do not anticipate that an ownership change will occur prior to december   the date by which we expect the majority of our subsidiaries net operating losses to be completely utilized  we cannot assure you that such ownership change will not occur 
if an ownership change should occur during this period  an increase in tax liabilities of our corporate subsidiaries could result  which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to you 
furthermore  in order to avoid the consequences of an ownership change  we may refrain from making some acquisitions that we otherwise would finance at least in part with additional units or the proceeds of an offering of common units 
as a result  we may be less able to implement our acquisition growth strategy during the next three years 
on november   sci funeral services  inc  a subsidiary of service corporation international  acquired approximately of the total partnership interests outstanding immediately after such acquisition and after our issuance of additional general partner interests to our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
management concluded that this acquisition did not result in an ownership change 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by individual states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to you 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter affecting us 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates 
distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to you 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
therefore  our treatment as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several 
table of contents states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise and other forms of taxation 
if any of these states were to impose a tax on us  the cash available for distribution to you would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
we have subsidiaries that will be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and subject to corporate level income taxes 
some of our operations are conducted through subsidiaries that are organized as c corporations 
accordingly  these corporate subsidiaries are subject to corporate level tax  which reduces the cash available for distribution to our partnership and  in turn  to you 
if the irs were to successfully assert that these corporations have more tax liability than we anticipate or legislation was enacted that increased the corporate tax rate  the cash available for distribution could be reduced more than we anticipate 
a successful irs contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely affect the market for our common units  and the cost of any irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the conclusions of our counsel expressed in this prospectus or from positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our counsel s conclusions or the positions we take 
a court may not agree with all of our counsel s conclusions or positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution 
you may be required to pay taxes on income from us even if you do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because our unitholders will be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  you will be required to pay any federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on your share of our taxable income even if you receive no cash distributions from us 
you may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the tax liability that results from that income 
tax gain or loss on disposition of common units could be more or less than expected 
if you sell your common units  you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units 
prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income you were allocated for a common unit  which decreased your tax basis in that common unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to you if the common unit is sold at a price greater than your tax basis in that common unit  even if the price is less than your original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income 
in addition  if you sell your units  you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale 
tax exempt entities and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as individual retirement accounts known as iras and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non us 
table of contents persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file united states federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
if you are a tax exempt entity or a foreign person  you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units 
we will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons  we will take depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of the existing treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns 
you will likely be subject to state and local taxes in states where you do not live as a result of an investment in units 
in addition to federal income taxes  you will likely be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property  even if you do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
you will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions 
further  you may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we currently own assets and do business in alabama  connecticut  delaware  georgia  maryland  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  rhode island  tennessee  virginia and west virginia 
each of these states currently imposes a personal income tax 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may own assets or do business in additional states that impose a personal income tax 
it is your responsibility to file all united states federal  state and local tax returns 
our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state or local tax consequences of an investment in the common units

table of contents item properties cemeteries and funeral homes 
the following table summarizes the distribution of our cemetery and funeral home properties by state as of december  and their weighted average estimated remaining sales life based on number of interment spaces sold during cemeteries funeral homes total net acres weighted average estimated remaining sales life number of interment spaces sold in pennsylvania west virginia virginia maryland north carolina new jersey georgia tennessee ohio rhode island alabama connecticut delaware total includes five cemeteries in new jersey  one cemetery in connecticut and one cemetery in ohio that we operated under long term management agreements 
we calculated estimated remaining sales life for each of our cemeteries by dividing the number of unsold interment spaces by the number of interment spaces sold at that cemetery in the most recent year 
for purposes of estimating remaining sales life  we defined unsold interment spaces as unsold burial lots and unsold spaces in existing mausoleum crypts as of december  we defined interment spaces sold in as the number of burial lots sold  net of cancellations  the number of spaces sold in existing mausoleum crypts  net of cancellations  and the number of spaces sold in mausoleum crypts that we have not yet built  net of cancellations 
we count the sale of a double depth burial lot as the sale of one interment space even though a double depth burial lot includes two interment rights 
we count an unsold double depth burial lot as one unsold interment space 
because our sales of cremation niches were immaterial  we did not include cremation niches in the calculation of estimated remaining sales life 
when calculating estimated remaining sales life  we did not take into account any future cemetery expansion 
in addition  sales of an unusually high or low number of interment spaces in a particular year affect our calculation of estimated remaining sales life 
future sales may differ from previous years sales  and actual remaining sales life may differ from our estimates 
we calculated weighted average remaining sales life by aggregating unsold interment spaces and interment spaces sold on a state by state or company wide basis 
based on the number of interment spaces sold in  we estimate that our cemeteries have an aggregate weighted average remaining sales life of years 

table of contents the following table shows the cemetery properties that we owned or operated as of december   grouped by estimated remaining sales life years years years years years over years pennsylvania west virginia virginia maryland north carolina new jersey georgia tennessee ohio rhode island alabama connecticut delaware total we believe that we have either satisfactory title to or valid rights to use all of our cemetery properties 
the seven cemetery properties that we operate under long term management agreements are held by cemetery associations that are owned by the cemetery lot holders or have no legal owners 
we believe that the cemetery associations have either satisfactory title to or valid rights to use these seven cemetery properties and that we have valid rights to use these properties under the management agreements 
although title to the cemetery properties is subject to encumbrances such as liens for taxes  encumbrances securing payment obligations  easements  restrictions and immaterial encumbrances  we do not believe that any of these burdens should materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties  nor should these burdens materially interfere with the use of our cemetery properties in the operation of our business as described in this document 
many of our cemetery properties are located in zoned regions  and we believe that cemetery use is permitted for those cemeteries either as expressly permitted under applicable zoning ordinances  through a special exception to applicable zoning designations  or as an existing non conforming use 
other 
our corporate headquarters occupy approximately  square feet of leased office space in bristol  pennsylvania  a suburb of philadelphia 
the lease has a term expiring in  and we consider the space to be adequate for our present and anticipated future requirements 
we are also tenants under various leases covering office spaces other than our corporate headquarters 
in addition  we own a  square foot plant in butler county  pennsylvania  where we manufacture burial vaults used in our cemetery operations  and we own a  square foot building in marion  virginia  which is no longer being used in our business 
item legal proceedings we  and certain of our subsidiaries  are parties to legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and adequate financial condition or cash flows 
we carry insurance with coverage and coverage limits that we believe to be customary in the funeral home and cemetery industries 
although there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  we believe that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations

table of contents part ii item market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities market information our common units are listed on the nasdaq national market nasdaq under the symbol ston 
prior to september   our equity securities were not publicly traded 
as of march   there were  common units outstanding  representing a limited partner interest in us 
as of that date  there were  subordinated units outstanding  representing a limited partner interest in us 
as of february   there were unitholders of record  representing approximately  beneficial holders 
there is no established public trading market for our subordinated units 
the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of our common units for the periods indicated  based on the daily composite listing of common unit transactions for the nasdaq 
price range declared distributions quarter ended high low september  december  march  june  september  december  our units began trading on nasdaq on september  distributions were declared and paid within days following the close of each quarter on february   may   november  and february   respectively 
cash distribution policy quarterly distributions of available cash general 
within approximately days after the end of each quarter  we will distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date 
available cash for any quarter consists of cash on hand at the end of that quarter  plus cash on hand from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter but before the date of determination of available cash for the quarter  less cash reserves 
cash and other investments held in merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts are not treated as available cash until they are distributed to us 
minimum quarterly distribution 
common units are entitled to receive distributions from operating surplus of per unit per quarter  or per unit per year  before any such distributions are paid on our subordinated units 
we cannot guarantee you that we will be able to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units in any quarter 
we are prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if the distributions would cause an event of default  or if an event of default is existing  under our debt agreements 
general partner interest and incentive distribution rights 
our general partner is entitled to of all distributions that we make prior to our liquidation 
our general partner has the right  but not the obligation  to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its general partner interest 
the general partner s interest in these distributions may be reduced if we issue additional units in the future and our general partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its general partner interest 

table of contents our general partner also currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive increasing percentages  up to a maximum of  of the cash we distribute from operating surplus in excess of per unit 
the maximum distribution of includes distributions paid to the general partner on its general partner interest but does not include any distributions that the general partner may receive on units that it owns 
operating surplus and capital surplus general 
all cash distributed to unitholders is characterized as either operating surplus or capital surplus 
we distribute available cash from operating surplus differently than available cash from capital surplus 
we treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating surplus until the sum of all available cash distributed since we began operations equals the operating surplus as of the most recent date of determination of available cash 
we will treat any amount distributed in excess of operating surplus  regardless of its source  as capital surplus 
operating surplus 
operating surplus consists of our cash balance on september   plus million as described below  plus cash receipts from our operations  including cash withdrawn from merchandise and perpetual care trusts  plus working capital borrowings made after the end of a quarter but before the date of determination of operating surplus for that quarter  less operating expenditures  including cash deposited in merchandise and perpetual care trusts  maintenance capital expenditures and the repayment of working capital borrowings  less the amount of cash reserves for future operating expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures 
as reflected above  operating surplus includes million in addition to our cash balance on september   cash receipts from our operations and cash from working capital borrowings 
this amount does not reflect actual cash on hand at closing that is available for distribution to our unitholders 
rather  it is a provision that will enable us  if we choose  to distribute as operating surplus up to million of cash we receive in the future from non operating sources  such as asset sales outside the ordinary course of business  sales of our equity and debt securities  and long term borrowings  that would otherwise be distributed as capital surplus 
as described above  operating surplus is reduced by the amount of our maintenance capital expenditures but not our expansion capital expenditures 
for our purposes  maintenance capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain  over the long term  the operating capacity of our capital assets  and expansion capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that increase  over the long term  the operating capacity of our capital assets 
examples of maintenance capital expenditures include costs to build roads and install sprinkler systems on our cemetery properties and purchases of equipment for those purposes and  in most instances  costs to develop new areas of our cemeteries 
examples of expansion capital expenditures include costs to identify and complete acquisitions of new cemeteries and funeral homes and to construct new funeral homes 
costs to construct mausoleum crypts and lawn crypts may be considered to be a combination of maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures 
our general partner  with the concurrence of its conflicts committee  may allocate capital expenditures between maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures and may determine the period over which maintenance capital expenditures will be subtracted from operating surplus 
capital surplus 
capital surplus consists of borrowings other than working capital borrowings  
table of contents sales of our equity and debt securities  and sales or other dispositions of assets for cash other than sales or other dispositions of excess cemetery property in an aggregate amount not to exceed million in any four quarter period  sales or other dispositions of inventory  accounts receivable and other current assets in the ordinary course of business  and sales or other dispositions of assets as a part of normal retirements or replacements 
the million exception for sales of excess cemetery property may be increased by our general partner  with the concurrence of its conflicts committee  if the size of our operations increases as a result of acquisitions or other expansions 
distributions of available cash from operating surplus the following table illustrates the priority of distributions of available cash from operating surplus between the unitholders and our general partner during the subordination period 
during the subordination period the common units will have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit  plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units 
the amounts set forth in the table in the column titled marginal percentage interest in distributions are the percentage interests of our general partner and the unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column titled total quarterly distribution target amount  until the available cash from operating surplus that we distribute reaches the next target distribution level  if any 
the percentage interests shown for our general partner include its general partner interest and assume the general partner has contributed any additional capital required to maintain its general partner interest and has not transferred the incentive distribution rights 
marginal percentage interest in distributions total quarterly distribution target amount common unitholders subordinated unitholders common and subordinated unitholders general partner minimum quarterly distribution up to arrearages on minimum quarterly distribution up to minimum quarterly distribution up to first target distribution above up to second target distribution above up to third target distribution above up to thereafter above when the subordination period ends  all remaining subordinated units will convert into common units on a one for one basis and will then participate  pro rata  with the other common units in distributions of available cash 
distributions of available cash from capital surplus we do not currently expect to make any distributions of available cash from capital surplus 
however  to the extent that we make any distributions of available cash from capital surplus  they will be made in the following manner first  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until we have distributed for each common unit an amount of available cash from capital surplus equal to the initial public offering price  
table of contents second  to the common unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until we have distributed for each common unit an amount of available cash from capital surplus equal to any unpaid arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units  and thereafter  we will make all distributions of available cash from capital surplus as if they were from operating surplus the partnership agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the initial unit price from the initial public offering  which is a return of capital 
the initial public offering price less any distributions of capital surplus per unit is referred to as the unrecovered initial unit price 
each time a distribution of capital surplus is made  the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced in the same proportion as the corresponding reduction in the unrecovered initial unit price 
because distributions of capital surplus will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution  after any of these distributions are made  it may be easier for the general partner to receive incentive distributions and for the subordinated units to convert into common units 
any distribution of capital surplus before the unrecovered initial unit price is reduced to zero cannot be applied  however  to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution or any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters 
if we distribute capital surplus on a unit in an amount equal to the initial unit price and have paid all arrearages on the common units  the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced to zero 
once the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels are reduced to zero  all subsequent distributions will be from operating surplus  with being paid to the holders of units and to our general partner 
subordination period general 
during the subordination period the common units will have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit  plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units 
upon expiration of the subordination period  all subordinated units will convert into common units on a one for one basis and will then participate  pro rata  with the other common units in distributions of available cash  and the common units will no longer be entitled to arrearages 
expiration of subordination period 
the subordination period will extend until the first day of any quarter beginning after september  that each of the following tests are met distributions of available cash from operating surplus on each of the outstanding common units and subordinated units for the three consecutive four quarter periods immediately preceding that date equaled or exceeded the minimum quarterly distribution  the adjusted operating surplus as defined below generated during the three consecutive four quarter periods immediately preceding that date equaled or exceeded the sum of the minimum quarterly distributions on all of the outstanding common units and subordinated units and the related distribution on the general partner interest  and there are no arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units 
in addition  if the unitholders remove our general partner other than for cause and units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal the subordination period will end and each subordinated unit will immediately convert into one common unit  
table of contents any existing arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units will be extinguished  and our general partner will have the right to convert its general partner interest and its incentive distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests 
early conversion of subordinated units 
if the tests for ending the subordination period are satisfied for any three consecutive four quarter periods ending on or after september   of the subordinated units will convert into an equal number of common units 
similarly  if those tests are also satisfied for any three consecutive four quarter periods ending on or after september   an additional of the subordinated units will convert into an equal number of common units 
the second early conversion of subordinated units may not occur  however  until at least one year following the end of the period for the first early conversion of subordinated units 
adjusted operating surplus 
adjusted operating surplus is a measure that we use to determine the operating surplus that is actually earned in a test period by excluding items from prior periods that affect operating surplus in the test period 
adjusted operating surplus consists of operating surplus generated with respect to that period  less any net increase in working capital borrowings with respect to that period but only to the extent that outstanding working capital borrowings exceed million as a result of such increase  less any net decrease in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period not relating to an operating expenditure made with respect to that period  less the amount  if any  by which the aggregate principal amount withdrawn from merchandise trusts with respect to that period exceeds the aggregate amount deposited into merchandise trusts with respect to that period  plus any net decrease in working capital borrowings with respect to that period but only to the extent that such decrease would reduce outstanding working capital borrowings to an amount not less than million  plus any net increase in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period required by any debt instrument for the repayment of principal  interest or premium  plus the amount  if any  by which the aggregate amount deposited into merchandise trusts with respect to that period exceeds the aggregate principal amount withdrawn from merchandise trusts with respect to that period 
the limitations on the effect of net increases and net decreases in working capital borrowings set forth in the second and fifth bullet points above will become inoperative and have no further effect with respect to any period ending after september  adjustment of minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels in addition to adjusting the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels to reflect a distribution of capital surplus  if we combine our units into fewer units or subdivide our units into a greater number of units  we will proportionately adjust the minimum quarterly distribution  the target distribution levels  the unrecovered initial unit price  the number of common units issuable during the subordination period without a unitholder vote  and the number of common units into which a subordinated unit is convertible 

table of contents for example  if a two for one split of the common units should occur  the minimum quarterly distribution  the target distribution levels and the unrecovered initial unit price would each be reduced to of its initial level  the number of common units issuable during the subordination period without a unitholder vote would double and each subordinated unit would be convertible into two common units 
we will not make any adjustment by reason of the issuance of additional units for cash or property 
in addition  if legislation is enacted or if existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that causes us to become taxable as a corporation or otherwise subject to taxation as an entity for federal  state or local income tax purposes  we will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels for each quarter by multiplying each distribution level by a fraction  the numerator of which is available cash for that quarter and the denominator of which is the sum of available cash for that quarter plus our general partner s estimate of our aggregate liability for the income taxes payable by reason of that legislation or interpretation 
to the extent that the actual tax liability differs from the estimated tax liability for any quarter  the difference will be accounted for in subsequent quarters 
distributions of cash upon liquidation if we dissolve in accordance with the partnership agreement  we will sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process called liquidation 
we will first apply the proceeds of liquidation to the payment of our creditors 
we will distribute any remaining proceeds to the unitholders and our general partner  in accordance with their respective capital account balances  as adjusted to reflect any taxable gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of our assets in liquidation 
the allocations of taxable gain upon liquidation are intended  to the extent possible  to allow the holders of common units to receive proceeds equal to their unrecovered initial unit price plus the minimum quarterly distribution for the quarter during which liquidation occurs plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters prior to any allocation of gain to the common units 
there may not be sufficient taxable gain upon our liquidation to enable the holders of common units to fully recover all of these amounts  even though there may be cash available for distribution to the holders of subordinated units 
any additional taxable gain will be allocated in a manner intended to allow our general partner to receive proceeds in respect of its incentive distribution rights 
if there are losses upon liquidation  they will first be allocated to the subordinated units and the general partner interest until the capital accounts of the subordinated units have been reduced to zero and then to the common units and the general partner interest until the capital accounts of the common units have been reduced to zero 
any remaining loss will be allocated to the general partner interest

the net proceeds to the partnership  after deducting underwriting discounts but before paying offering costs  from these sales of common units was million 

as described in the partnership agreement  during the subordination period the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distributions until the common units have received their minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages from prior quarters 
the subordination period will end once the partnership meets certain financial tests described in the partnership agreement  but it generally cannot end before september  when the subordination period ends  all subordinated units will convert into common units on a one for one basis  and the common units will no longer be entitled to arrearages

table of contents cemetery operations sources of revenues 
our results of operations are determined primarily by the volume of sales of products and services and the timing of product delivery and performance of services 
we derive our revenues primarily from at need sales of cemetery interment rights  merchandise and services  which we recognize as revenues at the time of sale  pre need sales of cemetery interment rights  which we generally recognize as revenues when we have collected of the sales price from the customer  pre need sales of cemetery merchandise  which we recognize as revenues when we satisfy the criteria specified below for delivery of the merchandise to the customer  pre need sales of cemetery services  other than perpetual care services  which we recognize as revenues when we perform the services for the customer  accumulated merchandise trust earnings related to the delivery of pre need cemetery merchandise and the performance of pre need cemetery services  which we recognize as revenues when we deliver the merchandise or perform the services  income from perpetual care trusts  which we recognize as revenues as the income is earned in the trust  and other items  such as interest income on pre need installment contracts and sales of land 
revenues from pre need sales of cemetery merchandise and the related accumulated merchandise trust earnings are deferred until the merchandise is delivered to the customer  which generally means that the merchandise is complete and ready for installation or  in the case of merchandise other than burial vaults  storage on third party premises  the merchandise is either installed or stored at an off site location  at no additional cost to us  and specifically identified with a particular customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
we generally satisfy these delivery criteria by purchasing the merchandise and either installing it on our cemetery property or storing it  at the customer s request  in third party or vendor warehouses  at no additional cost to us  until the time of need 
with respect to burial vaults  we install the vaults rather than storing them to satisfy the delivery criteria 
when merchandise is stored for a customer  we may issue a certificate of ownership to the customer to evidence the transfer to the customer of the risks and rewards of ownership 
deferred cemetery revenues  net and deferred selling and obtaining costs 
deferred revenues from pre need sales and related merchandise trust earnings are reflected on our balance sheet in deferred cemetery revenues  net  until we recognize the amounts as revenues 
deferred cemetery revenues  net  also includes deferred revenues from pre need sales that were entered into by entities we acquired prior to the time we acquired them 
these entities include those that we acquired at the time of the formation of cornerstone and other entities we subsequently acquired 
we recognize revenues from these acquired pre need sales in the manner described above that is  when we deliver the merchandise to  or perform the services for  the customer 
our profit margin on these pre need sales is generally less than our profit margin on other pre need sales because  in accordance with industry practice at the time these acquired pre need sales were made  none of the selling expenses were recognized at the time of sale 
as a result  we are required to recognize all of the expenses including deferred selling expenses associated with these acquired pre need sales when we recognize the revenues from those sales 
under current industry practice  we recognize certain expenses  such as indirect selling costs  maintenance costs and general and administrative costs  at the time the pre need sale is made and defer other expenses  such as direct selling costs and costs of goods sold  until we recognize revenues on the sale 
as a result  our profit margin on current pre need sales is generally higher than on the pre need sales we acquired

pre need sales 
pre need products and services are typically sold on an installment basis with terms ranging from months to months  with an average of months 
our pre need contracts are subject to cooling off periods  generally between three and thirty days  required by state law during which the customer may elect to cancel the contract and receive a full refund of amounts paid 
subject to applicable state law  if customers cancel after the cooling off period  we are generally permitted to retain the amounts already paid on contracts  including any amounts that were required to be deposited into trust 
historically  our customers have cancelled contracts representing approximately of our pre need sales based on contract dollar amounts after the cooling off period 
if the products and services purchased under a pre need contract are needed for interment before payment has been made in full  the balance due becomes immediately due and must be paid in cash 
approximately of our pre need sales contracts do not bear interest 
historically  we did not charge interest on pre need sales contracts having a term of months or less  and during  we did not charge interest on contracts with a term of months or less 
in those cases  interest is imputed at varying market rates  currently 
the interest rates on our interest bearing pre need contracts range from to  with a weighted average interest rate of 
we offer prepayment incentives to customers whose pre need contracts are longer than months and bear interest 
if those customers pay their contracts in full in less than months  we rebate the interest that we collected from them 
even though this rebate policy reduces the amount of interest income we receive on our accounts receivable  the net effect is an increase in our immediate cash flow 
interest income from pre need sales  including imputed interest  accounted for of our revenues 
trusting 
we are generally required by state law to place a portion of the sales price of cemetery interment rights  whether at need or pre need  into a perpetual care trust to maintain the cemetery property in perpetuity 
the amount that we are required to deposit into a perpetual care trust varies from state to state but is generally to of the sales price of the interment right 
as payments are received from the customer  we deposit a pro rata amount of the payment into a perpetual care trust 
for example  if we receive a payment of of the sales price from the customer  we would deposit into the perpetual care trust of the total amount required to be placed into trust for that sale 
under the state laws that require the creation of the perpetual care trusts  we are not permitted to withdraw the trust principal  and our creditors and customers have no right to make claim to the funds deposited into these trusts 
amounts held in these perpetual care trusts are invested by third party investment managers as discussed in more detail below 
as a result  we do not possess legal title to the trust principal in these perpetual care trusts  however  in accordance with current industry practice  amounts deposited into perpetual care trusts are reflected at fair market value on the asset portion of our balance sheet as of december  as an asset entitled perpetual care trusts  restricted  at fair value  and an equal amount is reflected on the liabilities  preferred stock and common stockholders equity portion of our balance sheet as an item entitled non controlling interest in perpetual care trusts 
for periods ending before march   we did not include perpetual care trust 
table of contents principal on our balance sheet in accordance with prior industry practice 
we recognize income from perpetual care trusts in our revenues as it is earned in the trust  regardless of when we withdraw it 
we are permitted under state law to withdraw the investment income  such as interest and dividends  but not the capital gains  from perpetual care trusts  generally on a monthly basis 
to maximize the income generated by perpetual care trusts  we have established investment guidelines for the third party investment managers so that substantially all of the funds held in perpetual care trusts are invested in intermediate term  investment grade  fixed income securities  high yield fixed income securities and real estate investment trusts 
we are required to use all amounts withdrawn from perpetual care trusts for cemetery maintenance and administration 
we are generally required by state law to deposit a portion of the sales price of pre need cemetery merchandise and services  or the estimated current cost of providing that merchandise and those services  into a merchandise trust to ensure that we will have sufficient funds in the future to purchase the merchandise or perform the services 
the amount we are required to deposit into a merchandise trust varies from state to state but is generally to of the sales price of the merchandise or services 
as payments are received from the customer  we deposit a pro rata amount of the payment into the merchandise trust 
for example  if we receive a payment of of the sales price from the customer  we would deposit into the merchandise trust of the total amount required to be placed into trust for the merchandise and services sold 
under the state laws that require the creation of the merchandise trusts  we are not permitted to withdraw the trust principal  except as described below  and our creditors and customers have no right to make claim to the funds deposited into these trusts 
amounts held in these merchandise trusts are invested by third party investment managers as discussed in more detail below 
as a result  we do not possess legal title to the trust principal in these merchandise trusts  however  in accordance with current industry practice  amounts deposited into merchandise trusts are reflected at fair value on our balance sheet as of december  as an asset called merchandise trusts  restricted  at fair value 
for periods ending prior to march   amounts deposited into merchandise trust were reflected at cost on our balance sheet as an asset called due from merchandise trust  in accordance with prior industry practice 
earnings on funds held in merchandise trusts  including investment income and capital gains  are included separately on our balance sheet in deferred cemetery revenues  net 
these amounts remain on our balance sheet until we recognize them as revenues 
we recognize amounts withdrawn from merchandise trusts  including principal  as revenues when we satisfy the criteria for delivery of the related merchandise discussed above or perform the related services 
we are permitted to withdraw the investment income  such as interest and dividends  as well as capital gains  from merchandise trusts at varying times depending on the applicable state law 
in most states  we are permitted to make monthly withdrawals of investment income  but in other states we are permitted to withdraw income less frequently or only upon death 
in all states  however  we are permitted to withdraw trust principal and earnings to purchase the merchandise or perform the services or  generally  when the customer cancels the contract 
we invest the amounts deposited into merchandise trusts  within specified investment guidelines  primarily in intermediate term  investment grade fixed income securities  high yield fixed income securities  real estate investment trusts and  to a lesser extent  equity securities and cash 
the income earned on funds held in perpetual care trusts and merchandise trusts can be materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and  in the case of merchandise trusts  by the performance of the stock market to the extent that the funds held in merchandise trusts are invested in equity securities 
earnings on merchandise and perpetual care trusts that we recognized as revenues accounted for of our revenue 
during  and our average annual rates of return from realized earnings on funds held in merchandise trusts were  and  respectively  and our average annual rates of return from realized earnings on funds held in perpetual care trusts were  and  respectively 
we cannot assure you  however  that that we will continue to be successful in achieving any particular return in the future 
amounts held in trusts are invested by third party investment managers who are selected by the trust and compliance committee of our board of directors 
these investment managers are required to invest our trust funds in accordance with applicable state law and internal investment guidelines adopted by our trust and 
table of contents compliance committee 
our investment managers are monitored by third party investment advisors selected by our trust and compliance committee who advise the committee on the determination of asset allocations  evaluate the investment managers and provide detailed monthly reports on the performance of each merchandise and perpetual care trust 
unrealized gains and losses in merchandise trusts have no immediate impact on our revenues  earnings or cash flow unless the fair market value of the funds declines below the estimated costs to deliver the related products and services  in which case we would be required to record a current charge to earnings equal to the difference between the fair market value of the funds and the estimated costs 
over time  gains and losses realized in merchandise trusts are allocated to the underlying pre need contracts and affect the amount of trust earnings to be recognized as revenues when we deliver the related products or perform the related services 
as of december   the aggregate fair market value of funds held in merchandise trusts exceeded our costs to purchase the related products and perform the related services by million 
at the time we enter into a pre need contract  we determine both the amount required to be deposited into a merchandise trust and our cost to purchase the related products and perform the related services 
we determine the amount required to be deposited into a merchandise trust based on applicable state law 
we determine our cost to purchase a product using the actual current cost of the product as indicated on the price list from the manufacturer at the time we enter into the pre need contract 
we determine our cost to perform a service based on the current cost of the labor necessary to perform the service at the time we enter into the pre need contract 
our cost to purchase certain products  such as grave markers  grave marker bases and caskets  is generally fixed through under supply agreements with the manufacturers of those products 
we are able to control the cost of the vaults we are required to purchase by manufacturing most of those vaults 
we are also able to control the cost to perform services  such as openings and closings  by purchasing the necessary equipment and substantially using our employees to perform these services for us 
our cost to purchase any product or to perform any service is generally less than of the retail price of such product or service 
the retail price is the price at which we sell the product or service to our customers 
because each state in which we operate requires us to deposit into a merchandise trust an amount equal to at least of the retail price and usually a greater percentage of the related products and services  our cost to purchase these products and perform those services is generally less than the amount required to be deposited in trust 
as of december   approximately of the fair market value of the amounts held in merchandise trusts was invested in fixed income securities to ensure that the market value of those funds will be sufficient to cover our cost to purchase the related products and perform the related services at the time of purchase and performance 
some states impose additional restrictions on our ability to withdraw merchandise trust earnings if those trusts have realized losses 
for example  if a pennsylvania merchandise trust realizes a loss  the trust is required to recover the amount of the realized loss  either by earning income or generating capital gains  before we are allowed to withdraw earnings  except to purchase the related products or perform the related services 
other states  such as virginia  permit continued withdrawals of merchandise trust earnings following a realized loss so long as the fair market value of the funds held in trust equals or exceeds the cost of the related products and services 
cash flow 
the impact of pre need sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sales price required to be deposited into trust and the terms of the particular contract  such as the amount of the required down payment  the products purchased and the length of the contract 
customers are required to make a down payment on a pre need contract of at least of the total sales price  with the average down payment equal to of the total sales price 
when we receive a payment from a customer on a pre need contract  we first deposit the requisite portion into trust as required by state law 
then  we pay all or a portion of the commission due to the salesperson responsible for the sale 
we generally pay commissions to our 
table of contents pre need sales personnel based on a percentage  usually to  of the total sales price  but only to the extent that cash is received from the customer 
if the down payment received from the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent installments  but only to the extent of of the cash received from the customer in each installment 
because we are required to deposit a portion of each installment into trust  we are usually required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due to the salesperson 
accordingly  pre need sales are generally cash flow negative initially but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  generally six to seven months after the down payment is made  depending upon the trust requirements  the terms of the particular contract  the sales commission paid and the timing of delivery or performance of the related products and services 
for example  on a pre need contract with a total sales price of  a down payment  a perpetual care and merchandise trusting requirement  a sales commission and a one year term without interest  our short term cash flow would be as follows when we receive the down payment from the customer  we would deposit of the payment  or in trust and pay of the commission due to the salesperson  or  but only to the extent that we received cash from the customer  or our total cash obligations would be even though we only received from the customer 
we would use of our operating cash to pay the sales commission and  at this time  would be cash flow negative on the contract 
in month one  when we receive the first installment from the customer  we would deposit  or  into trust and pay of the balance of the commission due to the sales person  or our total cash obligations would be even though we only received from the customer 
we would use of our operating cash to pay sales commission and would still be cash flow negative on the contract 
in month two  when we receive the next installment from the customer  we would deposit  or  into trust  but we would have no further commission due on the sale 
the remaining received from the customer would go back into our operating cash  and we would break even on the contract on a cash flow basis 
in month three  when we receive the next installment from the customer  we would deposit  or  into trust and the remaining would go back into our operating cash 
in this month  we would become cash flow positive on the contract 
we can enhance our operating cash flow by purchasing and delivering many of our products in advance of the time of customer need and by performing certain services prior to the time of need 
for example  within the allowances of state law  we purchase burial vaults  grave markers and caskets  and perform initial openings and closings to install the burial vault in the ground before the time of need 
when we satisfy the criteria for delivery of pre need products or perform pre need services  we are permitted to withdraw the related principal and any income and capital gains that we have not already withdrawn from the merchandise trust  and we recognize the amounts withdrawn  including amounts previously withdrawn  as revenues 
advance purchasing helps us avoid the negative cash flow impact of depositing significant portions of our sales proceeds in trusts while earning rates on those trusts that are currently less than interest rates we pay on our debt 
to the extent that we can purchase and deliver products and perform services in advance of the time of need  we can accelerate  within the limitations of gaap  the timing of our revenue recognition for these products and services 
as a result  decisions made by our management to purchase and deliver products or perform services in advance  for cash flow or other reasons  affects the timing of revenue recognition from the underlying sales 
in and  the rates of return on funds held in merchandise and perpetual care trusts generally exceeded the interest rates on our outstanding debt 
we focused on increasing our assets by holding the funds deposited in merchandise and perpetual care trusts until the time of need and borrowing under our credit facility any cash needed for our operations 
in  however  market conditions changed  and the interest rates on our outstanding debt generally exceeded our rates of return on funds held in merchandise and perpetual care trusts 
we began to consider alternative methods for increasing our cash flow in response to these declining rates of 
table of contents return 
by  we had adjusted our cash flow management to accelerate the withdrawal of funds from merchandise trusts  within the limitations of applicable state law  and to purchase and deliver pre need products and perform pre need services in advance of the time of need 
we used the amounts withdrawn from merchandise trusts  after deducting our costs to purchase the related products and perform the related services  to service our outstanding debt and operate our business 
the availability of these withdrawn funds for our operations reduced the amount of additional borrowings we otherwise would have been required to make under our credit facility  and we did not incur the interest expense that would have been associated with those borrowings 
we are somewhat limited  however  in our ability to purchase some products in advance of the time of need because of their availability 
given our large volume of pre need sales  it is unlikely that our suppliers could provide  or we could manufacture  all of the products included in our pre need backlog at any given time 
for example  we generally need over  vaults per year to fulfill our pre need contract obligations  of which we manufacture approximately  at our plant 
we must purchase any excess from third party suppliers who must also meet the demands of other cemetery operators 
we currently purchase burial vaults from third party providers to assist us in meeting the demands of our accelerated purchase and delivery program 
we are also limited in our ability to perform certain services in advance of the time of need because of their nature or our resources 
for example  we cannot perform the final opening and closing  which is the placing of the casket into the ground  or inscribe the date of death on the monument or marker until the time of need 
even if we chose to perform all of the services in our pre need backlog that could be performed in advance of need  such as installing all of the burial vaults in our pre need backlog  we would not currently have the labor  equipment or other resources to perform all of those services in a short period of time 
at need sales 
at need sales of products and services are required to be paid for in full with cash at the time of sale 
at that time  we first deposit any amount required to be placed in perpetual care trusts 
then we pay commissions  which are usually equal to of the total sales price  to our sales personnel 
we are not required to deposit any amounts from our at need sales into merchandise trusts 
expenses 
our primary variable operating costs are cost of goods sold and selling expenses 
cost of goods sold reflects the actual cost of purchasing products and performing services and averaged from to of the related sales price for the last three years 
fixed price contracts with our major suppliers allow us to keep the cost of some products constant through selling expense consists of salesperson and sales management payroll costs  including selling commissions  bonuses and employee benefits  and other costs of obtaining product and service sales  such as advertising  marketing  postage and telephone 
selling expense also includes override commissions paid to our cemetery managers based on the volume of sales made for the cemeteries they manage 
override commissions are generally to of gross sales price and are payable weekly 
selling expense has historically averaged between and of product and service sales 
additionally  we self insure medical expenses of our employees up to certain individual and aggregate limits after which our insurer is responsible for additional medical expenses 
our self insurance policy may result in variability in our future operating expenses 
in addition to our variable operating expenses  we incur fixed costs  primarily for cemetery expense  depreciation of property and equipment and general and administrative expense for our cemeteries 
cemetery expense represents the cost to maintain and repair our cemetery properties and consists primarily of labor and equipment  utilities  real estate taxes and other maintenance items 
repairs necessary to maintain our cemeteries are expensed as they are incurred 
other maintenance costs required over the long term to maintain the operating capacity of our cemeteries  such as to build roads and install sprinkler systems  are capitalized 
we depreciate our property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
general and administrative expense  which does not include corporate overhead  includes primarily insurance and other costs necessary to maintain our cemetery offices 

table of contents direct costs associated with pre need sales of cemetery merchandise and services  such as sales commissions and cost of goods sold  are reflected in the balance sheet in deferred selling and obtaining costs and deferred cemetery revenues  net  respectively and are expensed as the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed 
indirect costs  such as marketing and advertising costs  are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
sales of cemetery lots and interment rights  whether at need or pre need  typically generate a higher profit margin than the other products and services we sell 
this is primarily because our cost of goods sold is lower on these sales 
when we purchase cemetery property  we allocate the purchase price to the property based on the number of burial lots 
as we recognize revenues from sales of interment rights or land  we expense the cost of the associated lots as the cost of goods sold 
cost saving initiatives 
our operations are organized geographically in five regions  which allow us to reduce operating and administrative costs by sharing sales and administrative personnel  equipment and other resources 
in we continued several measures initiated in intended to reduce our operating costs 
for example  we continued to negotiate the pricing of some of our contracts with a number of our major vendors and suppliers and provided our operating personnel with purchase credit cards that enable them to process transactions directly into our accounting system  which has reduced our administrative costs 
we also renegotiated the pricing of some of our employee benefit plans 
outlook 
we believe that in order to expand our cemetery operations  we must attract new customers  continue to attract and hire talented sales personnel and management and enhance our current marketing department to generate additional pre need sales 
our principal target market is the to year old category because this age group typically purchases pre need products and services at a higher rate than younger age groups 
this target age group is expected to experience a compounded annual growth rate from to  or approximately three times the annual growth rate for the public overall 
we believe that the aging of the baby boom generation will more than offset the impact of increased life expectancy 
we believe that competition experienced by individual cemetery properties is generally limited to existing cemeteries within the same area 
competition from new entrants is minimized by the significant barriers to establishing a new cemetery in any particular location  including the availability of land  compliance with local regulatory requirements and the significant start up capital costs  such as paving roads and installing sprinkler systems 
heritage and tradition also make it difficult to establish a new cemetery  as existing cemeteries have often served multiple generations of families and have developed strong family loyalty 
the death care industry is facing challenges  however  including an increasing trend toward cremation and difficulty in attracting and retaining high quality sales and management personnel to the industry 
on november   stonemor acquired cemeteries and six funeral homes from service corporation international nyse sci for million 
stonemor paid million in cash and  stonemor limited partner units  representing the additional million 
in addition  stonemor will assume the merchandise and service liabilities associated with certain pre arranged bonded contracts related to the properties 
we intend to continue to expand our operations through accretive acquisitions of high quality cemetery properties 
however  our valuations of potential acquisitions of high quality cemeteries may be below the current sellers expectations  which may make it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions of desired properties on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
furthermore  we are not permitted to make acquisitions for more than million  or any series of acquisitions aggregating more than million in any consecutive month period  without the requisite consent of the lenders under our credit facility 
in addition  we may face competition for future acquisitions because several large death care companies have recently announced their intention to resume some level of acquisition activity 
when we acquire cemeteries that do not have an existing pre need sales program or a significant amount of pre need products and services that have been sold but not yet delivered or 
table of contents performed  the operation of the cemetery and implementation of a pre need sales program after acquisition may require significant amounts of working capital 
this may make it more difficult for us to make accretive acquisitions 
during  we plan to grow our existing base of cemetery revenues by continuing our program to accelerate the purchase and delivery of pre need products and the performance of pre need services and by increasing pre need sales while diligently managing our cash expenses 
we also expect to continue to have greater access to burial vaults and caskets  through contracts negotiated with third party suppliers  which will help us satisfy the requirements of our accelerated purchase and delivery program 
we also intend to take advantage of other opportunities to grow our cemetery operations through acquisitions as described above 
funeral home operations additionally  we derive revenues from the sale of funeral home merchandise  including caskets and related funeral merchandise  and services  including removal and preparation of remains  the use of our facilities for visitation  worship and performance of funeral services and transportation services 
we sell these services and merchandise almost exclusively at the time of need utilizing salaried licensed funeral directors 
in  our funeral home revenues accounted for approximately of our revenues 
more than funerals were performed at our funeral homes in we generally include revenues from pre need casket sales in the results of our cemetery operations 
however  some states require that caskets be sold by funeral homes  and revenues from casket sales in those states are included in our funeral home results 
we do not report the results of our funeral home operations as a separate business segment 
eight of our funeral homes are located on the grounds of cemeteries that we own 
as a result  we are able to combine certain general and administrative expenses that relate to both the cemetery and the funeral home at the same location 
our other funeral home operating expenses consist primarily of compensation to our funeral directors and the cost of caskets 
other corporate overhead 
we incur fixed costs for corporate overhead primarily for centralized functions  such as payroll  accounting  collections and professional fees 
we also incur expenses relating to reporting requirements under us federal securities laws and certain other additional expenses of being a public company 
during  our expenses related to being a public company totaled of which  was related to first year costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of consolidation 
our historical operations are part of a consolidated group for financial reporting purposes that includes the cemeteries we operate under long term management contracts with the cemetery associations that own the cemetery properties 
prior to september we operated cemeteries under management agreements and have subsequently converted five of these cemetery associations one in september and in april into for profit entities owned by us and ceased operating these cemeteries under management agreements 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation income taxes 
our historical financial statements include the effects of applicable us federal and state income taxes in order to comply with gaap 
we are a limited partnership that has elected to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and therefore not be subject to us federal or applicable state income taxes 
see material tax consequences included in our registration statement on form s registration no 
filed with the sec 
in order to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  at least of our gross income must be qualifying income  which includes income from the sale of real property  including burial lots with and without installed vaults and grave marker bases  lawn and 
table of contents mausoleum crypts and cremation niches 
most of our activities that do not generate qualifying income  such as the sale of other cemetery products  the provision of perpetual care services  the operation of our managed cemeteries and all funeral home operations  will be owned by and conducted through these corporate subsidiaries  which will be subject to tax on their net taxable income 
dividends we receive from corporate subsidiaries will be qualifying income 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of cornerstone and the consolidated financial statements of stonemor partners lp we prepared these financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and known facts and other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continue to make similar estimates  judgments and assumptions on the same basis as we have historically 
our actual results in future periods may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following accounting policies or estimates had or will have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
at need sales of cemetery interment rights  merchandise and services and at need sales of funeral home merchandise and services are recognized as revenues when the interment rights or merchandise is delivered or the services are performed 
revenues from pre need sales of cemetery interment rights in constructed burial property are deferred until at least of the sales price has been collected 
revenues from pre need sales of cemetery interment rights in unconstructed burial property  such as mausoleum crypts and lawn crypts  are deferred until at least of the sales price has been collected  at which time revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires us to estimate the percentage of completion as of the balance sheet date and future costs including estimates for future inflation 
changes to our estimates of the percentage of completion or the related future costs would impact the amount of recognized and deferred revenues 
revenues from pre need sales of cemetery merchandise and services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered title to the merchandise is transferred to the customer and the merchandise is either installed or stored  at the direction of the customer  at the vendor s warehouse or a third party warehouse at no additional cost to us or the services are performed 
investment earnings generated by funds that are required to be deposited into merchandise trusts  including realized gains and losses  in connection with pre need sales of cemetery merchandise and services are deferred until the associated merchandise is delivered or the services are performed 
we defer recognition of the direct costs associated with pre need sales of cemetery products and services 
direct costs are those costs that vary with and are directly related to obtaining new pre need cemetery business and the actual cost of the products and services we sell 
direct costs are expensed when the related revenues are recognized 
until that time  direct costs are reflected on our balance sheet in deferred selling and obtaining costs and deferred cemetery revenues  net 
earnings from the perpetual care trusts are recognized  as earned  in cemetery revenues and are used to defray cemetery maintenance costs  which are expensed as incurred 
allowance for cancellations 
allowances for cancellations arising from non payment of pre need contracts are estimated at the date of sale based upon our historical cancellation experience 
because of the number of estimates and projections used in determining an expected cancellation rate and the possibility of changes in collection patterns resulting from modifications to our collection policies or contract terms  actual collections could differ from these estimates 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we monitor the recoverability of long lived assets  including cemetery property  property and equipment and other assets  based on estimates using factors such as current market value  future asset utilization  business and regulatory climate and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the related assets 
our policy is to record an impairment loss in the period when it is determined that the sum of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
modifications to our estimates could result in our recording impairment charges in future periods 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  whereas additions and major replacements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we estimate that the useful lives of our buildings and improvements are to years  that the useful lives of our furniture and equipment are to years and that the useful lives of our leasehold improvements are the respective terms of the leases 
these estimates could be impacted in the future by changes in market conditions or other factors 
income taxes 
we make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
we also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  recent cumulative losses and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
we expect to reduce the amount of our taxable income as a result of our treatment as a partnership for us federal tax purposes 
however  some of our operations will continue to be conducted through corporate subsidiaries that will be subject to applicable us federal and state income taxes 
accordingly  changes in our income tax plans and estimates may impact our earnings in future periods 
as of december  stonemor partners lp  and its affiliated group of corporate subsidiaries had a consolidated federal net operating loss carryover of approximately million and state net operating losses of approximately million 
these federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in and  respectively  and are available to reduce future taxable income of our taxable subsidiaries that would otherwise be subject to federal income taxes 
our ability to use such federal net operating losses may be limited by changes in the ownership of our units deemed to result in an ownership change under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code 
while we do not anticipate that an ownership change will occur prior to december   the date by which we expect the majority of our federal net operating losses to be completely utilized  we cannot assure you that such ownership change will not occur 
if an ownership change should occur during this period  an increase in tax liabilities of our corporate subsidiaries could result  which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders 
furthermore  in order to avoid the consequences of an ownership change  we may refrain from making some acquisitions that we otherwise would finance at least in part with additional units or the proceeds of an offering of common units 
as a result  we may be less able to implement our acquisition growth strategy during the next three years

an additional contribution to the increase in cemetery revenue from pre need sales was higher accumulated earnings from merchandise trusts allocated to the pre need products delivered during total revenues from merchandise and perpetual care trust for were higher by million than the increase in the deliveries of pre need products and services in was a result of management s continuation of cash flow management initiatives initiated in these increases were offset by a decrease in interest income of million and decreased marker sales of million
