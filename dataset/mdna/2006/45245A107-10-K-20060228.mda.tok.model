item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview imation is a leading provider of removable data storage media products designed to help customers capture  create  protect  preserve  and retrieve valuable digital assets 
our business to business customers range from managers of large data centers to distributed network administrators to small business owners who rely on our tape cartridges for data processing  security  business continuity  backup and archiving applications 
for personal storage needs  our customers rely on our recordable optical discs  usb enabled flash and removable hard drives to store  edit and manage business data  photos  video  images  and music on professional and home desktops 
our products are sold in the us and in approximately other countries 
approximately percent of our revenue came from outside the us the data storage market presents attractive growth opportunities as well as challenges 
the market is highly competitive  characterized by continuing changes in technology  ongoing and variable price erosion  diverse distribution channels  and a large variety of formats for tape  optical  flash  and removable hard disk products 
we deliver a broad portfolio of products across diverse distribution channels and geographies 
success in the market is dependent on being early to market with new formats  having efficient manufacturing  sourcing and supply chain operations  maintaining competitive total delivered cost  working closely with leading oems to develop new formats or enhancements to existing formats  offering a broad assortment of products across multiple competing drive technology platforms  and having broad geographic and market coverage across diverse distribution channels 
while the demand for data storage media continues to grow at a modest rate  the highest revenue growth opportunities include newer tape formats in open system environments  recordable optical discs and removable flash memory 
these higher revenue growth opportunities provide revenue streams that are typically at lower gross profit margins than our historical gross margins on the magnetic media businesses 
our strategy is to take advantage of these growth opportunities by establishing strategic sourcing  brand distribution  and licensing arrangements and by implementing a relatively flat and efficient operating structure 
for example  while we have manufacturing operations  intellectual property  including patents and know how  across a broad range of storage related media technologies  we also source some products from third party manufacturers 
as a result  our business is a combination of a manufacturer and a brand distributor 
we believe this strategy can support higher revenue without the need to add substantial infrastructure or overhead costs  thus delivering increased gross margin dollars and operating profit growth on increased revenue 
we launched various restructuring activities in to lower overall operating costs  simplify structure  and improve decision making speed 
in addition  we are implementing lean enterprise principles throughout our organization 
the emphasis of lean enterprise principles is speed  quality  and competitive cost across all key functions and processes

net revenue increased percent in over compared to a percent increase in over total worldwide revenue growth over was driven by volume increases of approximately percent and foreign currency benefit of approximately one percent partially offset by price declines of approximately percent 
the revenue increase in was driven by growth in our optical products  including our gdm joint venture with mbi  flash media and certain tape cartridge formats  particularly lto and lto total worldwide revenue growth over was driven by volume increases of approximately percent and foreign currency benefit of approximately three percent partially offset by price declines of approximately percent

gross profit increased in by million from  while gross profit decreased by million from to the gross margin was substantially in line with the gross margin  but the margin was impacted by certain items discussed below 
the percentage point decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue for over was in part due to a higher proportion of lower gross margin products in the overall sales mix 
two other factors also negatively impacting gross margin in were million of inventory related charges and start up costs related to our coating facility in weatherford  oklahoma 
the inventory related charges were driven by competitive market pricing during the second quarter of  which caused inventory valuation write downs of million recorded as cost of goods sold and price protection payments of million recorded as reductions of revenue made in order to expand and retain certain retail business 
the start up costs were incurred as costs were added ahead of the commencement of production and scale up of production on our new coater 
the scale up and improvement of performance of the new coater caused gross margin to improve by percentage points when comparing and this improvement  however  was more than offset by the decrease in gross margin due to a higher proportion of lower gross margin products in the overall sales mix

the charges included the costs for employee separation programs related to a headcount reduction of approximately employees  of which related mainly to the tucson  arizona production facility that we closed in the remaining reduction of employees related to the restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of we also recognized asset impairment charges of million mainly related to the decision to discontinue various product development strategies as development efforts were focused on fewer projects 
in  we recorded a million benefit for the reversal of previously recorded charges due to lower than expected costs of restructuring see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this restructuring adjustment was made as part of our regular practice of reviewing quarterly restructuring reserves and making adjustments as necessary to reflect management s best estimate of costs remaining for each restructuring program 
during  and  we made cash payments of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  related to our restructuring programs

the matter involved the us treatment of tax benefits associated with changes to our european structure initiated in that were approved by us tax authorities in the first quarter of  resulting in the reversal of an income tax accrual 
the tax rate was benefited by a one time tax benefit of million associated with the favorable resolution of a european tax matter  as well as lower taxable income in the united states in part due to restructuring and other charges incurred during the year 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to recover our recorded net deferred tax assets 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations in was million or per basic share and per diluted share  in was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  and in was million  or per basic share and per diluted share

financial position as of december   the cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million compared to december  we also had other investments  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  related to investment grade interest bearing securities with original maturities greater than three months that are classified as other current assets or other assets depending on the time remaining to maturity 
our cash and investments increase was primarily attributed to operating cash flows of million  proceeds of million from option exercises and proceeds of million from the sale of the specialty papers business partially offset by share repurchases of million and dividend payments of million 
the accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days as of december   compared to days as of december  days sales outstanding is calculated using the count back method  which calculates the number of days of most recent revenue that is reflected in the net accounts receivable balance 
we had days of inventory supply on hand as of december  compared to days as of december  days of inventory supply is calculated using the current period inventory balance divided by the average of the inventoriable portion of cost of goods sold for the previous months  expressed in days 
there are a few areas in which we expect some modest inventory increases in early  especially in optical products 
in late  we entered into a tape media distribution agreement with exabyte corp 
exabyte  whereby we became the exclusive distributor of exabyte media including the vxa class of tape cartridges 
this transaction resulted in an intangible asset of million 
on october   we amended certain terms of the exabyte distribution agreement whereby imation agreed to lower the margin we earned on distribution in exchange for consideration of million in the form of exabyte common stock  preferred stock  warrants  and notes receivable with a corresponding offset to the original intangible asset recorded in conjunction with the execution of the original exabyte distribution agreement 
other assets were million as of december  compared to million as of december  this decrease was primarily caused by maturation of certain cash investments  which caused them to move from long term to short term in an amount of million  as well as a decrease in deferred income taxes of million and a decrease in intangible assets of million due to the amended exabyte distribution agreement 
accrued payroll was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase was caused by higher accruals for broad based employee incentive compensation plans 
other current liabilities were million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease was caused primarily by a reduction in of million related to the settlement of jazz photo litigation recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements as well as a reduction of million due to payments for employee separation costs see note to the consolidated financial statements

the establishment and growth in our joint venture with gdm  whose financial statements are consolidated into our financial statements  increased total accounts receivable by million and accounts payable by million 
the overall increase in accounts receivable of million including gdm was nearly offset by an increase in accounts payable of million including gdm  both primarily driven by optical growth 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  as compared to cash used in investing activities of million in and million in capital spending totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the capital spending in was primarily related to the installation of a new tape coating line at our weatherford  oklahoma plant site

table of contents as of december  and  we did not have any debt outstanding 
we maintain a credit agreement with a group of banks that expires december  the credit agreement provides for revolving credit  including letters of credit  with borrowing availability of million 
the credit agreement provides for  at our option  borrowings at either a floating interest rate based on a defined prime rate or a fixed rate related to the eurodollar rate  plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the margins over the defined prime rate and eurodollar rate range from zero to percent and to percent  respectively 
letter of credit fees are equal to the eurodollar margins 
a facility fee ranging from to percent per annum and a utilization fee ranging from zero to percent per annum based on our consolidated leverage ratio is payable on the line of credit 
in conjunction with the credit agreement  we have pledged percent of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
covenants include maintenance of a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  a required ebitda  and a maximum leverage ratio 
we do not expect these covenants to materially restrict our ability to borrow funds in the future 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december   and we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
we are in the process of expanding our bank credit facility from the current level of million to a higher level of approximately million to million 
in addition  certain international subsidiaries have borrowings locally outside of the credit agreement discussed above 
as of december  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under such arrangements 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares of our common stock and in increased the authorization to a total of million shares 
on august   our board of directors increased the authorization for repurchase of common stock  expanding the then remaining share repurchase authorization of million shares as of june   to a total of six million shares 
during   and  we repurchased million shares  million shares  and million shares  respectively 
as of december   we had repurchased million shares under the latest authorization and held  in total  million shares of treasury stock acquired at an average price of per share 
authorization for repurchases of an additional million shares remains outstanding as of december  we paid cash dividends of per share or million during  per share or million during and per share or million in any future dividends are at the discretion of and subject to the approval of imation s board of directors 
we contributed million to our defined benefit pension plans during based on this funding  as well as the market performance on plan assets  we ended with an aggregate unfunded status of these plans of million  an improvement from the million aggregate unfunded status at the end of we expect pension contributions to be in the range of million to million in  depending on asset performance and interest rates 
we estimate that we have pension contributions of approximately million required by statute for our liquidity needs in include the following the memorex acquisition cost of million and other related acquisition costs including possible restructuring costs  capital expenditures targeted to be in a range of million to million  pension funding of approximately million to million  operating lease payments of approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statements  and any amounts associated with the repurchase of common stock under the authorization discussed above or any dividends that may be paid upon approval of the board of directors 
we expect that cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flow from operations and availability of borrowings under our current and future sources of financing  will provide liquidity sufficient to meet these needs and for our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating lease commitments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are not using off balance sheet arrangements  including special purpose entities  nor do we have any contractual obligations or commercial commitments with terms greater than one year  that would significantly impact our liquidity 

table of contents summary of contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the majority of the purchase obligations consist of day rolling estimates 
each month  we provide various suppliers with rolling forecasts of our demand for products for the next three months 
the forecasted amounts are generally binding on us as follows for the first month  for the second month  and for the third month 
except for the sale leaseback payments recorded in long term liabilities  timing of payments for the vast majority of the remaining long term liabilities  primarily consisting of pension liabilities  cannot be reasonably determined and as such have been included in the more than years category 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances when preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in the results of operations is different than that reported on the tax return ie  the cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which the expense has already been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established against those deferred tax assets 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some portion of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december   resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
deferred tax 
table of contents liabilities generally represent items for which a deduction has already been taken in the tax return  but the items have not been recognized as expenses in the results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions  and in determining the provision for income taxes  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and we recognize we may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
the reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
we believe that the current tax reserves of million are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from current estimates and assumptions and could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would likely require the use of cash 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the future 
significant tax loss carryforwards have been generated in the netherlands for the years the filing of the related tax returns resulted in a nil assessment from the dutch tax authorities on carryforwards representing a possible tax benefit of approximately million 
this results in no tax loss carryforward from the viewpoint of the dutch tax authorities 
the issuance of the assessment notice resulted in imation reporting no tax loss carryforwards relating to these losses 
however  we are pursuing opportunities to resolve the validity of some or all of these amounts 
in the event we are successful  a discrete tax benefit will be realized in the period of settlement 
we are unable to estimate the possible benefit or timing of resolution 
litigation management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  management believes that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  would not be material to our financial position 
as additional information becomes available  potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
excess inventory and obsolescence accruals we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolescence to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
as of december   the excess inventory and obsolescence accruals were million 
rebates we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
other accrued liabilities we also have other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to us 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and projected salary increases 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions for both the us and international plans 
the discount rate assumptions are tied to portfolios of long term high quality bonds and are therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher 
table of contents pension expense 
the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation in the us was percent at december  as compared to percent at december  and percent at december  a discount rate reduction of percent increases us pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the respective portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
we use historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
in and  we used an expected return on assets assumption for the us portfolio of percent 
during  given the poor performance of the us equity markets  we lowered the expected rate of return assumption to percent 
this rate was used in calculating the expenses for and and was also used for a change of percent for the expected return on plan assets assumption will impact us net pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  we have used the rate of percent for the past three years 
mortality assumptions were obtained from the group mortality table 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments will no longer be an alternative 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after june  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective transition method in our first fiscal quarter of  which begins january  in addition to the recognition of expense in the financial statements  under sfas r  any excess tax benefits received upon exercise of options will be presented as a financing activity inflow rather than as an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented 
based on our current analysis and information  we have determined that the impact of adopting sfas r will result in a reduction of net earnings in the range of million to million or to per diluted earnings per share on a full year basis for fiscal in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 

this interpretation provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event 
this interpretation requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
we have completed our assessment of the effects of repatriating a portion of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and did not repatriate any undistributed earnings under the act in 
table of contents in november  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price changes  and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political instability  the possibility of expropriation  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures  and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot assure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets  and the availability of hedging instruments 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
an immediate adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables including interest rates held constant would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million 

table of contents our exposure to commodity price changes relates primarily to certain manufacturing operations that utilize aluminum ingot and petroleum based products 
we manage our exposure to changes in these prices through our procurement and sales practices 
significant unexpected increases in the price of or decreases in the supply of these products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments and foreign currency derivatives 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we monitor and manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with each counterparty in accordance with our internal policies
