specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted  and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment 
revenue recognition we have many different revenue sources  each governed by specific revenue recognition policies 
our revenue recognition policies can be found in item  note to our consolidated financial statements 
additional discussion of our recognition of gains on sales of mortgage assets follows 
gains on sales of mortgage assets we sell substantially all of the non prime mortgage loans we originate to the trusts  which are qualifying special purpose entities qspes  with servicing rights generally retained 
prime mortgage loans are sold in loan sales  servicing released  to third party buyers 
gains on sales of mortgage assets are recognized when control of the assets is surrendered when loans are sold to the trusts and are based on the difference between cash proceeds and the allocated cost of the assets sold  including any guarantees or recourse obligations 
other components of gain on sales of mortgage loans include gains or losses on derivatives  loan sale repurchase reserves and direct origination and acquisition expenses 
we determine the allocated cost of assets sold based on the relative fair values of cash proceeds  msrs  any guarantee or recourse liabilities to be recorded at the date of sale and the beneficial interest in trusts  which represents our residual interest in the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the trusts 
the relative fair value of the msrs and the beneficial interest in trust is determined using discounted cash flow models  which require various management assumptions  limited by the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the trusts see discussion below in valuation of residual interests and valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the following is an example of a hypothetical gain on sale calculation in s acquisition cost of underlying mortgage loans fair values net proceeds beneficial interest in trusts msrs computation of gain on sale net proceeds less allocated cost   x  recorded gain on sale recorded beneficial interest in trusts   x  recorded value of msrs   x  variations in the assumptions we use affect the estimated fair values and the reported gains on sales 
gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
see discussion in off balance sheet financing arrangements related to the disposition of the loans by the trusts and subsequent securitization by the company 
valuation of residual interests we use discounted cash flow models to determine the estimated fair values of our residual interests 
we develop our assumptions for expected credit losses  prepayment speeds  discount rates and interest rates based on historical experience and third party market sources 
variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values  which may require us to record impairments or unrealized gains 
in addition  variations will also affect the amount of residual interest accretion recorded on a monthly basis 
available for sale afs residual interests valued at million and million were recorded as of april  and  respectively 
we recorded million in net write ups in other comprehensive income and million in impairments in the income statement related to these residual interests during fiscal year as actual performance differed from our assumptions
