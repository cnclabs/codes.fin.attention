item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and selected financial data of the company included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general the company is a leading supplier of products and services to the aerospace industry worldwide  including the provisioning and the supply of aircraft parts and components  and supply chain management services 
the company also builds custom hose assemblies  and performs overhaul and repair services for brakes and starters generators 
the company recorded an increase in revenues for the year ended january   as the result of an improving market in some sectors  an expanded product line  and its ability to effectively compete 
for the full year  increased gross profit margins and effective cost controls produced quarterly and full year profitability 
cash levels decreased primarily due to the inventory purchases to expand the product lines  expenditures for equipment and enterprise software  accelerated payments to obtain vendor price discounts  and repurchase of the company s subsidiary preferred stock 
the company believes that its results show that it continues to take market share from its competitors  as it managed to grow and maintain profitability in difficult markets 
results for the three months ended january  produced the company s second highest quarterly revenues for this year and record quarterly gross margin  while maintaining costs at prior year s levels 
recovery in the industry has been sporadic since  and overall business activity in the aerospace industry continues to be influenced by several factors  including higher fuel prices 
although the extent and timing of further increases in market activity is uncertain  the company continues to look for opportunities for new markets and revenues  increased margins  improved cost controls  and expanded service offerings 
critical accounting policies the company is required to provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions to determine the measurement of revenues and expenses  and the realizable value of certain assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
the estimates and assumptions could change significantly as conditions within and beyond management s control change 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates 
the most significant estimates made in preparing the company s financial statements include revenue recognition  the determination of the allowance for doubtful trade receivables  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred income tax asset valuations  and the valuation of goodwill 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and the related judgments  estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition the company s net sales consist of sales of services to the aviation industry  including parts and components supply services  supply chain management services  and component overhaul and repair services 
net sales are recorded when parts and components are shipped and title transfers to the customer  when supply chain management services have been provided to the customer  or when overhauled and repaired items are completed and shipped back to the customer 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales 
the terms and nature of supply chain management services are stipulated in a long term contract between the company and the customer 
the company provides its facilities  personnel and systems to provide cost effective services to the customer 
in providing services where the company distributes inventory on behalf of its customer  the company may use its own inventory or hold its customers inventory without taking ownership of such inventory 
in cases where the company does not take ownership of its customers inventory  net sales generally are recognized as a fee based on the sales value of the product shipped through the company s facilities  and not the sales value of the product itself 
alternatively  the company  when providing services to handle customers inventory without taking ownership  can take a fee based on the cost of providing services  and not on the sales value of the product 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful trade receivables is established based on estimates of the amount of uncollectible trade receivables  utilizing financial formulas based principally upon historical experience  the credit worthiness of the customer  the age of the account  the estimated risk that the account can be collected  and specific identification 
also  receivables arising from export activities may be supported by foreign credit insurance 
collection of trade receivables is affected by aviation industry and market trends  overall economic trends and conditions  and customers credit issues and financial condition 
changes in any of these factors may have a significant negative impact upon the estimated allowance  and the company s financial performance 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventories inventories generally consist of aircraft parts and components  and are valued at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
provisions are made in each period for the estimated effect of excess and obsolete inventories based upon financial formulas that take into account quantities  costs  the age of the inventory on hand  historical and projected sales  and other inventory movements  adjusted for known or estimated factors such as new product lines and product return allowances 
during the three months ended july   as a result of normal review procedures  the company adjusted the methodology for estimating the allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory that makes the estimate more objective  and efficient to calculate  by applying percentages based on historical experiences of inventory in various age classifications  and eliminating the practice of making adjustments based on historical and projected sales  or other inventory movements due to new product lines and product return allowances 
as a result of this review  the company increased inventory reserves 
actual excess and obsolete inventories may differ significantly from such estimates  and such differences could have a significant negative impact on the estimated allowance  and the company s financial performance 
deferred income taxes the company uses the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are estimated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of the assets is subject to estimates and judgments  and may change based upon a variety of factors  including future profitability of the company and tax law changes 
if an asset is not deemed more likely than not to be fully realizable  a valuation allowance must be established against all or part of the asset 
in addition  fas requires the establishment of a valuation allowance under certain conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
as originally issued in  sfas no 
established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income loss would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
the company will be required to apply sfas no 
r at the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june   and plans to adopt it effective february  the impact of adoption of statement r on future periods cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the stock based compensation section of the summary of significant accounting policies note statement r has alternative transitional methods for adoption and the company has not determined which transitional alternative it will use

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise principally from its working capital needs 
in addition  the company has liquidity requirements to fund capital expenditures to support its current operations  and facilitate growth and expansion 
the company funds its liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and from borrowings 
cash and cash equivalents at any time may consist of a combination of demand deposits  money market or short term  high grade bond funds  and short term certificates of deposit 
the reduction in cash for the year ended january  was principally the result of inventory purchases to expand the company s product line offerings  purchases of equipment and software  and the repurchase by api of subsidiary preferred stock 
the company believes it maintains a strong balance sheet 
the company s cash used in operations for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in operations for the year ended january  was impacted by increases in inventory due to a large purchase of inventory parts from a leading aircraft oem  and additional inventory opportunity buys to secure price or volume discounts  and an increase in trade receivables offset by an increase in accounts payable 
on september   api made an initial inventory purchase of approximately million 
the oem vendor agreed to partially finance the purchase with two promissory notes from api of million and million  with the company entering into a guarantee agreement to ensure payment by api 
these promissory notes were subsequently amended 
the amended promissory note for million is for a term of years  at interest per annum 
the amended promissory note for million is a non interest bearing short term note due within one year 
the vendor financing promissory notes are subordinated to the company s revolving line of credit 
in addition  subsequent to the initial purchase and pursuant to a separate transaction with the same oem  api made an additional purchase of million of inventory to broaden the product line offering  pursuant to usual vendor terms 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively

first aviation s aggregate cash used for capital expenditures for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in capital requirements in fiscal is the result of current upgrades to the company s enterprise system and equipment to handle current requirements and support the company s growth and expansion 
for fiscal year the amount required for capital expenditures currently is expected to range between million and million 
management expects to fund these requirements from cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and from borrowings 
effective july  api entered into a new million revolving line of credit facility which under certain conditions may be increased to million  through a commercial revolving loan and security agreement agreement 
this agreement which expires on september  replaces the company s prior facility which was scheduled to expire july  borrowings under this facility bear interest equal to libor plus and are limited to specified percentages of eligible trade receivables and inventories of api 
the agreement contains a number of covenants  including restrictions on mergers  consolidations and acquisitions  the incurrence of indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  the creation of liens  and limitations on capital expenditures 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement  the payment of dividends on api s common stock is prohibited  except with the lender s consent  and api is required to maintain minimum levels of net worth and specified interest expense coverage ratios 
substantially all of api s domestic assets are pledged as collateral under the facility  and first aviation guarantees all borrowings under the agreement 
in october  the line was increased to million under provisions of the agreement as a result of a large inventory purchase made by the company in september at january   borrowings under the facility totaled million  at an interest rate of approximately 
of the million  million represented a draw on the facility just prior to january  the company would regularly draw down on the facility just prior to quarter end and year end  hold the cash  and then repay the amount drawn shortly thereafter 
the purpose was to show cash availability for potential acquisitions or other investment oppurtunities 
the company is currently using the facility more for inventory investment and working capital requirements 
this represents a more frequent use of the line that will increase borrowing costs 
approximately million was available under the facility at january  the new facility extended the maturity to september   therefore  borrowings under the facility are classified as long term 
management believes that the carrying amount of the company s borrowings approximates fair market value because the interest rate is variable and resets frequently 
based upon current and anticipated levels of operations  the company believes that its cash on hand and cash flow from operations  combined with borrowings available under its line of credit  will be sufficient to meet its current and anticipated cash operating requirements through the year ending january   including scheduled interest payments  working capital needs  and capital expenditures 
on january   the company announced that its board of directors  in light of the company s cash position  had approved a special cash dividend of per share 
the dividend was paid on january  the total paid was million 
the company previously had not declared nor paid any cash dividends or distributions on its common stock since its inception in in addition  api s credit facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends from it to first aviation without the lender s consent 
at this time  the company anticipates that all future earnings will be retained for use in the company s business 
any payment of cash dividends in the future on the company s common stock will be dependent upon the company s financial condition  its results of operations  current and anticipated cash requirements  plans for expansion  the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make cash payments or advances to it as described above  and restrictions  if any  under any future debt obligations  as well as any other factors that the board of directors deems relevant 
in conjunction with the company s acquisition of api in  amr combs  inc amr combs purchased  shares of api series a convertible preferred stock  par value  with annual dividends of per share  payable quarterly the convertible preferred stock 
on march   amr combs was acquired by signature flight support  an affiliate of bba group plc 
on june   all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock were repurchased by the company for  the difference between the carrying value and the purchase price was recorded as additional paid in capital

off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period less than more than amounts in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations   notes payable    operating lease obligations     purchase obligations   total     notes to contractual obligations data long term debt consists of api s revolving line of credit through a commercial revolving loan and security agreement as described in liquidity and capital resources  above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s canadian operations utilize the canadian dollar as their functional currency  while the company s asian operation utilizes the us dollar as its functional currency 
the company has transactions denominated in canadian dollars and philippine pesos 
the company is exposed to market risk from foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency transaction exposure principally arises from the transfer of foreign currency to and or from us dollars from one subsidiary to another within the company  and from foreign currency denominated trade receivables 
currency transaction and translation exposures are not hedged 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings  and gains or losses will increase in significance with the growth of the canadian operations 
unrealized currency translation gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign subsidiaries balance sheets to us dollars are not recorded as income or expense  but are recognized in the balance sheet as other comprehensive income or loss as a component of stockholder s equity 
the company does have risk principally relating to the translation of accounts in which the canadian dollar is the functional currency 
sensitivity analysis of foreign currency exchange rate risk assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their level at january   with all other variables held constant 
a strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar would result in a decrease of approximately  in the net liability position of financial instruments at january  a weakening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar would result in a increase of approximately  in the net liability position of financial instruments at january  during the twelve months ended january  the company experienced a comprehensive gain of  due to an increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
the company did not experience any significant changes in market risk during the twelve months ended january  borrowings of the company are denominated in us dollars 
management believes that the carrying amount of the company s borrowings approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reset frequently
