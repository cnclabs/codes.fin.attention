item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto  and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
the financial information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the discontinued operations discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a publicly traded reit which owns  develops  acquires  manages and leases community shopping centers including power centers and single tenant retail properties and one regional mall in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
at december   our portfolio consisted of community shopping centers  of which fifteen are power centers and two are single tenant retail properties  as well as one enclosed regional mall  totaling approximately million square feet of gla 
we own approximately million square feet of such gla  with the remaining portion owned by various anchor stores 
our corporate strategy is to maximize total return for our shareholders by improving operating income and enhancing asset value 
we pursue our goal through a proactive approach to redeveloping  renovating and expanding our shopping centers  the acquisition of community shopping centers  with a focus on grocery and nationally recognized discount department store anchor tenants  the development of new shopping centers in metropolitan markets where we believe demand for a center exists  and a proactive approach to leasing vacant spaces and entering into new leases for occupied spaces when leases are about to expire 
we have followed a disciplined approach to managing our operations by focusing primarily on enhancing the value of our existing portfolio through strategic sales and successful leasing efforts and by improving our capital structure through the refinancing of a portion of our variable rate debt with long term fixed rate debt 
we continue to selectively pursue new acquisitions and development opportunities 

table of contents the highlights of our activity reflect this strategy we acquired nine properties through our joint venture with ing clarion bringing the total centers purchased to date to twelve with an aggregate purchase price of million and comprising over million square feet of gla 
in december  we purchased kissimmee west  a  square foot community shopping center located in kissimmee  florida 
the center is anchored owned by a  square foot super target  and is also anchored by a  square foot joann fabrics and a  square foot marshalls 
we commenced the development of rossford pointe in rossford  ohio and the shoppes of fairlane meadows in dearborn  michigan 
at year end  we also had a number of substantial development projects in process that encompass over million square feet gla 
beacon square in grand haven  michigan and gaines marketplace in gaines township  michigan are substantially complete and the third development project  river city marketplace in jacksonville  florida  is the largest center presently under construction and has over  square feet of gla already leased 
during  we opened new non anchor stores  at an average base rent of per square foot 
we also renewed non anchor leases  at an average base rent of  achieving an increase of over prior rental rates 
additionally  we signed eight new anchor leases during the year 
overall portfolio average base rents increased to in from in same center net operating income increased over the portfolio was leased at year end compared to at year end 
in december  we entered into a new million unsecured credit facility 
during  we retired million of long term debt  with a blended interest rate of and replaced the debt with new loans of million  due in  having a blended interest rate of approximately 
we increased the annual dividend to per share 
the strength of our portfolio combined with acquisitions brought into operation since january  allowed us to increase our total revenue by in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion relates to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
reserve for bad debts we provide for bad debt expense based upon the reserve method of accounting 
we continuously monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable billed  unbilled and straight line from specific tenants  analyze historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in tenant payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
when tenants are in bankruptcy  we make estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb currently estimated bad debts 
however  if we experience bad debts in excess of the reserves we have established  our operating income would be reduced 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition or development of long term assets  or intangible assets subject to amortization  have occurred that indicate the remaining 
table of contents estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows  on a non discounted basis  for the related assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if a write down is appropriate 
if we identify impairment  we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of an impaired asset exceeds its fair value as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances 
in determining the estimated useful lives of intangibles assets with finite lives  we consider the nature  life cycle position  and historical and expected future operating cash flows of each asset  as well as our commitment to support these assets through continued investment 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to our investment in plc novi west development 
this investment was accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
there were no impairment charges for the years ended december  or see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition shopping center space is generally leased to retail tenants under leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
we recognize minimum rents using the straight line method over the terms of the leases commencing when the tenant takes possession of the space 
certain of the leases also provide for additional revenue based on contingent percentage income which is recorded on an accrual basis once the specified target that triggers this type of income is achieved 
the leases also typically provide for tenant recoveries of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
these recoveries are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
revenues from fees and management income are recognized in the period in which the services occur 
lease termination fees are recognized when a lease termination agreement is executed by the parties 
off balance sheet arrangements we have six off balance sheet investments in which we own or less of the total ownership interests 
we provide leasing  development and property management services to the joint ventures 
these investments are accounted for by the equity method 
our level of control of these joint ventures is such that we are not required to include them as consolidated subsidiaries

we  as sole general partner of the operating partnership  have the option  but not the obligation  to settle exchanged op units held by others in cash based on the current trading price of our common shares 
assuming the exchange of all op units  there would have been  of our common shares outstanding at december   with a market value of approximately million based on the closing price of per share on december  
as part of our business plan to improve our capital structure and reduce debt  we will continue to pursue the strategy of selling fully valued properties and to dispose of shopping centers that no longer meet the criteria established for our portfolio 
our ability to obtain acceptable selling prices and satisfactory terms will impact the timing of future sales 
net proceeds from the sale of properties are expected to reduce outstanding debt and to fund any future acquisitions 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations  also known as ffo  an appropriate supplemental measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
under the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  definition  ffo represents net income  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gain loss on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate investments  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions and many companies utilize different depreciable lives and methods 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  acquisition and development activities and interest costs  which provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  ffo does not include the cost of capital improvements  including capitalized interest 
for the reasons described above we believe that ffo provides us and our investors with an important indicator of our operating performance 
this measure of performance is used by us for several business purposes and for reits it provides a recognized measure of performance other than gaap net income  which may include non cash items 
other real estate companies may calculate ffo in a different manner 
we recognize ffo s limitations when compared to gaap s net income 
ffo does not represent amounts available for needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
we do not use ffo as an indicator of our cash obligations and funding requirements for future commitments  acquisition or development activities 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  including the payment of dividends 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is simply used as an additional indicator of our operating performance 

table of contents the following table illustrates the calculations of ffo in thousands  except per share data years ended december  net income add depreciation and amortization expense gain loss on sale of depreciable property minority interest in partnership continuing operations discontinued operations less discontinued operations  gain on sale of property  net of minority interest funds from operations less preferred stock dividends funds from operations available to common shareholders weighted average equivalent shares outstanding  diluted funds from operations available for common shareholders  per diluted share inflation inflation has been relatively low in recent years and has not had a significant detrimental impact on our results of our operation 
should inflation rates increase in the future  substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation 
such lease provisions include clauses that require our tenants to reimburse us for real estate taxes and many of the operating expenses we incur 
also  many of our leases provide for periodic increases in base rent which are either of a fixed amount or based on changes in the consumer price index and or percentage rents where the tenant pays us rent based on a percentage of its sales 
we believe that any inflationary increases in our expenses should be substantially offset by increased expense reimbursements  contractual rent increases and or increased receipts from percentage rents 
therefore  we expect the effects of inflation and other changes in prices would not have a material impact on the results of our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

table of contents an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt obligations 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or other material rate or price risks 
based on our debt and interest rates and the interest rate swap agreements in effect at december   a basis point change in interest rates would affect our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
we believe that a base point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our total outstanding debt 
under terms of various debt agreements  we may be required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements for notional amounts aggregating million provide for fixed rates of and expire in december the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning our long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates of maturing amounts and fair market value 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate we estimated the fair value of our fixed rate mortgages using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements with the same remaining maturity 
considerable judgment is required to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments 
the 
table of contents table incorporates only those exposures that exist at december  and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date or firm commitments as of such date 
therefore  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
our actual interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates
