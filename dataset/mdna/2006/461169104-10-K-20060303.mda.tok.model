market opportunity the surgical vision correction market vision correction represents one of the largest medical markets in the united states 
according to market scope  approximately million people in the united states require some form of vision correction  and industry sources estimate that approximately billion was spent on eyeglasses  contact lenses and other corrective eyewear in the united states in of the approximately million people in the united states who require vision correction  approximately million people  or million eyes  are eligible for surgical vision correction and have not yet been treated 
lasik surgery is the most common means of surgical vision correction 
according to market scope  approximately of all refractive surgical vision corrections today are lasik corrections 
lasik surgery corrects refractive errors associated with myopia  the inability to see objects in the distance  and hyperopia  the inability to see up close  by reshaping the cornea 
approximately million people  or million eyes  are myopic  also called nearsighted  and approximately million people  or million eyes  are hyperopic  also called farsighted 
both of these common vision problems are caused by irregularities in the shape of the eye  called refractive errors 
the vision problem which typically requires reading glasses is called presbyopia and is not treated with lasik surgery 
the market for lasik surgery is currently under penetrated 
to date  only about million lasik eye surgeries have been performed in the united states  which amounts to a nominal market penetration rate of approximately 
the total us annual market size for lasik surgery is approximately billion  based on an estimated million lasik procedures expected to be performed in at an industry average price of approximately  per eye treated 
industry analysts expect the growth rate in us lasik procedures to be approximately in  based on approximately  more procedures expected in than were performed in outside the united states there were approximately million surgical vision surgeries performed in  primarily lasik 
industry analysts expect the growth rate outside the united states in lasik procedures to be approximately in  to approximately million procedures  with lasik volume concentrated in europe and the asia pacific region 
we believe lasik surgery procedure volume and market penetration will be driven by the following factors technology advances 
lasik surgery has grown in procedure volume as successive technological innovations have improved safety  efficacy and visual acuity  increasing surgeon and patient confidence in lasik surgery 
two recent technological advances are the laser created corneal flap and the custom correction procedure 
demographics 
as the general population grows  and an increasing number of young people with visual problems reach an age where their eye conditions stabilize  the pool of people eligible for lasik surgery will continue to be replenished 
economic factors 
since patients typically pay for lasik surgery directly with their own discretionary funds  instead of through insurance programs or government reimbursement  general changes in economic conditions will affect the number of people willing and able to purchase the procedure 
the intralase market opportunity there are approximately  lasik surgery practices worldwide 
of these surgery practices  our key target customers are the  most active lasik surgery practices in the united states and in key international markets 
as of 
table of contents december   approximately of these  lasik surgery practices worldwide were intralase customers  and  of the total number of lasik procedures performed in the united states in the three months ended december   approximately were performed using our product offering to create the corneal flap 
we believe the other approximately of total procedures performed in this time period were performed using the traditional microkeratome 
us market there are approximately  lasik surgeons in the united states who are expected to perform million lasik procedures in these procedures are performed in approximately  us lasik surgery practices  of which approximately perform over procedures per month  largely concentrated in lasik surgery practices owned by individual surgeons or group surgery practices and corporate centers 
international market outside the united states there are approximately  lasik surgery practices that are expected to perform over million lasik procedures in we estimate that there are approximately lasik surgery practices performing over lasik procedures per month in our primary target markets in the asia pacific region  europe and the middle east 
lasik surgery lasik surgery involves two steps first step a thin flap of tissue is created on the surface of the cornea 
this is called a corneal flap 
traditionally  this first step has been done manually by the lasik surgeon using a hand held mechanical device called a microkeratome with a metal razor blade that oscillates across the face of the cornea at high speed 
microkeratomes are manufactured and sold by companies such as bausch lomb  moria microtech  advanced medical optics and nidek 
our solution replaces microkeratomes in this first step with a computer controlled laser 
the intralase fs laser optically focuses its beam of light at a focal point below the surface of the cornea to create the corneal flap 
second step once the corneal flap has been created  the surgeon then folds it back and a computer controlled excimer laser is used to remove  or ablate  tissue from the surface of the cornea to reshape the eye to correct the patient s vision 
excimer lasers are manufactured and sold by companies such as advanced medical optics  alcon  nidek  bausch lomb and wavelight 
recently  excimer laser manufacturers introduced a more precise form of measuring the refractive aberrations of a particular eye with a device called a wavefront device 
they then map these precise measurements into a software program to more precisely reshape the cornea to correct vision 
this improvement to reshaping the cornea with an excimer laser is commonly called a custom correction 
both steps are necessary for lasik surgery 
excimer lasers  used in the second step  remove tissue at the point the beam of light comes into contact with tissue and are not capable of focusing below the surface of the clear eye tissue to create the corneal flap 
therefore  the intralase fs laser used in the first step and the excimer lasers used in the second step are complementary in lasik surgery 
while using the microkeratome in the first step of the lasik procedure is a successful and relatively safe procedure  the majority of complications with lasik arise from the use of microkeratomes 
microkeratome complications arise in up to of all lasik procedures  including the most serious complications that may affect the visual outcome in a lasik surgery 

table of contents the intralase solution better medicine and better business our intralase fs laser and proprietary intralasik software complement and improve lasik surgery by providing a computer controlled laser solution as an alternative to the microkeratome for creating flaps in the cornea during the essential first step of lasik surgery 
when the intralase fs laser is combined with the excimer laser used in the second step of the lasik procedure  this results in an all laser lasik solution 
the advantages of our product offering over the traditional method include fewer severe sight threatening complications  greater predictability  greater control  greater precision and uniformity of flap depth 
additional advantages are a more centrally located flap  better sterility and greater likelihood of completed surgeries 
in all of the commercial procedures performed by our customers to date  there have been no reported incidents of loss of corneal tissue free cap or anterior chamber penetration  serious complications historically associated with creation of the corneal flap with a bladed microkeratome 
in addition  the use of our product offering reduces the incidence of less serious complications such as epithelial defects and dry eye 
the disadvantages of our product offering over the traditional microkeratome approach are the higher costs to the lasik surgeon to acquire our product offering and the higher cost to the patient  as well as the additional training that is required for a surgeon to become accustomed to using our technology and slightly higher procedure times  although we believe our planned release of a kilohertz khz fs laser will reduce our procedure times further 
we believe that the advantages of our technology outweigh the disadvantages and give our lasik surgeon customers and their patients a new level of confidence in lasik surgery  which in turn will help further penetrate the market for lasik surgery 
benefits of the intralase solution we offer our surgeon customers and their patients the benefits of better medicine 
lasik surgeons who have adopted the intralase technology are now able to offer their patients improved safety and predictability and  as a result  patients achieve better visual acuity 
surgeons who use our solution also derive the benefits of better business  since they are able to increase their prices and procedure volume  thus enhancing profitability 
the benefits of better medicine and better business are better vision 
patients achieve statistically significant better vision when the intralase fs laser is used in the lasik procedure  as supported in prospective  comparative studies 
in a prospective study  the study design is made in advance of the collection of data  whereas in a retrospective study  a design is applied to existing data 
in two of these prospective studies  the corneal flap for one eye of each patient was created with the intralase fs laser  and the corneal flap for the other eye was created with the microkeratome 
in one study  the participants were treated with standard excimer laser vision correction  and in the other  the other participants were treated with the new custom excimer laser vision correction 
results showed that the eyes treated with the intralase fs laser had better vision and fewer induced aberrations compared to the mechanical  metal bladed microkeratome 
in two other prospective studies  one comparing eyes of patients treated with the intralase fs laser and the other with the microkeratome  and another comparing approximately patients  or eyes  with corneal flaps created by an intralase laser or two types of microkeratomes  similar results were reported 
we believe these better vision results were achieved using our product offering  in part  due to a reduction in the tissue variabilities caused by the microkeratome  which can affect the precision of the excimer laser 
improved safety 
our product offering eliminates loss of corneal tissue free cap and anterior chamber penetration  the most severe complications associated with the creation of the corneal flap with a bladed microkeratome 
seven comparative studies showed improved safety and elimination of certain risks of flap creation with our product offering  when compared to traditional microkeratomes 
additionally  since corneal flaps created with our product offering possess a unique edge profile  they are easily and securely repositioned following the excimer ablation  reducing the possibility of induced visual aberrations and slipped flaps 
greater predictability and accuracy 
the intralase fs laser produces flaps that are accurate within microns  whereas the microkeratome manufacturers report variability of approximately microns with their newer microkeratome models 
nine studies have shown that our approach generated significantly more predictable and accurate flap dimensions  including  most critically  reproducible flap thickness 
this increased accuracy in flap creation preserves corneal tissue by precisely creating optimal flap thickness  and improves the predictability of the overall lasik treatment 
fewer retreatments 
the number of lasik retreatments are significantly lower when our product offering is used to create the corneal flap 
this avoids the patient inconvenience and increased surgeon costs entailed with retreatments 
in one study of eyes treated with the traditional microkeratome  of the eyes required retreatment 
table of contents within months after the initial surgery while in eyes where the intralase fs laser was used  there were no retreatments in an equivalent time period 
in a separate survey of our surgeon customers  retreatment rates were reduced from an average of to an average of when using our product offering 
reduced dry eye 
a frequently reported side effect of lasik surgery is dry eye 
three studies show a significant reduction in dry eye with the use of our product offering 
in the largest of these three studies  comparing lasik procedures with the microkeratome to lasik procedures with the intralase fs laser  patient incidences of dry eye were reduced by 
we believe that this lower occurrence of dry eye is due to our laser creating a uniform and typically thinner flap that does not sever important nerves in the cornea 
higher procedure volume and revenues for our customers 
our surgeon customers receive an average of more per eye when using our product offering instead of the traditional microkeratome 
an independent survey of our us customers in early indicated that our customers experienced a increase in procedure volume and a increase in revenues in the comparable time period during which the industry experienced a increase in procedure volume and a increase in revenues 
patients readily understand the safety profile of the intralase fs laser  are attracted to the concept of a bladeless procedure and surveys of our customers demonstrate that patients are willing to pay for this new level of safety and assurance 
in addition  according to the same independent survey of our customers  with our laser  approximately of our customers improve the rate at which laser vision correction consultations translate into actual surgery from to 
the clinical studies referred to above were each conducted by lasik surgeons who compared the attributes and results of creating the corneal flap using our laser versus with the microkeratome 
the studies ranged in size from to  eyes 
we paid an aggregate of approximately  to the lasik surgeon conducting the studies in two instances  including  in one instance  when we sponsored the study 
we believe a portion of such payments was used to subsidize lower patient fees for patients to agree to participate in the studies 
in addition  to the extent they provide advisory and consulting services to us separate from their work on the studies  or in connection with their presenting their studies  some of these lasik surgeons have been issued options to purchase shares of our common stock  have been paid cash or have been reimbursed for costs 
our strategy our goals are to establish our product offering as the standard of care for corneal flap creation in lasik surgery  and to leverage our technology to develop new products and applications 
key elements of our strategy for achieving these goals include replacing microkeratome with our laser 
we intend to replace the mechanical  metal bladed microkeratome with our intralase fs laser in lasik surgery practices 
our business model is to target the most active lasik surgery practices in the united states and in key international markets to buy or lease our intralase fs laser in order to generate repeat revenues from the sale of our per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface  required in connection with each successive use of our laser 
in addition  we target prestigious teaching institutions and key industry thought leaders to drive adoption of our product offering by other practicing lasik surgeons 
expanding our market share 
we intend to expand our market share for lasik procedures and facilitate the rapid adoption of our product offering by leveraging clinical data that supports the benefits of our product offering and by engaging in marketing activities that target surgeons and optometrists 
we believe these strategies will enable us to sell more of our higher gross margin per procedure fees each inclusive of a disposable patient interface to users of our existing installed base of lasers  in addition to new users of our laser 
an independent survey conducted in indicated that our us surgeon customers had adopted our product offering in of all the lasik procedures they perform 
we estimate that we captured of the us lasik surgery market for creation of the corneal flap in the three months ended december  refining and enhancing our existing product offering 
in the third quarter of intralase doubled the speed of its laser from khz to khz  approximately halving the procedure time  while enabling tighter spot placement which facilitates easier flap lift  enhancing the surgical experience and reducing the potential for post operative inflammatory response 
in addition  intralase introduced a reasonably priced upgrade path to khz for all of its existing customers  completing upgrades in the second half of in february  we again announced a further improvement in our technology  again almost doubling the speed of the laser with the expected introduction of a khz laser in the second quarter of and an upgrade program and fee for all of its existing customers 
we intend to continue to devote resources to improving and optimizing our technology and product offering  with the goal of continuously increasing the safety  accuracy  efficiency and ease of use of our solution 

table of contents developing innovative applications for our technology 
we are currently in the process of developing new therapeutic applications to expand the use of our current technology and product offering 
the intralase fs laser is the first femtosecond laser cleared by the fda for use in intrastromal incisions used with ring implants  lamellar keratoplasty  penetrating keratoplasty and for the preparation of the donor tissue used in corneal transplants 
in january  intralase announced that the first corneal transplant cases using the intralase fs laser had been successfully performed in patients 
the use of intralase s laser to create a contoured  full thickness corneal resection in preparation for corneal transplant has the potential to make corneal transplantation a safer  more precise procedure 
launch of this new therapeutic application is expected in fall we believe the unique capabilities of our laser will enable us to introduce additional applications within ophthalmology 
providing quality products and superior customer service 
we intend to continue to offer high quality products and extensive support to our direct customers and to our international distributors to continue to build our reputation as a premier service provider and establish a loyal customer base 
we believe that providing superior service is instrumental in maintaining and growing our market share  as our surgeon customers often actively refer our product offering to other surgeons 
we currently provide services including a technical support hotline  installation  clinical training and other marketing support services for our direct customers as well as technical and clinical training for our distributors 
we believe our reputation for providing quality products and superior responsiveness will differentiate us from any potential direct competitors 
our product offering our product offering consists of three key elements intralase fs laser  intralasik software  and per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
the creation of the corneal flap using our product offering begins with the set up of the laser  followed by the placement of our disposable patient interface onto the patient s eye 
using the intralasik software  the surgeon then centers a video display of a millimeter circle overlaid on an image of the patient s eye 
once the desired location has been determined and set  the surgeon initiates the flap procedure by engaging the computer controlled laser 
the laser creates the flap by focusing its beam of light below the surface of the corneal tissue  thereby creating a precise cut  leaving an uncut section of tissue to act as a hinge 
it takes approximately seconds for our khz laser to create the corneal flap 
intralase fs laser our intralase fs laser is an ultra fast femtosecond  or fs  laser that produces a stream of high repetition  short duration light pulses with an extremely high quality optical beam 
our khz laser generates thirty thousand pulses per second  with each pulse having a duration of six hundred femtoseconds  the equivalent of less than a billionth of a second per pulse 
our intralasik software controls our laser and beam delivery device that focuses the laser into tiny spots  passing through the outer layers of the cornea until reaching the exact focal point within the cornea 
in an inside out process  the laser beam creates a cut  leaving an uncut section of tissue to act as a hinge 
as with the traditional microkeratome procedure  the surgeon then folds the tissue back to expose the underlying layer of the cornea for the excimer laser treatment that will make the vision correction by reshaping the cornea 
each pulse of light creates a bubble  less than five microns in diameter  a process known as photodisruption 
our laser aligns hundreds of thousands of bubbles contiguously along predetermined three dimensional surfaces to create precise surgical incisions 
because our laser uses low energy pulses and is computer controlled  a very precise surgical procedure is accomplished without damage to the surrounding tissue 
our laser is a solid state laser  meaning that the light pulses are generated using solid state optical materials 
many lasers  including the excimer lasers used for the second step of lasik surgery  produce their pulses of light utilizing a chamber of toxic gas 
by comparison  our solid state laser does not require laser gases or dye to operate and is therefore easier to support at lasik surgery practices 

table of contents our laser is completely self contained  consisting of a laser engine  a delivery system  a user interface and a chassis to house the system 
the laser is extremely compatible for installation in surgical centers  as it requires only a grounded electrical supply 
intralasik software we design  program  test and periodically update our intralasik software that controls the intralase fs laser  which enables the surgeon to make precise cuts at predetermined parameters within the eye s corneal tissue 
each patient s surgical parameters  including flap diameter and thickness  location and angle of the hinge  and angle of the side cut  can be input into the intralasik software prior to surgery 
the software then directs the laser to create a precise corneal flap or perform the selected therapeutic procedure based on the input parameters 
prior to each surgery  the software automatically performs multiple pre procedure system checks to verify the readiness of the laser and multiple calibration checks are also available to the surgeon 
the software allows the surgeon to perform a pre determined number of procedures in conjunction with our per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces separately purchased by the surgeon 
to prevent reuse or unauthorized reproduction of the per procedure disposable patient interface  the software maintains a record of the number of procedures performed and available  and notifies the surgeon when to order additional per procedure disposable patient interfaces 
in addition  the software includes a patient and surgeon database  system utilities and diagnostic tools 
the diagnostic software is also proprietary to us and is used to detect the source of any errors in our laser 
when an error is detected  a message appears with a brief description of the error 
depending upon the severity of the error  the message may provide the user with steps to follow for continued use  or for more technical issues  the information displayed may be used to contact us for diagnostic or on site field service support 
per procedure fee and disposable patient interface a per procedure fee is required for each eye treated 
the per procedure fee is inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
the disposable patient interface consists of a metal cone and glass lens that interfaces between our laser and the patient by attaching to the laser at one end and docking at the other end to the patient s eye  and a proprietary plastic gripper and syringe that is used to locate the glass lens in the metal cone and create suction between the glass lens and the patient s eye 
the disposable patient interface is integral to depth control and accuracy 
the disposable patient interface comes in a sealed  sterile package  which ensures a high level of patient safety and protection from infection 
the disposable patient interface is unique to our laser and we believe that we are the only available source for these devices 
historically  we have protected our per procedure revenue stream with a combination of contract terms  software controls and manual periodic counts of machine usage  as necessary  to compare our shipments of disposable patient interfaces with the individual counter embedded in each intralase fs laser 
during we and our international distributors converted approximately of intralase fs lasers to new software versions that require either remote electronic activation when the customer orders procedures or an intralase generated secure activation code used by the customer at their site 
these methods allow the customer to perform only the number of procedures purchased  which we believe to be a more scalable and secure method of securing our per procedure revenue stream 
for further discussion  see risk factors risks related to our business measures we take to ensure collection of per procedure charges may be inadequate 
in addition  the electronic link facilitates remote software upgrades and in the future we intend to offer our customers new features  such as remote diagnostics using this electronic link 
sales and marketing our primary objective is to rapidly expand our market share for the creation of corneal flaps in the first step of lasik surgery 
of the  lasik surgery practices in the united states  approximately perform over procedures per month 
of the  lasik surgery practices outside the united states  we estimate that there are approximately laser centers performing over lasik procedures per month in our primary international target markets in the asia pacific region  europe and the middle east 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on these high volume lasik surgery practices 

table of contents we began selling the intralase fs laser and our per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface in the united states during the fourth quarter of  in asia during the third quarter of and in europe during the first quarter of as of december   we had an installed base of lasers in the united states and outside the united states 
in addition  we had sold over  per procedure disposable patient interfaces worldwide 
sales we sell our laser through our direct sales force in the united states and through our direct sales efforts and distributors internationally 
in the united states  we have six direct sales personnel  plus an executive managing our sales efforts 
the us sales force primarily consists of personnel with extensive experience in the sale of lasers and other products to refractive surgeons 
internationally  we sell through local country distributors and three sales consultants and an executive devoted to direct sales efforts and international distributor development 
we have approximately distributor contracts with distributors in the asia pacific region  europe and the middle east  and we also sell our product offering directly to customers in selected countries 
our sales team is supported by internal sales administration and a customer service team based in irvine  california 
we do not anticipate adding to our sales force substantially 
however  it is likely that we will continue to add international distributors as we expand into new countries 
each distributor contract typically gives the appointed distributor the exclusive right to promote  market  sell  service and support our intralase fs laser  intralasik software  per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface and the associated tool kit within a specified country or set of countries  for use in the field of ophthalmology surgical centers 
distributors are obligated to develop customer prospects  sell product and provide servicing and training relating to our product offering in their territory 
distributor contract terms are typically between one and three years 
however  there are termination rights for either party in the event the other party fails to perform any material obligations 
payments by the distributor to us are in us currency and generally are made cash in advance or by irrevocable letter of credit  however  in the second quarter of  we began selling to selected and qualified distributors on credit terms 
title to the equipment transfers upon shipment and there is no right of return of any product to us 
the distributor contracts provide a standard twelve month warranty for defective components  subject to customary exclusions 
all of the contracts contain standard provisions regarding our ownership of our intellectual property and the distributors obligations to maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property 
distributors are obligated to indemnify us for liabilities arising from the distributor s failure to perform its obligations under the distributor contract  or for its misconduct or negligence in handling the products 
under some of the contracts  we will indemnify the distributor for claims arising out of or relating to the manufacture  use and sale of our product offering or any infringement by us of the intellectual property of third parties with respect to our product offering 
marketing our marketing efforts involve two key strategies marketing to prospective customers 
we market our product offering to lasik surgery practices with a combination of printed and electronic media sales literature and educational seminars and training  the publication of clinical studies and articles in ophthalmic journals by surgeons who are users of our product offering  advertising in ophthalmology magazines and journals  and public speaking by surgeon customers at the major ophthalmology shows and conferences we attend 
we provide a consistent message about our product offering  and our better medicine and better business model 
complementing our surgeon customers marketing efforts 
lasik surgery practices generally obtain patients through direct advertising in their local markets or through referrals from the patients optometrists 
our marketing efforts are designed to complement these dual marketing strategies of our customers 
many large lasik surgery practices advertise directly to potential patients 
we complement and support our customers marketing strategies by providing public relations support  a strong branding  product and consumer brochures  educational cd roms  as well as literature and templates for radio and print advertising which our surgeon customers can use in their own advertising 
in addition  since many lasik surgeons rely on their potential patient s optometrists for referrals  we assist surgeons in strengthening their optometrist referral network by sponsoring continuing medical education seminars  soliciting key opinion leaders in optometry to make presentations and write articles on our technology  as well as sponsoring training wet labs in which optometrists are brought to the surgeon s center for education about our technology and an opportunity to use our technology to make a flap cut on a non live animal eye 

table of contents customer service and support our customer support strategy is to continue to offer extensive support to our customers to build a reputation as a premier service provider 
in the united states  we provide customer service through the following measures technical services 
our technical services personnel are responsible for our technical support hotline that handles customer calls hours a day  seven days a week 
these personnel also are responsible for phone support to customers and distributors  scheduling on site routine maintenance visits by our field service personnel and dispatching our personnel to the customer s site if necessary 
field services 
our field service engineers are responsible for laser site inspection  installation  training  on going routine maintenance and necessary repair 
clinical applications 
our clinical applications personnel are responsible for clinical training on the use of our intralase fs laser and per procedure disposable patient interface  telephone support and on site support to ensure successful clinical integration of our product offering at customer sites 
these personnel also provide free per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces on the first surgery day where the surgeon typically performs a majority of lasik surgeries with our technology 
we provide laser site inspection  installation and clinical training prior to the acceptance of our laser by our surgeon customers 
clinical training typically takes no more than one day  since most of our surgeon customers have already acquired some of the skills necessary for the operation of our laser based on prior experience using the excimer laser 
the surgeon is likely to become more proficient with our product offering as he or she gains additional experience  similar to other devices and surgical techniques 
in international markets  we provide customer service through our distributors 
our technical services  field service and clinical applications personnel each provide training and support to our distributors and their personnel  and our distributors in turn provide all customer services and support to the end user surgeons 
all international distributors are required to send at least one service engineer to our training facility in irvine  california  for an intensive training course on the installation  routine maintenance and repair of our laser and are required to send their engineer s for additional training provided by intralase at specified times 
we expect to establish training facilities in one or more select international locations in the near future 
as of december   we had field service  technical services and clinical applications personnel worldwide who are responsible for servicing customers in direct sales markets and supporting our distributors 
all of our direct customers who purchase or lease our laser receive a one year limited warranty and are required either to maintain a maintenance contract thereafter or to pay for service and preventive maintenance on a time and materials basis in order to use our laser and to receive on going maintenance and support 
international distributor agreements generally provide for a one year parts only warranty  with the distributor responsible for customer support to the end user surgeons 
the international distributor is responsible for obtaining a fee based maintenance agreement from their customer and servicing the equipment 
intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property 
we believe that in order to have a competitive advantage  we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies 
we require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment  consulting or advisory relationships with us 
we also require our employees  consultants and advisors who we expect to work on our product offering to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the work day  using our property  or which relate to our business 
despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our product offering or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
patents we have developed a patent portfolio that covers many aspects of our laser  laser beam guidance  other components of our laser  methods for inducing breakdown of corneal tissue and our per procedure disposable patient interface 
as of december   we own issued us patents and nine us pending patent applications  nine issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
our patents expire between and we have multiple patents covering unique aspects of our laser and per procedure disposable patient interface 

table of contents we have entered into three licenses for several key patents and patent applications relating to different aspects of our laser and our per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
as of december   we exclusively license  for human health  issued us patents  with expiration dates from through  and three us pending patent applications  foreign patents and nine foreign pending patent applications 
one of these licenses is for exclusive worldwide use of the intellectual property covered by such patents in the fields of lasers designed for human health applications and another is for exclusive worldwide use of the intellectual property covered by such patents in the fields of ultra fast lasers designed for human health applications 
under two of these licenses we pay periodic license maintenance fees 
in addition  we have entered into two non exclusive worldwide license agreements with third parties relating to patents that apply either to components of our laser or our disposable patient interface  as applicable 
we pay royalties on the sale or lease of our laser or the sale of our disposable patient interface  as applicable  under these license agreements and are also required to pay a minimum amount of royalties per year 
on july   we entered an agreement to acquire a fully paid royalty free irrevocable and worldwide license from the university of michigan for the use of certain technology and to settle all past contract disputes for aggregate consideration of  upon closing this agreement on july  we recorded a charge of  which is included within research and development expenses in  related to the settlement of the contract disputes and capitalized  which is included at its amortized value within total long term assets at december   associated with acquired licenses in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
on august   the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  granted a request for re examination with respect to us patent re  one of the four us patents licensed to us by the university of michigan  which means that the pto found that the request raised a new issue of patentability with regard to some of the claims 
re examination may result in the scope of protection and rights provided by the patent license being lost or narrowed 
the irrevocable license we acquired and the payment we made pursuant to the july  license agreement will not be affected by the granting of re examination  regardless of the outcome 
although we believe that the intellectual property covered by the patent subject to the re examination is important to our business  if this patent is invalidated there will be no effect on our ability to sell our products 
however  invalidation or narrowing of this patent might allow others to market competitive products that would otherwise have infringed the patent 
the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages or discontinue the manufacture and sale of our products 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
our success also will depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others  including our competitors and potential competitors 
if any key aspect of our product offering is found to infringe the patents of others  our development  manufacture and sale of our product offering could be severely restricted or prohibited 
in addition  third parties including our competitors may independently develop similar technologies 
because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business  we may lose market share to our potential competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights 
if an entrant with products or technology directly competitive to our products or technology should arise  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows 
while we make an effort to ensure that our product offering does not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights  our product offering and related methods may be covered by patents held by others 
in addition  third parties may assert that future products we may market infringe their patents 
further  a patent infringement suit brought against us may force us to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize such potential products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business

shui lai  we are obligated to indemnify mr 
lai against claims  losses and expenses arising out of the distribution of the products we manufacture using the licensed technology 
trademarks we own or have rights to material trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the sale of our product offering  which include  among others  intralase  intralase fs  intralasik and the new shape of vision 
generally  elements of our product offering are marketed under one of these trademarks or brand names 
manufacturing we have one manufacturing facility located in irvine  california where our intralase fs laser is assembled and tested and our intralasik software is designed  programmed and tested 
this facility is also where we assemble  in a semi automated process  the metal cone and glass lens for our disposable patient interface  the components of which are manufactured by outside vendors 
we then ship the disposable patient interface to a third party for sterilization and packaging 
at december   we had approximately employees in operations  regulatory and quality assurance 
we purchase all of the components used in the manufacture and assembly of our product offering from outside vendors 
these outside vendors produce the components we require  including the printed circuit boards and objective lens used in the laser and the metal cone  glass and packaging used for our disposable patient interface  to our specifications and in many instances to our design 
our quality assurance personnel audit our vendors for conformance to our specifications  policies and procedures and inspect and test the components or assemblies at various steps in the manufacturing and assembly cycle 
this process facilitates compliance with the regulatory requirements for the manufacturing and sale of our product offering 
a portion of components for our laser product are made by sole source vendors 
although these components constitute only a portion of the total components in our product offering  these components are integral to the success of our product offering and as a result our success is tied to our continuing ability to obtain supplies of these components 
we have never experienced any significant disruption in supply of any of our components 
we endeavor to manage the risk of single sources by maintaining inventories in excess of lead time requirements and by maintaining good vendor relationships 
in addition  we continuously seek to identify and qualify additional suppliers based on our volume requirements 
we purchase our product inventories through standard purchase orders and do not currently have supply agreements with our outside vendors 
in the event of any disruption in our vendor relationships  arrangements for additional or replacement suppliers for some of these parts may not be achieved quickly and our business could be harmed by such delays 
see risk factors risks related to our business we depend on certain single source suppliers and manufacturers for key components of our laser  and the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers  or their inability to supply us with an adequate supply of materials  could harm our business 
research and development we believe that research and development activities are essential to maintaining and enhancing our business 
we continuously improve our product by introducing product enhancements such as the khz laser introduced in mid  which doubled the speed of our laser and the anticipated second quarter introduction of our khz laser  which again doubles the speed 
we also sponsor clinical studies to validate our existing product offering are developing new therapeutic applications for our technology 
our research and development group consists of individuals with research  engineering  medical and regulatory affairs experience 
our research and development expenses  including regulatory and clinical study expenses  were approximately million in  million in and million in competition although we believe that our product offering has substantial advantages over existing and prospective corneal flap creation technologies  we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from medical device companies  as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies  both in the united states and abroad 
the principal elements of competition in the surgical vision correction market include safety  quality  functionality  better outcomes  support and service  the ability to develop new technologies and new therapeutic applications  as well as pricing 
we believe that overall we compete favorably with respect to the increased safety  precision and visual acuity achieved when using our laser technology and our extensive support structure 

table of contents the principal sources of this competition are as follows competition in creating the corneal flap microkeratome companies 
principal microkeratome manufacturers and suppliers with whom we compete include bausch lomb  with approximately of the us microkeratome and blade market  moria microtech  the second largest supplier of microkeratomes and blades in the us market  advanced medical optics and nidek 
we believe that these microkeratome manufacturers will continue to enhance and further develop microkeratomes to improve performance and accuracy to compete with our laser 
microkeratomes are less expensive than our laser  although surgeons typically need to purchase more than one microkeratome because the machine must be serviced at the manufacturer s location 
in addition  our competitors may offer microkeratome systems at a lower price  may price their microkeratome systems as part of a bundle of products or services  including the excimer laser used in the second step of lasik surgery  or may enhance or further develop products to improve performance and accuracy of their existing product to compete against us 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have 
competing femtosecond lasers 
we may also in the future compete with manufacturers of other femtosecond lasers to create the corneal flap 
several manufacturers have announced their intention to launch new femtosecond lasers that would compete directly with our products 
these include wavelight technologies  zeimer ophthalmic systems and perfect vision 
successful introduction of competing products by these or other manufacturers could reduce demand for our products  particularly if the competing products were perceived to offer superior capabilities or were marketed at a lower price 
however  even if these potential competitors are able to fully commercialize their products  they may not be able to successfully compete against our product offering 
other competing technologies 
since our product offering is used in the first step of lasik surgery  we also compete with other vision disorder treatments that compete with lasik  such as eyeglasses  contact lenses and other surgical products and techniques 
such techniques include prk and similar so called surface procedures  where no corneal flap is created prior to refractive treatment with the excimer laser 
surface procedures represent a small but growing portion of the laser vision correction market 
other techniques include intra ocular lenses and epithelial flaps  also known as epi lasik 
new intraocular lenses have been developed and recently approved for use in the us for correction of refractive error 
these lenses  termed phakic intraocular lenses are inserted into the anterior chamber or posterior chamber of the eye with the patient s crystalline lens left in place 
they are primarily used for correction of high refractive errors when corneal surgical procedures are contraindicated 
however  if used in patients that would otherwise be candidates for lasik  they could impact our market 
presbyopic intraocular lenses accommodative lenses and multifocal lenses have also been developed for correction of distance and near vision after cataract surgery 
although not approved for this use in the us  some surgeons are using these lenses to correct refractive error in patients that do not have a cataract 
this procedure is known as refractive lens exchange and involves removal of the patient s clear crystalline lens and implantation of the presbyopic intraocular lens 
patients with a refractive correction that do not have a cataract would normally fall within our market segment 
if the use of refractive lens exchange increases in popularity  this could impact our market 
corneal based refractive procedures which begin with removal of the epithelial layer of the corneal include prk  lasek and epi lasik 
an increase in any of these three procedures could impact the volume of the lasik market 
if any of these alternative treatments result in decreased demand for lasik surgery  this would decrease demand for our product offering 
government regulation our product offering is regulated as a medical device 
accordingly  our product design and development  testing  labeling  manufacturing  processes  promotional activities and sales are regulated extensively by government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we market and sell our product offering 
we have clearance from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to market our laser in the united states 
we also have the approvals necessary to sell our product offering in the european union and other international markets in which we currently sell our product offering 

table of contents united states in the united states  the fda regulates the design  manufacture  distribution  quality standards and marketing of medical devices 
fda regulation includes  among other things  post market surveillance and adverse event reporting requirements 
there are two principal methods by which fda regulated devices may be marketed in the united states k clearance and pre market approval  or pma 
to obtain k clearance  we must demonstrate that our product offering is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device or other appropriate predicate device 
a pma application is a longer and more complicated process  and is required for a device that does not qualify for k clearance 
we intend to utilize the k notification procedure whenever possible 
to date  all components of our product offering have qualified for k clearance  and have not required a pma application 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  will require a new k clearance  or could even require a pma application 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer s determination  the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing or recall the modified device until k clearance or a pma is obtained 
we received k clearance in december to market our intralase fs laser and our disposable patient interface in the united states 
in addition  we have received k clearances for the creation of channels for intracorneal ring segments for lamellar keratoplasty and for penetrating keratoplasty  all of which are used in therapeutic corneal procedures 
as we develop new products and applications or make significant modifications to our existing product offering  we will need to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to market such products for vision correction and other medical procedures in our target markets 
after the fda permits a device to enter commercial distribution  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
these include the registration and listing regulation  which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution  quality system regulation  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process  labeling regulations  the fda s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off label uses  medical device reporting regulation  which requires that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur  and reporting of corrections and removals of devices that are intended to reduce a risk to health 
we also are subject to unannounced inspections for our us facility by the fda and the food and drug branch of the california department of health services  and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors 
our laser is a radiation emitting product as well as a medical device 
therefore  we are also regulated by the fda under the radiation control for health and safety act 
this law is intended to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective and seeks to reduce unnecessary exposure to radiation from medical  occupational  and consumer products 
if we do not comply with the fda s regulatory requirements we may be subject to an fda enforcement action  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions and civil penalties  
table of contents recall or seizure of our product offering  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our request for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or pma approvals that are already granted  suspension in the issuance of export certificates  and criminal prosecution 
to date  we have not been subject to any material enforcement action by the fda 
international sales of our laser based product offering outside the united states are subject to the regulatory requirements of the foreign country or  if applicable  the harmonized standards of the european union 
these regulatory requirements vary widely among countries and may include technical approvals  such as electrical safety  as well as demonstration of clinical efficacy 
in europe  the member countries of the european union have promulgated rules that require medical products to receive the certifications necessary to affix the ce mark to the device 
the ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
certification under the iso standards for quality assurance and manufacturing processes is one of the ce mark requirements 
we are licensed to apply the ce mark to our product offering in accordance with the european medical device directives  which permits us to commercially distribute our lasers throughout the european union and to perform flap procedures and corneal transplant procedures using our product offering 
we rely on foreign regulatory approvals and export certifications from the fda to comply with certain regulatory requirements in several foreign jurisdictions  such as australia  canada  korea  taiwan and countries in western europe 
we intend to meet applicable foreign country regulatory requirements for our product offering 
other regulatory requirements we also are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under many other laws administered by us and foreign governmental agencies on the national  state and local levels  including requirements regarding occupational health and safety and the use  handling and disposing of toxic or hazardous substances 
product liability insurance we maintain product liability insurance with respect to our product offering with a general coverage limit of million in the aggregate 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  approximately two thirds of whom are located in our facilities in irvine  california  and with worldwide based sales  field service and clinical applications personnel located primarily outside of california 
we have sales and marketing employees  research  development and engineering employees  operations  regulatory and quality assurance employees technical services  field services and clinical applications employees and general and administrative employees 
none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have not experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees

item a risk factors risks related to our industry our success depends upon the continued acceptance of lasik surgery 
our business depends upon continued market acceptance of lasik surgery by both surgeons and patients in the united states and international markets 
lasik surgery has only been approved since and commercially available since and  to date  has penetrated approximately of the eligible us population 
we believe that if market acceptance of lasik surgery declines  demand for our product offering by lasik surgery practices and potential patients will decline  resulting in a decrease in our revenues 
some consumers may choose not to undergo lasik surgery due to concerns with the safety and efficacy of an elective surgery in general or the lasik procedure in particular  due to concerns about price or due to their belief that improved technology or alternative methods of treatment will be available in the near future 
lasik surgery itself can result in potential complications and side effects  such as post operative discomfort  unintended over or under corrections  disorders in corneal healing  undesirable visual sensations caused by bright lights such as glare or halos and dry eye 
should either the ophthalmic community or the general population turn away from lasik surgery as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders  or if future technologies replace lasik surgery  these developments would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents weak or uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our product offering 
because lasik surgery is not generally paid for through insurance programs or government reimbursement  patients typically pay for lasik surgery directly with their own discretionary funds 
accordingly  weak or uncertain economic conditions may cause individuals to be less willing to pay for lasik surgery  as was evidenced by the decline in lasik procedures in the united states in as compared to a decline in economic conditions in the united states or in international markets could result in a decline in demand for lasik surgery and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in us federal tax laws governing the ability of potential lasik patients to use pre tax dollars to pay for lasik surgery could adversely affect demand for our product offering 
we believe a significant number of us patients pay for lasik surgery with pre tax dollars pursuant to plans sponsored under section of the internal revenue code 
these plans are commonly referred to as cafeteria plans 
changes in the us tax laws or regulations governing cafeteria plans could reduce or eliminate the ability of patients to use pre tax dollars to pay for lasik surgery  resulting in an increase in the total cost borne by patients  which would likely reduce the volume of lasik surgeries  and thus demand for our per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our business we are subject to extensive government regulation  and a failure to comply may increase our costs and prevent us from selling our product offering 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  including inspections and controls over research and development  testing  manufacturing  safety and environmental controls  efficacy  labeling  advertising  promotion  pricing  record keeping and the sale and distribution of our product offering 
although we have obtained all necessary clearances from the food and drug administration  or fda  as well as all necessary foreign governmental approvals to market and sell our product offering  we must continue to comply with such regulations to continue to manufacture  market and sell our product offering 
noncompliance with fda requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  manufacturing suspensions  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts  suspension in the issuance of export certificates and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has authority to request repair  replacement or the refund of the cost of any product we manufacture or distribute 
regulatory authorities outside of the united states may impose similar sanctions for noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
if we are subject to any sanctions by the fda or a foreign regulatory agency  our costs may increase and we may be prevented from manufacturing or selling our product offering  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
lasik surgeons must continue to adopt our product offering as an attractive alternative to the microkeratome for creating the corneal flap 
in the three months ended december   we believe we captured approximately of the us market for creating the corneal flap 
we believe that lasik surgeons may not continue to adopt our product offering unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and studies and published journal articles  including peer review articles  that our product offering provides significant benefits or an attractive alternative over the traditional method of creating the corneal flap using the microkeratome 
a small number of surgeons have informed us  based on their experiences  of the following issues with our product offering when compared to the traditional microkeratome approach surgeons may need to perform multiple procedures with our product offering to become skilled with our laser and related techniques  and the overall procedure to prepare the patient and create the corneal flap with our laser may take slightly longer per patient 
lasik surgeons also must determine that the advantages and benefits of our product offering outweigh the increased costs associated with switching to our technology from the microkeratome 
the microkeratome device costs between  and  per device  and  because the devices must be cleaned after each patient use and must be returned to the manufacturer for any service  lasik surgeons typically purchase multiple devices to ensure a device is available for each surgery being performed 
in comparison  our laser costs approximately  additionally  using the microkeratome results in a cost between and per procedure to purchase the disposable blades  while our per procedure fee inclusive 
table of contents of a disposable patient interface costs new lasik surgeons approximately per procedure 
the additional costs associated with our product offering could hinder continued adoption of our technology by lasik surgeons  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we believe that recommendations and support of our laser by influential lasik surgeons are essential for its market acceptance and adoption 
if we do not receive support from such surgeons or from the data and experience of users  it may become difficult to have additional lasik surgeons adopt our product offering 
in such circumstances  we may not achieve expected revenues or profits 
presently unknown side effects related to the use of our laser could emerge in the future 
use of the intralase fs laser to create the lasik flap is a relatively new technique 
consequently there is no long term follow up data beyond five years that might reveal unknown side effects or complications associated specifically with this technique 
the possibility of unfavorable side effects  and any concomitant adverse publicity  could seriously harm our business 
in addition to the potential side effects and complications associated with lasik generally  some lasik surgeons have observed incidents of transient light sensitivity in patients treated with our system  although this has affected only a small percentage of patients and appears to resolve quickly with treatment 
any future reported adverse outcomes or pattern of side effects involving the use of our laser specifically  or with respect to lasik procedures generally  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
patients must continue to be willing to pay for lasik surgery using our product offering despite it being more expensive than lasik surgery with the microkeratome 
lasik surgeons typically receive an average of more per eye when using our product offering instead of the traditional microkeratome 
to date  lasik surgeons have been able to improve the rate at which laser vision correction consultations translate into actual surgery from approximately to when using our product offering instead of the traditional microkeratome  according to an independent survey of our customers conducted in early this indicates that patients have been willing to pay for lasik surgery using our product offering despite its higher cost 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
to date  we have competed primarily with manufacturers of the microkeratome  the traditional method used to create the corneal flap as the first step in lasik surgery 
principal manufacturers of the microkeratome include bausch lomb  with approximately percent of the us microkeratome and blade market  moria microtech  the second largest supplier of microkeratomes and blades in the us market  advanced medical optics and nidek 
microkeratomes are less expensive to manufacture than our laser and our competitors may offer microkeratome systems at a lower price as part of a bundle of products or services  including the excimer laser used in the second step of lasik surgery 
further  we expect that our competitors will continue to release new or enhanced microkeratome models which may offer improved performance over earlier generation products 
any of these actions could decrease demand for our product offering  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of these competitors  particularly bausch lomb  have substantially greater resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have 
we may also in the future compete with manufacturers of alternative technologies to create the corneal flap 
in addition  several manufacturers have announced their intention to launch new femtosecond lasers that would compete directly with our products 
these include wavelight technologies  zeimer ophthalmic systems  which has displayed its system  and perfect vision  which we believe has commercially sold at least one system internationally 
successful introduction of competing products by these or other manufacturers could reduce demand for our products  particularly if the competing products were perceived to offer superior capabilities or were marketed at a lower price 
if alternative technologies gain market acceptance  this may also reduce demand for our product offering 
since our product offering is used in the first step of lasik surgery  we also compete with other vision disorder treatments that compete with lasik  such as eyeglasses  contact lenses and other surgical products and techniques 
such techniques include intra ocular lenses  corneal inlays and epithelial flaps  also known as epi lasik 
if any of these alternative treatments result in decreased demand for lasik surgery  this would decrease demand for our product offering 
in addition  medical companies  academic and research institutions and others could develop new therapies  medical devices or surgical procedures that could potentially render lasik surgery obsolete 
any such developments would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the medical device and ophthalmic laser industries are subject to rapid and significant technological change  frequent new device introductions and evolving surgical techniques 
demand for our product offering may decline if a new or alternative product or technology is introduced by one of our competitors that represents a substantial improvement over our existing product offering  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
measures we take to ensure collection of per procedure charges may be inadequate 
generating per procedure revenues from our installed base of lasers is a key aspect of our business 
we charge our customers a per procedure fee for each eye treated 
this fee is inclusive of a disposable patient interface  which is intended to be used on a single eye and discarded 
we typically charge our customers procedure fees based on our shipments to them of per procedure disposable interfaces 
we believe that a small percentage of our customers  in an effort to avoid procedure fees  are using a single patient interface to treat multiple eyes 
if this practice or other fee avoidance practices were to proliferate  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our proprietary intralasik software contains a feature which requires the laser to periodically be reprogrammed in order to perform additional procedures 
we have introduced technology which allows us to do this remotely using secure activation techniques 
approximately percent of intralase lasers have been upgraded to new software versions that require either remote electronic activation when the customers order procedures or an intralase generated activation code used by the customers at their sites 
secure activation capabilities allow us to align the number of procedures available on the laser with the number of patient interfaces purchased to prevent reuse 
however  if these capabilities prove inadequate  or if other fee avoidance methods are devised which we are unable to detect or counter  or if we are unable to enhance the majority of lasers in our worldwide installed base  this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
by way of example  circumstances that could potentially hamper our enforcement efforts include theft or disclosure of confidential passwords  improper or unauthorized tampering with laser hardware or software  lack of cooperation from international distributors  inability to obtain access to lasers in the field  legal impediments imposed by foreign jurisdictions and or counterfeit patient interfaces 
product liability suits brought against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates 
if our intralase fs laser or our per procedure disposable patient interface is defectively designed or manufactured or contains defective components  our intralasik software is defective  any component of our product offering is misused or if a customer fails to adhere to operating guidelines  or if someone claims any of the foregoing  whether or not such claims are meritorious  we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation 
any product liability claims brought against us  with or without merit  could divert management s attention from our business  be expensive to defend  result in sizable damage awards against us  damage our reputation  increase our product liability insurance rates  prevent us from securing continuing coverage  or prevent or interfere with commercialization efforts for our product offering  any of which occurrences would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims 
product liability claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage would likely be paid out of cash reserves  harming our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we make field corrections to our laser that are typically made by our field service representatives during scheduled service calls but which may sometimes be made using remote diagnostics 
although these field corrections have not had a financial impact on us to date  any future corrections or recalls  especially any that result in preventing use of our laser or customers returning the laser to us for repair  would have a material adverse effect on us 
our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our intellectual property rights  which could substantially impair our ability to compete 
our success and ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law and license agreements  as well as nondisclosure agreements  to protect our intellectual property 
these legal means  however  afford only limited protection and may not be adequate to protect our rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will issue 
the us patent and trademark office  or pto  may deny or significantly narrow claims made under our patent applications and  even if issued  these patents may be challenged or may otherwise not provide us with commercial 
table of contents protection 
on august   the pto granted a request for re examination with respect to us patent re  one of the patents licensed to us by the university of michigan  which means that the pto found that the request raised a new issue of patentability with regard to a number of claims 
re examination may result in the scope of protection and rights provided by the patent license being lost or narrowed 
we may in the future need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property 
regardless of the final outcome  any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents  copyrights  or trademarks could be highly unpredictable and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of an adverse judgment  a court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed  or are invalid or unenforceable  and could award attorneys fees to the other party 
in addition  the laws of other countries in which our product offering is or may be sold may not protect our product offering and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  if at all 
we also may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights  we may not be successful in doing so  or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products  technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our patented or proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights  which could substantially impair our ability to compete 
we may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others  which could prohibit us from selling our product offering  require us to obtain licenses from third parties  require us to develop non infringing alternatives and or subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief 
third parties could assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current or future product offerings  whether or not such claims are valid 
we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of such third parties or others 
any infringement or misappropriation claim could result in significant costs  substantial damages and our inability to manufacture  market or sell our existing or future product offerings that are found to infringe 
if a court determined  or if we independently discovered  that our product offering violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to re engineer our product offering to avoid those rights or obtain a license under those rights on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
as a result  we could be prohibited from selling products that are found to infringe 
even if obtaining a license were feasible  it may be costly and time consuming 
a court also could enter orders that temporarily  preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and or our customers from making  using  selling  offering to sell or importing our product offering  or could enter orders mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities 
a court also could order us to pay compensatory damages for such infringement  plus prejudgment interest  and could in addition treble the compensatory damages and award attorneys fees 
these damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been involved in litigation with escalon medical corp 
concerning a license agreement with escalon under which we license certain intellectual property 
the litigation arose as a result of escalon s attempt to terminate the license agreement based on alleged underpayment of royalties see part i  item  legal proceedings 
we believe that escalon will persist in its attempts to terminate the license agreement  and intend to defend against such efforts vigorously 
termination of the escalon license agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on certain single source suppliers and manufacturers for key components of our laser  and the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers  or their inability to supply us with an adequate supply of materials  could harm our business 
we rely upon certain suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply key parts for our laser on a sole or limited source basis 
our arrangements with these key suppliers and manufacturers are not on a contractual basis and can be terminated by either party without advance notice 
if any of these suppliers and manufacturers were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or cease providing us these key components  we would be required to locate and contract with substitute suppliers 
we could have difficulty identifying a substitute supplier in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms 
if this were to occur  we may not be able to meet our sales goals or continue manufacturing lasers  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to manage our rapid growth may strain the capabilities of our managers  operations and facilities 
we are growing rapidly 
in we sold or leased lasers and sold approximately  per procedures fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
in we sold or leased lasers and sold approximately  per 
table of contents procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface  and in  we sold or leased lasers and sold approximately  per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
this growth has resulted in  and continued growth will create in the future  additional capacity requirements  new and increased responsibilities for our management team and may create pressures on our operating and financial systems 
our expected growth will require us to hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel sufficiently in advance to be in a position to meet the requirements of such growth 
continued growth will also require us to improve existing  and implement new operating  financial and management information controls  reporting systems and procedures  and effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties 
in addition  our anticipated growth may strain the ability of our suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of components in accordance with agreed upon specifications on a timely basis 
additional growth may also prevent us from being able to respond to new opportunities and challenges quickly 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expected growth  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we plan to expand further into markets outside the united states  which subjects us to additional business and regulatory risks 
our international sales commenced in and represented of our total revenues and of our total revenues in we intend to derive an increasing portion of our total revenues from sales of our product offering in foreign countries 
we plan to focus most of our efforts on the asia pacific region  europe  south america and the middle east 
conducting business internationally subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to being subject to political and economic instability in foreign markets  we require export licenses and are subject to tariffs and other trade barriers and overlapping tax structures 
in addition  we must comply with foreign regulatory requirements 
in creating and building our infrastructure internationally  we must also educate lasik surgeons and optometrists about our product offering and attract and maintain relationships with third party distributors 
if we are unable to do any of this successfully  we may not be able to grow our international presence  and this could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success is tied to a single product offering 
we have a single product offering used primarily in lasik surgery 
as a result  our success is tied to the success of this product offering since we are not currently able to derive revenues from alternate product offerings 
if for any reason we are unable to continue to manufacture or sell our product offering or if production of our product offering were interrupted or could not continue in a cost effective or timely manner  whether due to regulatory sanctions  manufacturing constraints  product defects or recalls  obsolescence of our technology  increased competition  intellectual property concerns or otherwise  our business would be materially harmed 
all of our operations are conducted at a single location 
any disruption at our existing or at a new facility could increase our expenses 
all of our operations are currently and will continue to be conducted at a single location 
we take precautions to safeguard our existing facility  including insurance  health and safety protocols and off site storage of computer data 
however  a natural disaster  such as an earthquake or fire could cause substantial delays in our operations  damage or destroy our manufacturing equipment or inventory  and cause us to incur additional expenses 
the insurance we maintain against fires and other natural disasters and the property and business interruption insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
a loss of key executives or failure to attract qualified personnel could limit our growth and adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of key personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our employees other than with our chief executive officer  our executive vice president  chief operating officer  our senior vice president and general counsel  and our vice president  human resources  and we do not have key person insurance on any of our executives 
the loss of any one or more key managers could place a significant strain on our remaining management team and we may have difficulty replacing any of these individuals 
furthermore  our future growth will depend in part upon our ability to identify  hire and retain additional key personnel  including qualified management  research and other highly skilled technical personnel 

table of contents our new products or applications may not be commercially viable 
while we devote significant resources to research and development  our research and development may not lead to improved or new products or applications that are commercially successful 
the research and development process is expensive  prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty 
development of medical devices  from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch  typically takes between three and seven years 
each of these periods varies considerably from product to product and country to country 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development  products and applications we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products or applications successfully 
the products and applications currently in our development pipeline may not be approved by regulatory entities and may not be commercially successful  and our current and planned products and applications could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products and applications developed and marketed by others 
if we choose to acquire new or complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete those acquisitions or to successfully integrate them in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
while we have not made any acquisitions in the past and do not have current commitments to do so  we may in the future choose to acquire businesses  products or technologies to retain our competitive position within the marketplace or to expand into new markets 
we cannot assure you  however  that we would be able to successfully complete any acquisition we choose to pursue  or that we would be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  product or technology in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
if we were unable to integrate any acquired businesses  products or technologies effectively  our business would likely suffer 
we have a history of net losses and may not maintain profitability 
although we were profitable in  we have incurred significant operating losses in each previous full year since our inception in we incurred net losses applicable to common stockholders of million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in order to maintain profitability  we will need to continue to increase our revenues from sales of our product offering  and we will also need to continue to derive an increasing percentage of our total revenues from sales of our per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface  which generate a higher gross margin than sales and leases of our intralase fs laser 
even if we do maintain profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis due to  among other things  competitive pressures and regulatory compliance  in which case the price of our common stock may decline 
changes to our accounting for stock options will adversely affect our earnings and may adversely affect stock price 
we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if an employee s stock option exercise price equals or exceeds the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
however  in december the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised that will require us to expense the fair value of stock options granted 
if we were to change our accounting policy in accordance with the existing sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and retroactively restate all prior periods as if we had adopted sfas for all periods presented  our income from operations would have decreased by approximately million in and our loss from operations would have increased by approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
revised requires that the estimated fair value from all stock based compensation transactions be recognized in our financial statements in we believe the adoption of sfas no 
revised will result in total stock based compensation of approximately million  the majority of which will arise from the implementation of sfas revised  as compared to million of stock based compensation recognized in however  actual results may vary depending upon stock option grants and stock compensation programs 
we may incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules proposed by the securities and exchange commission and by the nasdaq stock market  have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in increased costs to us as a public company 

table of contents the new rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officers liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
additionally  unearned deferred stock compensation for non employees is periodically remeasured through the vesting date under current and future accounting rules 
this periodic remeasurement could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
item b unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we lease  square feet of office and manufacturing space for our corporate  research and development and manufacturing headquarters in irvine  california  under a lease for a period of ten years and four months that began may  we believe the new facility will be adequate to meet our current requirements 
item legal proceedings on june   we received notice from escalon medical corp 
of its intent to terminate our license agreement unless we paid additional royalties and expenses which escalon claimed were owed under its interpretation of the parties license agreement 
escalon sought payment of approximately  through march  and additional unspecified amounts for future periods 
we disputed escalon s contract interpretation 
on june   we filed a complaint against escalon for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court for the central district of california to clarify our obligations and prevent escalon from terminating the license agreement the first california action 
on march   the court in the first california action entered a summary judgment order  ruling on the majority of issues in the case 
the court ruled in our favor on some issues and in escalon s favor on others 
on april  escalon again attempted to terminate the license agreement 
on april  the court found the purported termination to be ineffective 
on may   the court entered a final judgment in the first california action  in effect adopting its prior summary judgment rulings 
this ended the first california action 
of the approximately  demanded by escalon through march   approximately  was found to be due under the court s rulings in the first california action 
we have timely paid this amount 
we do not believe that the judgment in the first california action will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the decision in the first california action  if upheld  represents an increase in royalties payable to escalon of approximately of revenues  and a concomitant reduction in gross margins and operating profits 
these effects are reflected in our reported financial results for we have appealed certain aspects of the court s judgment in the first california action to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
the first california action did not resolve all of the parties disputes  and escalon continued to contend in written notices to us that our royalty payments were inadequate 
on may   we commenced a new lawsuit against escalon in the united states district court for the central district of california to clarify the open issues the second california action 
one week later  escalon commenced a new lawsuit against us in the delaware chancery court  alleging  among other things  breach of the license agreement and breach of fiduciary duty the delaware action 
escalon moved to dismiss the second california action  and we moved to dismiss or stay the later filed delaware action 
on january   the second california action was dismissed without prejudice 
in its decision  the court explained that it was exercising its discretion to abstain from hearing the case because of the pending ninth circuit appeal  as well as the similar issues presented in the delaware action 
by prior agreement of the parties  this triggered the briefing schedule on our motion to dismiss or stay the delaware action  and on january  we filed our opening brief in support of the motion 
on february   escalon filed an amended complaint in the delaware action in lieu of responding to our opening brief 
on the same day  it sent a new default notice to us  alleging breach of the license agreement see below 
one of the issues now in dispute is valuation of our accounts receivable for royalty calculation purposes 
the court in the first california action found that creation of an account receivable on our books constituted non cash other property received  but expressly left open the value of such property for royalty calculation purposes 
on april   escalon  purporting to act in its capacity as a company shareholder  sent us an inspection demand under section of the delaware 
table of contents corporation law the first demand  seeking  among other things  detailed records concerning our accounts receivable 
we rejected escalon s first section demand as having an improper purpose under delaware law 
on july   escalon holdings  inc  apparently a wholly owned subsidiary of escalon  also purporting to act as a company shareholder  sent us a new section demand the second demand with language copied verbatim from the first demand 
we rejected the second demand on the same basis as the first 
under delaware law  a shareholder may bring an action to enforce a section demand if its statutory demand upon the corporation has been rejected 
on september   escalon and escalon holdings  inc commenced an action against us in the delaware chancery court under section of the delaware corporation law the action 
in the action  escalon seeks to inspect our records described in the section demands 
the crux of escalon s position appears to be that the amount of royalties which escalon receives under its contract with us is less than what it believes it would receive if receivables were valued under the contract the same way they are valued on our financial statements  and that therefore we are purportedly overstating the value of receivables on our financial statements to the detriment of shareholders 
the question of the proper valuation of receivables under the contract is already the subject of pending litigation between us and escalon 
we do not believe that a disruptive inspection of our proprietary business records would have a bearing on the resolution of this contract dispute 
we contend that the action is an escalon litigation tactic intended to benefit escalon in its capacity as a litigant by allowing it to circumvent existing contractual limitations on its inspection rights 
we believe this is an improper basis for a demand under section of the delaware corporation statute  and are defending against the action vigorously 
on february   we received a written notice from escalon asserting that we were in default under the license agreement by reason of alleged improper valuation of accounts receivable in our royalty payments as well as our alleged refusal to permit escalon to audit our books and records the default notice 
the default notice threatened termination of the license agreement if the accounts receivable deductions taken against royalty payments for each of the first three quarters of were not paid within fifteen days of the date of the letter 
the default notice also threatened termination if escalon was not satisfied with respect to the resolution of its audit rights within sixty days of the date of the letter 
on february   the parties agreed to submit their disputes to mediation  in delaware  under court of chancery rule  and to stay all litigation pending the outcome of the mediation 
in addition  escalon has agreed that its termination notice is suspended pending the outcome of the mediation and that  should the mediation be unsuccessful  we will be afforded the full fifteen and sixty day response periods set forth in the notice  which periods would commence one day after the mediation is declared unsuccessful 
we have also agreed that the time period for responding to escalon s amended complaint in the delaware action will be tolled on the same basis 
if we are unable to successfully mediate our disputes  we believe escalon will persist in attempting to terminate the license agreement 
termination of the escalon license agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on may   ari weitzner md  md  a brooklyn ophthalmologist  commenced a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york  purportedly as a class action  alleging that we violated the telephone consumer protection act tcpa by sending unsolicited fax advertisements in violation of the tcpa 
the complaint seeks statutory damages  costs and attorneys fees 
the tcpa provides for statutory damages of per violation  if knowing and willful 
we intend to contest the weitzner action vigorously 
on august   the united states patent and trademark office pto granted a request for re examination with respect to us patent re  one of the four us patents licensed to us by the university of michigan  which means that the pto found that the request raised a new issue of patentability with regard to some of the claims 
re examination may result in the scope of protection and rights provided by the patent license being lost or narrowed 
the irrevocable license we acquired and the payment we made pursuant to the july  license agreement will not be affected by the granting of re examination  regardless of the outcome 
although we believe that the intellectual property covered by the patent subject to the re examination is important to our business  if this patent is invalidated there will be no effect on our ability to sell our products 
however  invalidation or narrowing of this patent might allow others to market competitive products that would otherwise have infringed the patent 
we are also currently involved in other litigation incidental to our business 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolution of such litigation will not likely have a significant effect on our financial statements

overview background we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and marketing of an ultra fast laser  related software and disposable devices for use in lasik surgery 
our product offering is used primarily to create the corneal flap in the first step of lasik surgery 
intralase lasers are also used in surgical approaches to the treatment of diseased corneas  and we continue to explore other potential ophthalmic applications 
from our incorporation in late through late  we devoted substantially all of our resources to designing  developing  commercializing and marketing our intralase fs laser  our intralasik software and our disposable patient interface 
in late  we introduced our product offering to the us market  and we began expanding into key international markets in the second half of in the three months ended december   we captured approximately of the us market for lasik corneal flap creation 

table of contents our quarterly laser sales or leases  cumulative lasers installed and approximate per procedure patient interface units in  and were as follows q q q q q q q q q q q q laser sales leases per quarter cumulative lasers installed total per procedure fees  inclusive of disposable patient interface  sold installed base does not represent cumulative sales since an existing customer bought two new lasers in the first quarter of to retire original purchases 
we were profitable in with net income of million 
we incurred net losses applicable to common stockholders of approximately million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
revenues we generate revenues primarily from the sale or lease of our intralase fs laser and the sale of our per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
we derive a smaller portion of our revenues from product maintenance 
the following table sets forth the sources and amounts of our revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  units revenue units revenue units revenue intralase fs laser per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface product maintenance total revenues we target the most active lasik surgery practices in the united states and in key international markets to adopt our product offering in order to generate recurring business from our per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
we expect that  even with increased sales and leases of our intralase fs laser  repeat revenues from the higher gross margin per procedure fees will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues  which will  in turn  drive higher overall gross margin 
terms of sale and revenue recognition laser terms of sale 
in the united states  we primarily sell our lasers to lasik surgery practices 
we also selectively enter into operating or sales type leases 
leases have terms of up to four years  commencing on installation and acceptance 
our terms of sale are typically on the basis of cash in advance  paid directly by our customers or on terms  typically net days from acceptance  to fiscally sound third party financing companies  institutions or well established corporate customers  or under sales type leases over the term of the agreement 
no customer accounted for more than of revenue in  or in  approximately of our new domestic laser unit placements were sales or sales type leases  representing of our total domestic laser revenues  and approximately were operating leases  representing of our total 
table of contents domestic laser revenues 
in comparison  in  of our new domestic laser unit placements were sales  representing of our total domestic laser revenues  and were operating leases  representing of our total domestic laser revenues 
outside the united states  we primarily sell to our international distributors and  in selected countries  directly to lasik surgery practices 
historically  payment terms have been cash in advance or irrevocable letters of credit  however  in the second quarter of we began selling to selected and qualified distributors on credit terms 
revenue recognition 
for the lasers we sell directly  we recognize revenue when the equipment has been delivered  installed and accepted at the customer location 
revenues from our leased lasers are classified as either operating leases or sales type leases as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
revenues from lasers under operating leases are recognized as earned over the lease term  commencing immediately after the laser is installed and accepted by the customer 
under sales type lease agreements  laser revenues are recognized based on the net present value of the expected cash flow after installation 
for laser sales to a distributor  revenues are recognized when the laser is shipped and title has transferred to the distributor 
for laser sales in the second quarter of that were sold prior to the availability of our kilohertz khz upgrade  the fair value of the upgrade was deferred and revenue was subsequently recognized when the upgrade had been delivered  installed and accepted at the customer location 
the khz upgrade is not required for laser functionality but does increase the speed of the procedure 
per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface terms of sale 
our customers order per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface directly from us as needed 
in the united states  payment is typically due days after shipment and the per procedure fee inclusive of a disposable patient interface is non refundable 
a small percentage of our us customers have agreed to a minimum monthly purchase requirement for per procedure fees 
international customers  primarily distributors  have typically paid for their per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface with cash in advance or by irrevocable letter of credit  however  in the second quarter of  we began selling to selected and qualified distributors on credit terms 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of our per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface is recognized upon shipment  and when title has passed in accordance with the sales terms 
we do not allow customers to return product 
product maintenance terms of sale 
our product offering includes maintenance 
we provide product maintenance when we sell directly or lease to customers and our international distributors provide maintenance for their territory sales outside the united states 
where we provide maintenance  maintenance agreements are renewable annually and are required at all times for the continued use of our laser and to receive on going maintenance and support 
when we receive prepaid maintenance funds we amortize the deferred maintenance amounts over the maintenance period 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance period 
international revenue expansion we introduced our product offering in the united states in late and internationally in the second half of as of december   we had sold or leased lasers in the united states and we had sold internationally  primarily in the asia pacific region and europe 
in international markets  we mainly sell our product offering through local country third party distributors 
these distributors are responsible for sales  customer support and product maintenance  and as a result generally pay a lower price for our product offering 
as a result  the mix between direct sales in the united states and distributor sales internationally may create fluctuations in our revenues and gross margin 
seasonality lasers 
sales and leases of our lasers are seasonal 
the second and fourth calendar quarters are typically stronger than the first and third calendar quarters 
two of the largest ophthalmology shows for refractive surgeons  the american society of cataract and refractive surgery  or ascrs  and the american academy of ophthalmology  or aao  are generally held in the second and fourth quarters  leading prospective customers to delay purchases in the first and third quarters until they 
table of contents have an opportunity to attend the shows  visit with us and attend lectures and symposiums on our product offering 
in addition  tax incentives typically help to drive us capital equipment spending higher in the fourth quarter 
sales and leases of our lasers in the third quarter are generally slower as surgeons in the united states and internationally typically take increased vacation time during the summer 
per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface 
sales of our per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface are also seasonal 
the first quarter typically shows an increase in volume in the united states 
we believe this is because many potential lasik patients in the united states access annual funding accounts established under internal revenue code section pre tax medical savings plans  or cafeteria plans  to purchase lasik surgery  as lasik surgery is not generally paid for through insurance programs or government reimbursement 
the second quarter typically is lower than the seasonally highest first quarter

results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated

during  we sold or leased lasers and generated million in revenues 
additionally  our khz upgrades resulted in the sale of upgrades and generated million in revenues  for total laser revenues of million 
in comparison   we sold or leased lasers and generated million in revenues 
the average selling price per laser sold or leased in decreased as compared to primarily because us operating leased units  which generate revenue typically over months  increased to of all us placements in the as compared to of all us placements in in  we sold approximately  per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface and generated million in revenues 
in comparison  during  we sold approximately  per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface and generated million in revenues 
we attribute the increase in sales of per procedure fees to an increased installed base of lasers  as we entered with approximately twice the installed base of lasers as compared to the same period in we expect sales of our per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface to continue to increase as the installed base of lasers increases 
the increase in our installed base of lasers in the us also led to an increase in our maintenance revenues to million in  as compared to million in we expect our maintenance revenues to continue to increase as the installed base of lasers in the us increases 

table of contents gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in costs of goods sold  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased primarily due to our per procedure fees inclusive of a patient interface  which generate higher margins  increasing to of total revenues in from of total revenues in in addition  larger production runs and improvements in our manufacturing processes have contributed to cost savings for our laser and patient interface 
we expect gross margins to continue to improve as the percentage of total revenues derived from per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface continues to increase 
revenues derived from per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface in are expected to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs of product research  product development  engineering  regulatory compliance and clinical support studies 
research and development expenses decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from one time expenses incurred in of  related to a technology license from the university of michigan and  of expenses associated with their related sale of stock in our initial public offering in in addition  decreased stock based compensation expense of  decreased clinical study and outside service expense of  and decreased legal expense of  offset a million increase in personnel costs 
the decrease in stock based compensation resulted primarily from lower stock based compensation associated with options granted to non employees subject to remeasurement variable plan accounting treatment 
although we expect research and development expenses to continue to decline as a percentage of our revenues we expect that the dollar amount of our research and development expenses will continue to increase in future years as we continue to develop  enhance and commercialize new and existing products  product enhancements and applications 
we also expect to incur increased expenses relating to regulatory compliance associated with new and existing applications and products and for regulatory approval for expansion of our existing product offering into new markets outside of the united states 
we also expect to incur increased expenses as we continue to support clinical studies 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with sales  marketing  field service and clinical applications that are not otherwise direct costs of installing and supporting our product offering  finance  information technology and human resources 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase resulted from higher personnel costs in sales  marketing and general and administrative departments of million  higher outside services  which primarily include consulting and legal fees  of million  higher marketing  advertising  promotion and event costs of million  an increase in commissions paid to sales representatives on higher sales totaling  and an increase in facilities and depreciation expense of million  offset by decreased stock based compensation of million 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses  which are primarily driven by sales and marketing expenses  to increase in the future as a result of continued growth in our sales and support infrastructure to support projected growth in revenues 
in addition  we expect the increased costs of being a public company to continue in the future 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net consists primarily of interest earned on investments in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities offset by interest expense 
interest and other income expense  net increased by million to million of income in from  in due to the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of and the resulting increase in interest income from the investment 
provision for income taxes in  we recorded a percent tax provision in the amount of  our effective tax rate of percent is primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents stock based compensation over the next several years  we will incur non cash expenses for employee stock based compensation  decreasing quarterly  for stock based compensation for stock options determined to have been issued with exercise prices less than estimated fair value 
in addition  we expect to incur stock based compensation expenses  primarily for options granted to non employees  that may decrease or increase quarterly  depending upon future fluctuations in our stock price 
in december  fasb issued sfas no revised sfas r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning in first quarter of fiscal management expects that we will use the modified prospective application method 
under sfas r  unearned deferred stock compensation for non employees will continue to be periodically remeasured through the vesting date 
this periodic remeasurement could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
see critical accounting policies stock based compensation 
management estimates that stock based compensation expense in will be million  the majority of which will arise from the adoption of sfas r  as compared to approximately million of stock based compensation expense recognized in however  actual results may vary depending upon stock option grants and stock compensation programs 
on december   intralase s board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all unvested and out of the money stock options with an exercise price per share of or higher 
the accelerated vesting caused options previously awarded for the purchase of approximately  shares of intralase common stock  representing approximately of total options outstanding  to vest and become exercisable immediately  subject to continued restrictions on sale 
of the  options subject to accelerated vesting  approximately  are held by directors and executive officers 
under apb no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a compensation charge because the exercise prices of the affected options was greater than the closing price of our common stock on december  the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was made primarily to reduce non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in intralase s income statement in future periods upon the adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment beginning in january as a result of this acceleration  we expect to reduce the stock option expense we would otherwise be required to record by approximately million  which is included in the pro forma calculation of net income under sfas no 
included in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately million of the million would have related to the board of directors believes the accelerated vesting of these options to be in the best interest of our shareholders and employees 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to continued market acceptance of our product offering and our further expansion into international markets  primarily in the asia pacific region  europe and the middle east  with the european increase due primarily to obtaining our ce mark in the first quarter of during  we sold or leased lasers and generated million in revenues 
in comparison  during  we sold or leased lasers and generated million in revenues 
in  of our total new laser sales or leases were sales  representing of our total laser revenues  and were operating leases  representing of our total laser revenues 
in comparison  in  the first year in which we began leasing lasers on a direct basis  of our total new unit placements were sales  representing of our total laser revenues  and were operating leases  representing of our total revenues 
the average selling price per laser sold or leased in increased percent as compared to primarily because we had fewer leases  which generate revenue over months  in as compared to the average selling price per laser excludes the deferral of the fair value of the maintenance agreement from laser revenue  which is amortized over the twelve month warranty period as maintenance revenue  and is also effected by the mix of international distributor sales and domestic sales and the mix of laser leases versus laser sales in the us in  we sold  per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces and generated million in revenues 
in comparison  during  we sold  per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces and generated million in revenues 
we attribute the increase in sales of per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces to an increased installed base of lasers  as we entered with approximately times the installed base of lasers as compared to the same period in we expect sales of our per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces to continue to increase as the installed base of lasers increases 

table of contents the increase in our installed base of lasers also led to an increase in our maintenance revenues to million during  as compared to million during we expect our maintenance revenues to continue to increase as the installed base of lasers increases 
gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in costs of goods sold  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased due to higher average selling prices for our laser  lower royalty expenses on our laser due to lower amortization costs for our licensing fees as compared to the royalties previously paid to the university of michigan  lower material costs and lower per unit labor and overhead costs for both our laser and our patient interface in as compared to the prior year period 
per unit material  labor and overhead costs were lower as the increase in the number of lasers sold or leased and the increase in the number of per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces sold resulted in volume discounts for material components and lower fixed overhead costs per unit 
additionally  changes in our laser product reduced vendor material costs 
research and development research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in this increase resulted from increased expenses for stock based compensation of million  a  expensed portion of converting a royalty agreement to a full paid royalty free technology license from the university of michigan   of higher personnel costs   to reimburse the selling stockholders for discounts and commissions to underwriters payable by the selling stockholders   in increased depreciation expense on higher fixed assets  increased legal fees associated with our intellectual property and licensing agreements of  increased expenses of  for regulatory and quality costs incurred in connection with obtaining our iso en certification and ce mark in the first quarter of selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase resulted from higher personnel costs in sales  marketing and general and administrative departments of million  an increase in stock based compensation of million  an increase in travel  relocation and recruiting fees of million  higher marketing  advertising  promotion and event costs of million  increase in commissions paid to sales representatives on higher sales totaling  higher personnel costs primarily for the addition of international sales and sales support personnel totaling  an increase in facilities expense of  and higher legal and accounting fees of  seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal 
sales and leases of our lasers are typically stronger in the second and fourth quarters and sales of our higher gross margin per procedure fees inclusive of disposable patient interfaces are typically stronger in the first quarter and slower in the third quarter

our capital expenditures for fixed assets consist primarily of capitalization of our lasers for use in manufacturing and developing our product offering  and information technology infrastructure and equipment used to support the growth of our business 
additionally  during the we paid approximately million  which is included in our purchases of property  plant and equipment in  and of related expenses for leasehold improvements and other expenditures related to our new rental facility in irvine  california 
our capital expenditures for revenue generating assets consist of the capitalization of lasers under operating leases 
working capital is required principally to finance accounts receivable and inventory  as well as to enable us to provide long term financing for customer laser purchases 
our initial public offering  which was effective under applicable securities laws on october  and closed on october   resulted in our receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock  including the sale of  over allotment shares 
the proceeds were net of expenses of million 
the net proceeds of the offering were used  in part  for the repayment of our bank debt in the amount of million and the payment to the university of michigan of  in addition   shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock converted to  shares of common stock 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  together with our marketable securities and investments and cash expected to be generated from sales of our product offering  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
our uses of cash included purchases of investment grade securities  for which million were held at december  with diversification among issuers and maturities ranging from one to months 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and investments with two major financial institutions in the united states and intend to hold our marketable securities and investments to maturity 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from a million use of cash in the increase of million was primarily due to a million increase caused by the improvement to net income in from a net loss in  an increase in deferred rent and lease incentives of million  and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in other assets of million  a decrease in stock based compensation of million and an increase in inventories of million  as well as changes in other assets and liabilities 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of payments for purchases of inventory during the fourth quarter of as compared to the timing of payments for purchases of inventory during the fourth quarter of and the remaining initial public offering expenses accrued but unpaid at december  however  the increase in cash used for inventory  accounts receivable and other assets  which included million of net 
table of contents notes receivable associated with our sales type leases  was due to our growing revenue  which resulted in higher balances in accounts receivable and inventory at december  as compared to december  the increase in deferred rent and lease incentives was primarily due to a million leasehold improvement allowance from the landlord of our new building 
net cash used by investing activities decreased to million in as compared to in this decrease of million was primarily due to the initial investment of our initial public offering proceeds in marketable securities in offset partially by an increase in the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million in that included approximately million for leasehold improvements and other expenditures related to our new rental facility in irvine  california paid by us and the million leasehold improvement allowance from the landlord of our new building 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million in as compared million in the decrease of million is primarily due to our initial public offering of common stock occurring in this decrease was offset by increases in net proceeds from the issuance of stock options under employee stock plans and the employee stock purchase plan of million in aggregate  the decrease net payment on long term debt of  and notes receivable payments received of  accounts receivable our accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days at december   compared to days at september   days at june   days at march   and days at december  the increase in days sales outstanding during and at december  was due to our introduction of credit terms for select international distributors in further described below and the increase in per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface  which generally have longer credit terms than lasers 
our laser sales in the us are typically on the basis of cash in advance paid directly by our customers or on terms  which are typically net  to fiscally sound third party financing companies  institutions or well established corporate customers 
our per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface are typically sold for terms net days from shipment 
international customers  primarily distributors  have typically paid with cash in advance or by irrevocable letter of credit  however  in the second quarter of  we began selling to selected and qualified distributors on credit terms 
we review our accounts receivable balances and customers regularly to establish and maintain an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
we take into account the customer s payment history  the number of days an account is overdue and any specific knowledge about an account s financial status 
the reserve requirements are based on our review of every account and we place particular emphasis on analyzing each account with an accounts receivable balance more than days old and on that account s specific payment history and financial risk 
on that basis  the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable was and at december  and december   respectively 
as we further extend terms to additional international distributors or increase their credit lines and per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface increase as a percentage of revenues  we expect days sales outstanding to increase 
our per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface generally have payment terms of a longer duration on these revenues than we do on our laser sales 
however  our expectation is that days sales outstanding will remain in the range of to days in the short term 
as extensions of international credit and per procedure fees inclusive of a disposable patient interface revenues increase  we will be exposed to an increased risk of not receiving payment on time for a portion of our sales 
in addition  as the percentage of our revenues with longer credit terms increase  we will use more capital resources to fund the increase in accounts receivable outstanding 
debt on august   we established a new revolving line of credit  which allows for maximum borrowing of million  with a million sub limit to secure cash management services and a million sub limit to secure letters of credit 
the line of credit has a variable rate of interest equal to the bank s prime rate at december  and matures august  the line of credit did not have an outstanding balance at december   and contains covenants for minimum quick ratio and profitability with which we were in compliance with at december  
table of contents contractual obligations the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years in thousands operating leases royalty payments letter of credit employment agreement with robert palmisano  president and ceo total on january  we entered into a lease agreement for a larger facility in irvine  california with approximately  square feet and completed the move during the third quarter of the lease is for a period of ten years and four months beginning may  represents minimum annual royalties under licensing agreements which continue until the soonest of the following expiration of the patents or termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms 
expires in april of in february of we entered into a new agreement with mr 
palmisano that will take effect when his current employment contract expires and is on substantially the same terms as the contract 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a ii of regulation s k under the securities act of income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the uncertainty of the timing and amount of our future earnings  if any 
accordingly  based upon available evidence and the criteria set forth in sfas  accounting for income taxes  we have established full deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december  and december  to reflect these uncertainties 
management will continue to assess the available evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets and at such time we determine that it is more likely than not that deferred taxes will be realized  a tax benefit will be realized and the valuation allowance will be released 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  which will expire on various dates beginning in through pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited if in the future we experience cumulative change in ownership of greater than in a moving three year period 
ownership changes would impact the company s ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards remaining at the ownership change date 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations during the periods presented  and we do not anticipate that it will have a material effect in the future 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  
table of contents inventories and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing elsewhere within this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total revenues to each deliverable based on its relative fair value in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and recognize revenues for each separate element as the above criteria are met 
reserves for doubtful accounts  billing adjustments and contractual allowances at the end of each fiscal quarter  we estimate the reserve necessary for doubtful accounts to ensure that we have established an appropriate allowance for accounts receivable that may not ultimately be collectible 
to develop this estimate we review all accounts and identify those with overdue balances  particularly those with balances days  or more  overdue 
for these accounts we estimate individual specific reserves based on our analysis of the amount overdue  the customer s payment history  operations and finances of each account 
for all other accounts  we review historical bad debt trends  general and industry specific economic trends  and current payments along with the reasonable probability that payment will occur in the future 
on that basis  the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable was and at december  and december   respectively 
to date  our estimates of our doubtful accounts have been materially accurate 
subject to any major changes in our business model  our operating environment or the economy in general  and taking into consideration our typical customer  we do not expect either our methodology or the accuracy of our estimates to change significantly in the future 
inventories adjustments to the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete items are based  in part  on our estimate of usage of component parts in the assembly of our lasers and the timing of design changes 
this estimate  though based on our product design plans and other relevant factors  such as the current economic climate  is subject to some uncertainty 
amounts charged to income for excess and obsolete inventories and as a percentage of total revenues  were million or of total revenues in as compared to  or of total revenues in to date  our estimates of excess and obsolete inventory have been materially accurate 
subject to any major changes in our business model  our operating environment or the economy in general  and taking into consideration the ongoing development of our technology we do not expect either our methodology or the accuracy of our estimates to change significantly in the future 
stock based compensation we account for employee and director stock options and restricted stock using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock options issued to non employees  who are principally surgeons on our medical advisory board  are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and amortized on a declining basis over the service period 

table of contents stock compensation expense  which is a noncash charge  results from stock option grants made to employees at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock  and from stock option grants made to non employees at the fair value of the option granted as determined using the black scholes valuation model 
stock compensation expense for grants made to employees below the fair value of the underlying common stock is amortized on a declining basis over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
unearned deferred compensation for non employees is periodically remeasured through the vesting date 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation representing the difference between the option exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the grant date for financial reporting purposes 
prior to issuing our stock publicly  we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including operating performance  liquidation preferences of the preferred stock  an independent valuation analysis  the market capitalization of peer companies and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of our common stock  different amounts of stock based compensation could have been reported 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million in from inception through december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million 
at december   we had a total of million remaining to be amortized over the vesting period of the stock options  of which  is subject to periodic remeasurement 
the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if unvested options for which we have recorded deferred compensation are subsequently cancelled or expire or if the fair value of our stock decreases  or may increase if the fair market value of our stock increases or we make additional grants of non qualified stock options to members of our medical advisory board or other non employee consultants 
pro forma information regarding net loss applicable to common stockholders and net loss per share applicable to common stockholders is required in order to show our net loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
this information is contained in note to our financial statements contained elsewhere within this form k 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to our option plan at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee stock option exercise price or restricted stock purchase price equals or exceeds the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment  which is a revision to sfas and supersedes apb and sfas this statement requires that the estimated fair value resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
if we had estimated the fair value of the options or restricted stock on the date of grant in our financial statements  and then amortized this estimated fair value over the vesting period of the options or restricted stock  our net income loss would have been adversely affected 
see note to our financial statements contained elsewhere within this form k for a discussion of how our net income loss would have been adversely affected 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  and december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits

sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value 
table of contents based method 
sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal management expects that we will use the modified prospective application method 
under sfas r  unearned deferred stock compensation for non employees will continue to be periodically remeasured through the vesting date 
this periodic remeasurement could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we believe that the adoption of sfas r will result in stock based compensation in of approximately million  the majority of which will arise from the adoption of sfas r  as compared to approximately million of stock based compensation recognized in however  actual results may vary depending upon stock option grants and stock compensation programs 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage to be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  our current accounting policies are consistent with the accounting required by sfas no 
and  as such  the adoption of this statement will have no effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apr opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles  as well as changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance it does not include specific transition provisions 
specifically  sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the effects of the change  the new accounting principle must be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and a corresponding adjustment must be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of the change the new principle must be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
does not change the transition provisions of any existing pronouncements 
we have evaluated the impact of sfas no 
and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we will apply sfas no 
in future periods  when applicable 
during the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which addresses certain aspects of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fas interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fas interpretation had no impact on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing the risk of loss 
some of the securities in which we may invest in the future may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we plan to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of marketable securities  which may include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
currently  we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and our borrowings 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
all of our sales since inception have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we expect to continue to realize our sales in us dollars  regardless of our intended expansion into international markets  although no assurances can be given 
as we increase our international sales and support organization  we anticipate some level of exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of compensating these employees in local currencies
