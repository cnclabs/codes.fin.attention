item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the section entitled reconciliation of non gaap financial measures 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations are more clearly understood when read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of december  undue reliance should not be placed upon historical financial statements since they are not indicative of expected results of operations or financial conditions for any future periods 
overview spirit finance corporation is a self managed and self advised reit formed as a maryland corporation on august  our objective is to acquire single tenant  operationally essential real estate throughout the united states to be leased on a long term  triple net basis to retail  distribution and service oriented companies 
single tenant  operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are free standing  commercial real estate facilities that are vital to the generation of our customers sales and profits 
a triple net lease generally requires the tenant to pay all operating and maintenance costs  insurance premiums and real estate taxes on the property 
we may also selectively originate or acquire long term  commercial mortgage loans that are integral to our strategy of providing a complete solution of financing products to our customers 
since we began purchasing real estate assets in december  we have completed over billion in real estate acquisitions and mortgage and equipment loan investments 
our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol sfc 
as of december   our investment portfolio totaled billion and represented owned or financed properties geographically diversified across states 
of our total investment portfolio as of december    million  or  represented the gross cost of real estate and related lease intangibles that we own and million  or  represented mortgage and equipment loans receivable 
only one state  texas  accounts for or more of the total dollar value of our real estate and loan portfolio 
our properties are leased or financed to customers operating in various industries 
our three largest property types at december  as a percentage of our total investment portfolio were restaurants  movie theaters and educational facilities 
as of december   our largest customers as a percentage of the total investment portfolio were carmike cinemas  inc nasdaq ckec  dickinson theatres  inc  carmax  inc 
nyse kmx  united supermarkets  ltd  main event entertainment  lp  the operator of main event family entertainment centers  pamco  inc  a petroleum distribution  convenience store and car wash operator  cbho  lp  the operator of camelback ski and camelbeach water park  university of phoenix nasdaq apol  gander mountain company nasdaq gmtn  and amc entertainment  inc these customers accounted for of our total investment portfolio at december   with no individual credit exposure greater than of the total investment portfolio 
in comparison  our top customers as of december  accounted for of our total investment portfolio  with the largest credit exposure at of the total portfolio 
as of december   all of our properties were occupied  and the monthly lease and loan payments were current 
we generate our revenue and cash flow primarily by leasing our real estate properties to our customers and from interest income on our portfolio of mortgage and equipment loans receivable 
our ability to generate positive cash flow will depend heavily on the difference between the income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
we expect to grow through continuing our principal strategy of acquiring single tenant  operationally essential real estate principally through sale leaseback transactions 
our ability to achieve our plan of continued growth is dependent on achieving a substantial volume of acquisitions at attractive yields without compromising our underwriting criteria and our ability to effectively finance those acquisitions to meet our targeted yields 
the current environment for net lease real estate acquisitions continues to be highly competitive  and this competitive environment could limit both the number of properties we acquire and the yield on those acquisitions 
we may delay or decline opportunities if we feel the rewards do not warrant the capital risk 
the timing of completing property acquisitions may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
in response to these challenges  we are committed to seeking numerous potential investment opportunities 
we currently have a full time acquisitions staff of six employees 
we anticipate that our experienced team will continue to provide a strong investment pipeline throughout we continue to seek opportunities to combine our cost of capital and operational structure with efficient leverage strategies to deliver competitively priced lease products to our customers 
we intend to fund future real estate investments primarily with borrowings on our secured credit facilities and by raising funds through the issuance of debt and additional equity securities 
liquidity and capital resources we completed a private offering in december and an initial public offering in december together with the exercise of underwriters over allotment options for both offerings  spirit finance raised aggregate proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriters discounts and offering expenses 
our real estate investments are acquired using a combination of cash and borrowings under our secured credit facilities 
as of december   we had a maximum aggregate borrowing capacity of million under our two secured credit facilities 
during  we acquired or financed commercial real estate properties through various transactions totaling million 
in conjunction with the acquisition of of these real estate properties  we assumed existing mortgage notes payable or obtained new long term  fixed rate financing totaling million 
we also used proceeds from the sale of some of our properties  totaling million in  to acquire new properties 
at december   we had contractual commitments totaling million for future improvements on properties we currently own 
in accordance with the underlying lease agreements  these improvements  the majority of which are anticipated to be completed during and  will result in increases in related contractual rent 
in addition  as of january  we had identified for review potential investment opportunities of more than billion 
we consider investments as under review when we have signed a confidentiality agreement  we have exchanged financial information or we or our advisors are in current and active negotiations 
investments under review are generally subject to significant change  and the timing of completing any such transactions  which are dependent on the completion of due diligence and other factors that may not be under our control  may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
after further due diligence  we may decide not to pursue any or all of these transactions  we may not be the successful bidder on all of the transactions we pursue and there is no assurance that we will ultimately complete any of the real estate acquisitions 
we primarily generate our revenue and cash flow by leasing our real estate properties to our customers 
we generally offer long term leases that provide for payments of base rent with scheduled increases  increases based on future changes in the consumer price index and or contingent rent based on a percentage of the lessee s gross sales 
at december   our weighted average noncancelable remaining initial lease term was approximately years  and our leases generally provide for one or more renewal options 
less than of the leases in our real estate investment portfolio at december  will expire prior to our leases are generally triple net  which provides that the lessee is responsible for the payment of all property operating expenses  such as insurance  real estate taxes and repairs and maintenance including any increased operating expenses that may have resulted from increases in oil prices during since our tenants generally pay the property operating and maintenance costs  we do not believe we will incur significant capital expenditures on our properties  for example  we did not incur any significant capital expenditures related to properties in the areas impacted by hurricanes during although we do not expect to make significant investments in mortgage and equipment loans  we may selectively originate or acquire such loans as opportunities arise in the market 
our real estate mortgage and equipment loans receivable  totaling million at december   generally require that our customers make monthly payments of principal and interest with balloon payments totaling million due in the mortgage loans receivable are secured by single tenant  operationally essential real estate 
our equipment loans receivable  representing less than of total loans receivable  are secured by equipment used in the operation of certain real estate properties we own 
we may also offer other financing products where we can improve our investment returns or competitiveness 
our operating costs include interest expense on our debt and the general and administrative costs of acquiring and managing our real estate investment portfolio  such as the compensation and benefit costs of our employees  professional fees such as legal and portfolio servicing costs and office expenses such as rent and other operating costs 
noncash expenses include depreciation expense on the buildings and improvements in our real estate portfolio  stock based compensation included in general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs included in interest expense 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased to million as compared to million for  primarily due to the significant growth we achieved over the past two years in the size of our portfolio 
cash flow from operations was negative for the period from inception through december   as we were primarily engaged in start up and organization activities 
we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders so that we distribute each year all or substantially all of our reit taxable income to avoid paying corporate level federal income tax and excise tax on our earnings 
during the initial years of our operations  the distributions we pay have included a return of capital 
cash for future distributions is expected to be generated from operations  although we may also borrow funds to make distributions 
our ability to pay distributions will depend on  among other things  our actual results of operations  which are dependent primarily on our receipt of payments from our leases and loans with respect to our real estate investments 
during  we declared dividends of per share or million as compared to per share or million during we raised our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of to per common share 
dividends paid during including those dividends declared in and paid in totaled million 
in order to continue to achieve growth in revenues and net income  we will need to continue to make substantial real estate acquisitions  which will in turn require that we obtain significant additional debt and equity funding beyond our currently committed external sources of liquidity 
we used proceeds from our initial public offering in december to pay down million of debt in december and in the first quarter of also during the first quarter of  we repaid million of variable rate mortgage notes payable outstanding at december  using cash and borrowings under then existing secured credit facilities 
we use secured credit facilities to partially fund the purchase of real estate pending the issuance of long term  fixed rate debt 
during  we established a million short term secured credit facility with bank of america mortgage capital corporation  and  in march  we added a million short term secured credit facility with citigroup global markets realty corp 
during the third quarter of  these facilities expired and the outstanding balances were paid in full 
in september  we established a million revolving secured credit facility with citigroup global markets realty corp 
the facility matures in september borrowings under the facility require monthly payments of interest indexed to one month libor plus 
in november  we established a one year million revolving short term secured credit facility with credit suisse 
the facility matures in november borrowings under this facility require monthly payments of interest indexed to one month libor plus and a non use fee may be incurred under certain circumstances 
the facilities are structured as master loan repurchase arrangements  and our borrowings under the facilities are secured by mortgages on specific properties we own 
in december  the citigroup facility was amended to permit an additional million of borrowings  for a total borrowing capacity of million under this facility 
the additional million of borrowings under the facility are secured by our equity ownership interest in one of the company s wholly owned  special purpose subsidiaries 
borrowings under this portion of the facility require monthly payments of interest based on one month libor plus  depending on amounts borrowed 
the interest rates on these borrowings are subject to increase in the event we exceed a specified leverage amount 
at december   the one month libor rate was and we had million outstanding on a maximum aggregate borrowing capacity of million under these credit facilities 
as described further in the notes to consolidated financial statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  since we initially fund our real estate acquisitions using our revolving credit facilities  we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates until we can put into place our long term  fixed rate debt strategies 
as of december   spirit finance had three outstanding forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
these derivative instruments were designated to hedge the variability of cash flows related to forecasted interest payments over a term of years on long term debt with an initial principal balance of at least million expected to be issued in in july  our special purpose subsidiary  spirit master funding  llc  issued million aggregate principal amount of net lease mortgage notes rated aaa aaa by standard poor s ratings services and moody s investors service  inc  respectively 
the private placement consisted of million of class a fully amortizing notes bearing interest at an annual rate of due in and million of class a interest only notes bearing interest at an annual rate of due in the timely payment of scheduled interest and ultimate payment of principal on the notes are guaranteed under an insurance policy issued by ambac assurance corporation 
the collateral pool securing the notes represents single tenant commercial real estate properties 
the notes may be prepaid at any time  subject to a yield maintenance prepayment premium  and the notes permit substitution of real estate collateral from time to time subject to certain conditions 
in addition  the note structure allows for the addition of collateral to the pool and the issuance of additional series of notes secured by the increased collateral pool of properties 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay balances outstanding under then existing secured credit facilities totaling million 
the remaining proceeds were used to provide funds for real estate acquisitions 
in conjunction with the issuance of the net lease mortgage notes  we settled two forward starting interest rate swap agreements in july for a net cash payment to the swap counterparty because long term rates had decreased since the inception of the swaps 
accordingly  the fair value of the interest rate swaps at the time of settlement  totaling million  is being amortized to earnings as an increase to interest expense over a year period such that the effective interest rate of the net lease mortgage notes approximates the long term rates in effect when the swaps were placed 
at december   our balance outstanding under the variable rate secured credit facilities was million and the total carrying amount of our fixed rate debt was million 
assets with an aggregate investment value of million and million were pledged as collateral for borrowings under the secured credit facilities and fixed rate debt  respectively 
over the long term  we expect lease rates to fluctuate commensurate with changes in long term interest rates 
in the near term  we may experience a period where long term interest rates on future borrowings rise faster than lease rates  which may reduce our cash flow 
therefore  in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  we seek to match fund our long term  fixed rate assets with long term  fixed rate liabilities 
at december   of our investment portfolio was match funded with long term debt 
we are subject to various customary operating and financial covenants under the mortgage notes payable and the secured credit facilities 
the mortgage notes payable and secured credit facilities include a limitation on our ability to incur additional indebtedness on the underlying secured real estate 
our secured credit facilities also include  among other requirements  a minimum liquidity requirement of million and a minimum tangible net worth requirement of million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and requirements 
in the short term  we believe that cash provided by our operating activities and the liquidity available on our secured credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the operating and financing obligations and commitments of our existing real estate investment portfolio 
on a long term basis  we intend to use a combination of debt and equity financing methods to accomplish our goal of acquiring real estate while maintaining our borrowings at a targeted leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of our total debt to total assets  of 
at december   our leverage ratio was 
we intend to obtain additional unsecured and or secured financing through various sources including banks  institutional investors and other lenders 
we may also obtain lines of credit  bridge loans  warehouse facilities and other debt arrangements or may incur debt in the form of publicly or privately placed debt instruments 
we intend to use substantially all of our properties to secure our borrowings under our various debt financings 
in addition  our ability to achieve continuous real estate investment growth will also depend on our ability to raise additional equity capital 
in february  we completed a public offering of million additional shares of common stock including the exercise of an underwriters overallotment option of million shares which raised aggregate proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriters discounts but before offering expenses 
we used million of the proceeds of the offering to pay down borrowings outstanding under one of our secured credit facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our off balance sheet and contractual obligations as of december  the contractual obligations relating to mortgages and notes payable listed in the table below are included in the consolidated balance sheet at december  total and thereafter dollars in thousands mortgages and notes payable     operating lease obligations     total      in addition  at december   we have contractual commitments totaling million for future improvements on properties we currently own 
these improvements include costs to be incurred on properties during which the tenant s business continues to operate without interruption and advances for the construction of new facilities for which operations have not commenced 
these improvements  the majority of which are anticipated to be completed during and  will result in increases in rental revenues 
these commitments are not included in the table above because they are not contracts to purchase goods or services 
results of operations we commenced operations on august  and have realized significant growth in revenues and net income per share due to the substantial growth in our real estate investment portfolio 
we reported a net loss of million during the period from inception august  to december   or per common share  based on million weighted average common shares outstanding 
our operations during the period from august to december  consisted primarily of start up and organization activities  therefore  we do not have any significant comparative operating data to present for net income for was million  or per diluted share  based on million weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 
net income for was million or per diluted share  based on million weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 
the increase in net income and earnings per share was reflective of the significant growth in our investment portfolio 
since we began purchasing real estate assets in december  we have completed over billion in real estate acquisitions and mortgage and equipment loan investments  of which million was completed during the increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding between and was primarily the result of our december initial public offering of million common shares 
the increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding between and was primarily the result of our december private offering of million common shares 
periodically  we may sell real estate properties that do not meet our long term strategic investment objectives 
such properties are typically acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of a portfolio of real estate properties 
we consider these occasional sales of real estate properties to be an integral part of our long term operating business strategy in acquiring a diversified real estate investment portfolio  consequently  proceeds from the sales of real estate properties are expected to be reinvested in additional properties such that cash flows from ongoing operations are not negatively affected by sales of individual properties 
in addition  we consider the combined effect of income from continuing operations and discontinued operations in our evaluation of our ability to pay dividends 
each time properties are sold  current accounting principles require that gains and losses from any such dispositions and all operations from the properties previously reported as part of income from continuing operations to be reclassified to discontinued operations 
this reclassification and presentation has no impact on net income or cash flows 
income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share 
income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share 
we sold properties during and four properties during income from discontinued operations totaled million  or per diluted share  for and  or per diluted share  for included in income from discontinued operations were net gains on sales of real estate of  during during  income from discontinued operations included net losses on sales of real estate of  the following discussion for the years ended december  and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations as summarized in the following table dollars in thousands continuing operations discontinued operations total operations revenues       general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization   interest     revenues in  total revenues increased to million from million in the increase in revenues during was primarily due to the growth in our investment portfolio due to property acquisitions made over the past two years 
over of the total revenues generated in were rental revenues from real estate properties we own and lease to our customers 
during  no single lessee represented more than of total revenues 
in comparison  during and  approximately and  respectively  of total revenues were derived under a single master lease agreement with one customer 
our long term leases generally provide for payments of base rents with scheduled increases  increases based on future changes in the consumer price index cpi and or contingent rent based on a percentage of the lessee s gross sales 
for leases with scheduled rent increases  rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  net of a valuation allowance  to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the leases 
rental revenue and the related weighted average real estate investments are presented in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  rental revenues  excluding the adjustment for straight line rent  straight line rent  net  total rental revenues   weighted average real estate investments   the weighted average yield on our real estate acquisitions was lower during than in  reflecting market lease rate compression and increased investments in properties leased to companies having higher credit profiles 
investments in properties leased to companies with higher credit profiles were designed to meet our total rate of return requirements as we were able to obtain efficient long term borrowings at rates ranging from to 
during and  interest income on mortgage and equipment loans receivable totaled million and million  respectively 
approximately of the interest income in was generated by mortgage loans to two borrowers 
the increase in interest income in over was primarily the result of the origination of million of new mortgage and equipment loans during other interest income represents income generated on interest bearing cash accounts pending investment in real estate 
other interest income totaled million in compared to million in expenses general and administrative expenses include employee related expenses  professional fees  portfolio servicing costs and office and other expenses 
employee related expenses increased as a result of the increase in our number of employees from at december  to at december   primarily due to the growth in our real estate investment portfolio 
the large increase in the number of properties in our portfolio has resulted in increased portfolio servicing costs and higher insurance costs and franchise taxes  which costs will continue to grow proportionately with the growth in our investment portfolio 
depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to real estate properties and related lease intangibles 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in as compared to million in the increase in was primarily the result of the increase in the average total dollar value of the real estate investment portfolio 
interest expense for totaled million  including million associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs  debt insurer premiums and the amortization of interest rate swap settlement costs  on weighted average outstanding debt of approximately million 
for  interest expense totaled million  including  associated with the amortization of related deferred financing costs  on weighted average outstanding debt of approximately million 
the increase in libor rates of approximately two percentage points over the past year has contributed to the increase in interest expense on our short term variable rate debt 
due to the continued expansion of operations as a result of our real estate investment activity during and  our general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase during  however  general and administrative expenses calculated as a percent of total revenues are expected to decrease 
depreciation and amortization expense is also expected to increase in future periods with future real estate acquisition activity 
interest expense is expected to increase in future periods as we continue to make investments in real estate funded with both short and long term debt financing 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we use certain measures of historical or future financial performance that are different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
one such non gaap financial measure is funds from operations ffo 
we use ffo as a measure of our performance as a reit because we believe this measure provides investors with an understanding of our operating performance  cash flows and profitability 
we calculate ffo consistent with the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  adopted to promote an industry wide standard measure of reit operating performance 
we use ffo as a measure of performance to adjust for certain non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization because accounting for real estate assets under gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
we disclose ffo to facilitate comparisons between spirit finance and other reits  although other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and  accordingly  our ffo may not be directly comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of profitability  nor should it be considered an equivalent to cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
spirit finance s statements of operations and cash flows include disclosures of interest expense  capital expenditures and items excluded from the calculation of ffo  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance 
ffo totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  including million and million  respectively  representing the adjustment between scheduled rents and rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis 
during the period from inception august  through december   ffo was a negative million 
a reconciliation of net income calculated in accordance with gaap to ffo for the years ended december  and and for the date of inception august  to december  is presented in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  date of inception august  to december  net income loss    portfolio depreciation and amortization expense continuing operations   discontinued operations net gains losses on sales of real estate ffo    significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies our accounting policies are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and consequently our actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
estimates and assumptions include  among other things  subjective judgment with regard to the fair values and useful lives of our properties for depreciation purposes and for classification of leases as either operating or capital leases  judgment regarding the collectibility of receivables and asset impairment analysis  assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments and judgment required to estimate the fair value and hedge effectiveness of our derivative financial instruments 
listed below are the more critical accounting policies that require management judgment and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we lease real estate to our customers under long term net leases that are classified as operating leases 
throughout the lease term  the leases may include scheduled rent escalations or escalations based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases may also provide for contingent rent based on a percentage of the lessee s gross sales 
we recognize contingent rentals as revenue when the change in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occurs 
for leases with scheduled rent escalations  rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease  net of a portfolio valuation allowance based on management s evaluation of the risks associated with these receivables  giving consideration to industry default rates for long term receivables 
accrued rental revenue  calculated as the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents and rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis  represents unbilled rent receivables that we will receive only if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
in the event a lessee s monthly lease payments become more than days past due  we will suspend revenue recognition on that lease until collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize interest income on mortgage loans receivable using the effective interest method applied on a loan by loan basis 
direct costs associated with originating loans are offset against any related fees received and the balance  along with any premium or discount  is deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the terms of the related mortgage loans receivable using the effective interest method 
a loan is placed on non accrual status when the loan has become days past due  or earlier  if in our opinion  full recovery of the contractual principal and interest becomes doubtful 
while on non accrual status  interest income is recognized only when received 
real estate investments investments in real estate are recorded at cost  including acquisition and closing costs 
for real estate acquired subject to existing lease agreements  we must allocate a portion of the purchase price of our real estate investments between the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  which requires us to make subjective assessments regarding their estimated fair values 
we primarily use independent appraisals to support our estimates of the fair value of our real estate 
we also make subjective assessments regarding the useful lives of our investments in real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis 
depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years for buildings and years for land improvements 
impairment of real estate investments we make subjective assessments in our periodic review of our real estate investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
management considers factors such as expected future operating income  estimated residual value  market trends such as the effects of leasing demand and competition and other factors in making this assessment 
in general  if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the carrying amount of our real estate investments is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets 
if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying amount of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment losses  it could have a material impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 
loan impairment we periodically evaluate our mortgage loans receivable  including accrued interest  for collectibility by analyzing the underlying property level economics and trends  collateral value and quality and other relevant factors in determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
a loan is determined to be impaired when  in our judgment based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
specific allowances for losses are provided for impaired loans on an individual loan basis in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less disposition costs 
accounting developments see the new accounting pronouncements section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk spirit finance is exposed to various financial market risks  especially interest rate risk 
interest rates and credit risk influence our performance more so than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
we generally offer leases that provide for payments of base rent with scheduled increases  increases based on changes in the consumer price index and or contingent rent based on a percentage of the lessee s gross sales to help mitigate the effect of inflation 
because the properties in our portfolio are generally leased to tenants under triple net leases where the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses  this tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and global economic and political conditions  and other factors which are beyond our control 
our operating results will depend heavily on the difference between the income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternate income producing investments 
increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate we have targeted for acquisition 
in such circumstances  if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to acquire real estate with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings 
in a rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults may increase and result in credit losses which may adversely affect our liquidity and operating results  through december   we have not experienced any significant credit losses 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  borrowers are generally more likely to prepay their loans in order to obtain financing at lower interest rates  however  our investments in mortgage loans receivable are subject to significant restrictions on prepayment in the form of yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment penalties which provide us with a certain level of yield protection in a decreasing interest rate environment 
our interest rate risk management policy seeks to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations 
one objective of our interest rate risk management policy is to match fund fixed rate assets with fixed rate liabilities and variable rate assets with variable rate liabilities 
as part of this strategy  we have used and may continue to use derivative contracts  such as interest rate swaps  to manage our interest rate risk 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we generally intend to utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on our liabilities and not use derivatives for other purposes  such as hedging asset related risks 
hedging transactions may generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining our reit status 
our hedging strategy is monitored by the audit committee of our board of directors 
at december   our fixed rate debt totaled million as compared to million at december  using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows  market rates and credit spreads  the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt was approximately million below its carrying amount at december  our mortgage loans receivable are also fixed rate instruments 
at december   our mortgage loans receivable excluding equipment loans totaled million as compared to million at december  using a discounted cash flow analysis  the estimated fair value of our fixed rate mortgage loans receivable exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million at december  it is our intent to hold our fixed rate mortgage loans receivable and our fixed rate mortgages and notes payable to maturity  accordingly  changes in market interest rates impact the fair value of these financial instruments but have no impact on interest recognized or cash flows 
we use variable rate debt to fund acquisitions on a short term basis until our long term debt strategies can be implemented 
during  the weighted average outstanding balance of our variable rate debt  which was based on spreads over one month libor  was million 
excluding amortization of deferred financing costs  this variable rate indebtedness had a weighted average interest rate of 
during  one month libor has increased approximately two percentage points 
had the weighted average interest rate been basis points higher lower during  our net income would have been reduced increased by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate change on our average variable rate borrowings outstanding during and assumes no other changes in our capital structure 
on october   we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  and on march   we entered into an additional forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
in july  the anticipated long term debt was issued  and the interest rate swaps were settled for a net cash payment to the swap counterparty because long term rates had decreased since the inception of the swaps 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at the time of settlement  totaling million  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized to earnings as an increase to interest expense over a period of years 
the unamortized balance of the settled interest rate swaps at december  was million 
because the anticipated interest payments are considered probable  the hedges continue to be effective 
as of december   spirit finance had three outstanding forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
these derivative instruments were designated to hedge the variability of cash flows related to forecasted interest payments over a term of years on long term debt with an initial principal balance of at least million expected to be issued in as the hedging relationships are expected to be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows  these interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps resulted in a net unrealized loss of  at december  had market interest rates been basis points lower at december   the net unrealized loss would have been approximately million  had market interest rates been basis points higher at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap would have been a net unrealized gain of approximately million 
hedge effectiveness is assessed using the hypothetical derivative method  no hedge ineffectiveness was recognized through the income statement during or even with hedging strategies in place  there can be no assurance that our results of operations will remain unaffected as a result of changes in interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve additional risks such as counterparty credit risk and basis risk 
basis risk in a hedging contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged item is based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
we address basis risk by matching  to a reasonable extent  the contract index to the index upon which the hedged item is based 
to manage the risk of nonperformance by counterparties  our interest rate risk management policy requires that we deal only with major financial institutions that have credit ratings no lower than a from a nationally recognized rating agency 
our counterparties at december  met this criteria
