executive overview herman miller uses problem solving design and innovation to create great places to work  heal  live  and learn for our customers 
we do this by providing high quality products and related knowledge services 
at present  most of our customers come to us for work environments 
our primary products include furniture systems  seating  storage and material handling solutions  freestanding furniture  and casegoods 
our services extend from workplace and real estate strategy to furniture asset management 
our primary domestic manufacturing operations are located in michigan and georgia 
we also have a significant manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  which represents our largest marketplace outside the united states 
in addition to sales in the united kingdom  our products are sold internationally through wholly owned subsidiaries or branches in various countries including canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  australia  singapore  china  india  and the netherlands 
our products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships and licensees 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller production system hmps 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
as a result  the rate of our inventory turns is high 
these combined factors could cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low in relation to sales volume 
a key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while at the same time retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
our business is comprised of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how we internally report and evaluate financial information used to make operating decisions 
the operating segments are organized by the various markets we serve  including traditional office  healthcare  and educational environments in north america 
other primary operating segments include the office furniture market outside north america as well as the north american residential furniture market 
for external reporting purposes  we aggregate these operating segments as follows 
north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products for office  healthcare  and educational environments  throughout the united states  canada  and mexico 
non north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products  primarily for work related settings  outside north america 
other includes our north american residential furniture business as well as other business activities such as our startup businesses associated with the herman miller creative office  variable interest entities  and unallocated corporate expenses 

table of contents core strengths we rely on the following core strengths in delivering workplace solutions to our customers 
problem solving design and innovation we are committed to developing aesthetically and functionally innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research and design staff as well as external design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence we were among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
we are committed to continuously improving both product quality and production efficiency 
building and leading networks we value relationships in all areas of our business 
we consider our networks of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among the most important competitive factors vital to the long term success of our business 
channels of distribution our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms of between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at june   we owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary ie  sales to the ie federal government 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
we believe independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is  on balance  the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this in mind  our strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition our owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  our goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
challenges ahead like all businesses  we are faced with a host of challenges and risks 
we believe our core strengths and values  which provide the foundation for our strategic direction  have us well prepared to respond to the inevitable challenges we will face in the future 
while we are confident in our direction  we believe it prudent to acknowledge and remain mindful of the risks specific to our business and industry 
refer to item a of our annual report on form k for discussion of certain of these risk factors 
future avenues of growth we believe we are well positioned to successfully pursue our mission despite the risks and challenges we face 
that is  we believe we can continue to invent solutions that create great places 
in pursuing our mission  we have identified the following as key avenues for our future growth 
primary markets capturing additional market share within our existing primary markets by offering superior solutions to customers who value space as a strategic tool 
table of contents adjacent markets further applying our core skills in environments such as healthcare  higher education  and residential developing economies expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential new markets developing new products and technologies that serve wholly new markets industry performance the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we closely monitor the trade statistics reported by bifma and consider them among the key indicators of industry wide sales and order performance 
we also analyze bifma statistical information over several quarters as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic us business 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of many considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions our fiscal year ended june   included weeks of operations as opposed to a typical week period 
this extra week is required approximately every six years in order to realign our fiscal reporting dates with the actual calendar months 
this is a factor that should be considered when comparing our financial results in fiscal to fiscal years and we made meaningful progress toward our long term strategic objectives during fiscal our second consecutive year of double digit sales growth moved us closer to our goal of doubling net sales between fiscal years and we added innovative new products to our portfolio with the introduction of two new systems furniture platforms  a new executive chair  and an innovative task light 
we further expanded our presence in the healthcare and educational markets through the establishment of alliances with brandrud  inc  and bretford  inc 
we laid the foundation of our planned expansion into mainland china by establishing our legal trading structure  obtaining showroom space in shanghai  and expanding our network of independent dealers 
we were also very excited to be recognized  once again  by fortune magazine as the most admired company in the contract furniture industry 
the publication ranked us first in our industry in innovation  employee talent  social responsibility  and quality of products 
market demand in the domestic contract furniture industry was strong throughout the fiscal year  bolstered by the general health of the economy 
in may  bifma issued its updated industry forecast 
the report outlined the general expectation that office furniture consumption would continue to grow through the second half of calendar year and through calendar  though at a more moderate level 
specifically  the forecast cited a rebound in nonresidential construction  falling office vacancy rates  and record high corporate profits as factors driving the improved industry conditions 
growing employment rates have also had a positive impact on this trend  however  the employment growth rate is forecast to slow in the second half of calendar and into similar to what we saw in fiscal years and  increasing market prices for key manufacturing commodities posed a challenge to our profitability this past year 
we were encouraged to see price stabilization in the steel market during the current year 
however  this good news was more than offset by increases in other commodities 
oil and natural gas prices increased early in the year  particularly after the hurricanes in the gulf region 
these increases had an immediate effect on our transportation and manufacturing process costs 
this was followed by increases in the price of petroleum based products such as plastics and resins 
we also saw a ramp up in the price of aluminum and particleboard  particularly in the second half of the fiscal year 
we continue to closely monitor the markets for all of our key manufacturing materials and view the prospect of further increases as an outlook risk to the business 
these rising material costs have prompted us to raise our product prices twice since the beginning of fiscal the first increase  which became effective in august  varied by product line but averaged approximately percent of list price 
in september  just after the end of our first quarter  we implemented another price increase 
this increase again varied by product line but averaged approximately 
table of contents percent of list price 
while the markets in which we do business are highly price competitive  we were pleased by the degree to which these price increases were accepted in the marketplace 
these price increases have  to a large extent  allowed us to absorb the negative impact of rising commodity costs 
given the competitive nature of discounting in our industry  these price increases may not fully offset the impact of rising material costs in the future 
however  we continue to believe we can cover a large portion of these cost increases through the combination of our pricing strategy and hmps 
part of our strategy in addressing competitive pricing pressure is to differentiate ourselves through design and innovation 
our goal is to demonstrate to our customers that price is but one of several important factors to consider in the buying decision 
with this in mind  we continue to vigorously pursue new product development initiatives 
we incurred design and research expenses  including royalty payments to independent designers  of million in fiscal year this level of investment over the past three years has resulted in the introduction of several new products 
in june we introduced a redesign of abak a freestanding desk system 
we then introduced the celle chair and babble technology 
following the best of neocon innovation award for  celle was awarded the national ergonomics conference and exposition people s choice award and was named as a editors choice by buildings magazine 
babble  a voice privacy technology  won several awards over the past year  including a best of innovations award at the consumer electronics show 
babble was also named innovation of the year by the new york times 
we were also pleased with the recognition our new products received at the neocon trade show this past june 
our product introductions in june included two systems furniture platforms my studio environments tm and vivo tm interiors 
the foray tm chair  an executive task chair made by geiger  and leaf tm  an innovative led desk lamp  were also presented at the show 
my studio environments received a gold award as well as the coveted best of competition honors 
leaf received the gold award in the lighting category and foray received silver for ergonomic task seating 
in addition to this new product recognition  we received the manufacturer of the year award from the office furniture dealer alliance 
financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated 
chg chg dollars in millions fiscal from fiscal from fiscal net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses restructuring expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense minority interest  net of tax na cumulative effect of accounting change  net na na net earnings does not include expenses recognized in connection with our restructuring activities as these are reported on a separate line for the purposes of this analysis 

table of contents net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for fiscal totaled  million  which represents a year over year increase of percent 
the additional week in fiscal added approximately million in net sales to the period 
excluding the impact of this extra week of operations  the year over year growth in net sales totaled approximately percent 
this increase was driven by gains in both our north american and non north american furniture solutions business segments 
throughout fiscal we continued to be affected by market pricing pressures in the form of year over year increases in the level of price discounting 
however  this was more than offset by benefits from the general price increases put in place since august it is difficult to quantify with certainty the year over year benefit to our total net sales  however  our best estimate is that we were able to capture approximately to percent of the price increases  net of discounting  in both fiscal years and consolidated net trade orders in fiscal of  million increased percent over the prior year 
excluding the extra week of operations in the current year  order growth between fiscal and totaled approximately percent 
on a weekly average basis  new orders in fiscal year approximated million  an amount that slightly outpaced net sales 
our average weekly order pacing in the current year declined slightly between the first half and second half of the year  reflecting traditional seasonality driven in part by the timing of the federal government fiscal year and the december holiday season 
the backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  which represents an increase of percent from the prior year level of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of two wholly owned contract furniture dealerships one based in new york city  new york  and another in cleveland  ohio 
another first quarter development involved an independently owned dealership that we began consolidating as a variable interest entity vie under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r at the end of fiscal due to the dealership s improved financial condition  the owners were successful in obtaining outside bank financing 
this allowed them to repay a large portion of their outstanding loan balance with us 
as a result  we were no longer required to include this vie in our consolidated financial statements after the first quarter 
these dealership transitions affect our year over year comparisons 
we estimate that net sales from these dealers totaled approximately million in fiscal  while net sales from such dealers in the first quarter of the current fiscal year  before the transitions  totaled million 
net trade orders from these dealerships totaled approximately million in fiscal compared to only million in the current year 
our ending backlog for fiscal included approximately million related to these dealers 
bifma reported an estimated year over year increase in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent and orders of percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  net sales and order growth for our domestic us business totaled approximately percent and percent  respectively 
it is important to note that these growth percentages  both for our domestic us business as well as the bifma amounts  include the impact of our extra week of operations in fiscal and the year to year impact of the dealership transitions discussed above 
taking these factors into consideration  we believe our net sales and order performance in fiscal indicates that we have been successful in capturing domestic us market share 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales in fiscal of  million increased percent from sales of  million in fiscal this growth occurred across the majority of our operations and was especially strong in our non north american furniture solutions segment where we posted a percent increase 
in particular  net sales growth in the united kingdom  australia  and singapore was a highlight in fiscal 
table of contents net trade orders in fiscal of  million increased percent over our fiscal level of  million 
during fiscal  we saw a similar seasonal trend in weekly order pacing as we experienced in the current fiscal year 
our ending backlog for fiscal was approximately percent higher than the fiscal level 
the adoption of fin r as of may   affected the year over year comparison of net sales and orders between fiscal years and in connection with the adoption  we began consolidating two variable interest entities vies  which increased our fiscal net sales and orders by approximately million and million  respectively 
discussion of business segments business in our north american furniture solutions segment remained strong throughout fiscal net sales for this segment totaled  million  compared to  million in fiscal this represents a percent increase in net sales 
we experienced growth  to varying degrees  across the entire segment  with the largest gains coming from our core office environment and healthcare businesses 
we posted net sales in our non north american furniture solutions segment of million in fiscal the year over year increase in net sales within this segment totaled percent  much of it driven by business in the united kingdom  continental europe  australia  and brazil 
we achieved these increases despite downward pressure from currency exchange rates relative to the prior year 
in particular  our year over year net sales comparison in this segment was affected by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the british pound sterling  euro  and japanese yen 
we estimate the change in currency exchange rates between fiscal years and effectively decreased the us dollar value of net sales in our non north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million in fiscal on a consolidated basis  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar had a minimal effect on our net sales in fiscal this is because the adverse exchange rate movements within our non north american markets were offset  in large part  by the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
we estimate the year over year change in exchange rates effectively decreased the us dollar value of our consolidated net sales by approximately million for fiscal by comparison  we estimate the change in exchange rates between fiscal years and had the opposite impact  effectively increasing the us dollar value of our fiscal consolidated net sales by approximately million 
this was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
the remainder of our report within management s discussion and analysis focuses on what we believe to be the most significant factors affecting our consolidated financial results  without specific reference to the impact within individual business segments 
we believe discussion at this level provides the most meaningful basis for understanding the key drivers of our business performance 
refer to note for further information regarding the financial performance of our business segments in fiscal years   and 
table of contents percent of net sales analysis the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal year ended june  may  may  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a design and research expenses restructuring expenses total operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense minority interest  net of tax na cumulative effect of accounting change  net na na net earnings minority interest  net of tax for fiscal years and was not significant on a percent of sales basis 
the cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal was not significant on a percent of sales basis 
gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our current year gross margin of percent was our highest since fiscal year on a percent of sales basis  our gross margin for fiscal improved points from the comparable period in the prior year 
this year over year increase was primarily due to the benefits of better realization on price increases and improvements in overhead and direct labor 
however  these favorable factors were partially offset by higher material costs and freight costs 
overhead  as a percentage of sales  improved significantly from the prior year due to leverage gained on higher sales volume  despite an increase in actual dollar spending 
this rise in spending was primarily the result of an increase in medical benefit costs  pension expenses  incentive compensation expenses  utility costs  and other items that vary with sales volume 
specifically  the combined expenses related to pension and incentive compensation for fiscal increased million over last year 
direct labor  as a percentage of sales  also improved over the prior year as a result of operational efficiencies and leverage gained on higher production levels 
during the current year we experienced substantial cost increases for certain key manufacturing materials such as aluminum  plastics  and particleboard 
despite this  material costs as a percentage of net sales increased only slightly from our fiscal level due to the net benefit realized from price increases during the year 
steel prices  which have negatively affected our gross margin performance in recent years  stabilized during the current year and  in fact  improved slightly 
consequently  the year over year impact of steel costs in fiscal was relatively minimal 
still  the prospect of future increases in the price of critical manufacturing inputs remains a concern 
we continue to believe our lean manufacturing efforts in connection with hmps  combined with our pricing strategy  will allow us to cover a large portion of potential future price increases in direct material costs 
freight costs  as a percentage of sales  increased percentage points in fiscal due to higher fuel prices and increased shipments to higher cost freight zones 
fiscal compared to fiscal the percentage point improvement in gross margin between fiscal years and was driven primarily by improved fixed cost leverage resulting from the significant increase in net sales over the prior year 
this increase in net sales was bolstered in part by our august price increase 
additionally  during fiscal we benefited from a full year of the operating efficiencies gained from our restructuring plan 
this resulted in a notable reduction in direct labor and manufacturing overhead expenses as measured on a percent of sales basis 
these improvements were achieved despite year over year increases in direct material costs  a million increase in incentive compensation expenses  and increased competitive pricing pressure compared to fiscal 
table of contents direct material costs increased in fiscal on both a dollar and percent of sales basis 
we experienced significant direct material price increases during fiscal  particularly in the area of steel components 
we estimate the increased market price of steel alone reduced our fiscal consolidated gross margin  as a percent of net sales  by as much as percentage points 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we began realizing the labor and overhead cost benefits of consolidating our canton  georgia  operation into existing space in west michigan 
these benefits continued through the following year and  as a result  our fiscal direct labor costs as a percent of net sales were comparatively lower 
operating expenses and operating earnings fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses in fiscal declined points due to improved operating leverage on higher sales volume 
total dollar spending in fiscal was  however  significantly above our fiscal level 
operating expenses of million in the current year increased million from the fiscal amount of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a significant reserve adjustment  which resulted in a reduction to our fiscal operating expenses 
in april  we reported that we had reached a settlement with the general services administration gsa concerning a prior audit of the to multiple award schedule contract 
in light of the settlement  which required us to pay the gsa million  we reevaluated our balance sheet reserves related to all gsa contract periods 
as a result of this evaluation  we made the determination that these reserves should be reduced 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to the reserves  which reduced our pre tax operating expenses by approximately million 
approximately million of this adjustment related to the elimination of the remaining reserves  beyond the amount of the settlement  allocable to the to contract period 
the remainder of the adjustment related to our reevaluation of required reserves for open contract periods that had not yet been subject to audit 
the dealership transitions that occurred in the first quarter of this year also had a significant impact on the year over year operating expense comparison 
operating expenses incurred by these dealers in the prior year totaled million  while operating expenses incurred by such dealers in the first quarter of the current year  before the transitions  totaled only million 
excluding the comparative impact of the dealership transitions and fiscal gsa reserve adjustment  operating expenses in fiscal were approximately million higher than in fiscal the majority of this year over year increase is attributable to higher variable selling costs associated with the increase in net sales  incentive compensation expense associated with increased profitability  warranty expense  pension and medical benefit costs  legal expenses  marketing  new product development  and charitable donations 
specifically  combined expenses for fiscal related to incentive compensation  pension  and donations increased million from the prior year 
we also incurred additional compensation expenses in the current year  totaling approximately million in operating expenses  as a result of the extra week of operations 
furthermore  as discussed  we had what may be the largest slate of new product introductions in our history during fiscal this drove an increase in design and research expenses as well as marketing spending in the year 
the increase in warranty expenses over the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in net sales for the period 
in addition  a portion of the increase was due to the establishment of liabilities for specific warranty matters that became known during the year 
the majority of the specific items identified during the year related to products manufactured prior to the implementation of our current quality testing protocol 
refer to note for further information regarding warranty matters 

table of contents the increase in legal expenses in the current year was partially due to costs incurred in proactively protecting the value of our intellectual property assets 
we also incurred expenses during fiscal in establishing our legal trading structure in mainland china 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we established an estimated liability associated with the previously disclosed new york attorney general investigation regarding the minimum advertised price program maintained by our herman miller for the home division 
for further information regarding pending legal contingencies  refer to note finally  as discussed in note  our fiscal operating expenses included a pre tax charge totaling approximately million related to a long term lease arrangement in the united kingdom 
fiscal compared to fiscal the comparison of operating expenses between fiscal and fiscal was also significantly affected by the gsa reserve adjustment discussed above 
exclusive of this adjustment  selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal increased by approximately million  or percent from the prior year level 
a significant portion of this increase related to higher fiscal spending on marketing activities related to new product launches as well as in categories that vary with sales volume  such as sales incentive compensation 
another factor contributing to the year over year expense increase in fiscal was the consolidation of additional dealership financial results 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of office interiors  inc  a contract furniture dealership based in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
also in the first quarter of fiscal  we began consolidating the financial operations of two independent dealers considered vies under fin r 
the consolidation of these dealers increased our total fiscal operating expenses by approximately million in comparison to fiscal also  our fiscal operating expenses included a pre tax credit of million related to the reversal of a previously established legal accrual balance 
this adjustment was recorded early in fiscal as a result of a favorable court ruling related to a previous lawsuit 
additional items affecting operating earnings changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar have also had an effect on our operating expense comparisons 
we estimate the year over year change in exchange rates effectively decreased the us dollar value of our international operating expenses by million in fiscal by comparison  we estimate that year over year changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an increase of approximately million in fiscal relative to the previous year 
design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
these expenses include royalty payments to designers of our products as the products are sold 
we consider such royalty payments  which totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  to be variable costs of the products being sold 
accordingly  we do not include them in research and development costs as discussed in note restructuring charges in the current and prior fiscal years primarily related to the canton  georgia consolidation 
our canton facility  which was exited in fiscal  remains listed for sale 
therefore  the carrying values of the canton assets  which were previously reduced to their estimated fair market values totaling million  remain classified as long term in net property and equipment at the end of fiscal refer to note for more information regarding restructuring activities 
restructuring expenses incurred in fiscal also related primarily to the canton consolidation 

table of contents operating earnings rose percent to a total of million or percent of net sales in fiscal by comparison  operating earnings in fiscal totaled million or percent of net sales 
we reported operating earnings of million or percent of net sales in fiscal year other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the year over year increase resulted primarily from two dealership transactions in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax gain totaling approximately million related to the ownership transition of one of the vie s we initially began consolidating at the end of fiscal also during the first quarter of last year  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of an independent contract furniture dealership 
in doing so  we recognized a pre tax gain of million due to the reversal of a financial guarantee liability 
these gains were reflected as a reduction to net other expenses in fiscal interest expense had a minimal impact on the year over year comparison of net other expenses for fiscal while interest rates have been rising  the impact on expense was mitigated by our lower outstanding debt levels in comparison to the prior year 
the year over year decline in net other expenses between fiscal years and was primarily due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from lower overall debt levels 
additionally  fiscal interest income was higher than the prior year due to the impact of comparatively higher interest rates on our cash and investment balances 
foreign currency transactions resulted in a net gain of million for fiscal compared to net gains of million in the prior year and million in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in fiscal versus percent in fiscal the current year effective rate was below the statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits from r d activities  increased export sales  and the manufacturing deduction under the american jobs creations act of ajca 
in addition  we recorded a tax benefit totaling approximately million during fiscal related to one time adjustments to accrued taxes 
the effective rate in fiscal was higher than the statutory rate due primarily to a tax charge  recorded in the fourth quarter  related to our planned cash repatriation under the ajca 
as a result of our planned repatriation of approximately million  we recorded tax expense of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also recorded tax true ups in the fourth quarter of fiscal  driven by tax law changes  as well as other federal  state  and international accrual adjustments 
our effective tax rate in fiscal totaled percent 
in that year  we recorded a million benefit from the release of tax reserves as a result of the closure of irs audits for the years through we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and percent 
for further information regarding income taxes  refer to note cumulative effect of accounting change we adopted fin r at the end of fiscal this new accounting standard broadened the rules for determining whether a company is required to consolidate the financial statements of another entity 
fin r required us to consolidate the financial statements of two independent contract furniture dealerships to which we had provided ongoing financial support through loans and or financial guarantees 
as a result of this consolidation  our fiscal consolidated statement of operations included a non cash cumulative effect loss of million  or slightly less than per share  net of tax 
as this new accounting standard was adopted at the end of fiscal  the consolidation had no material impact on our fiscal consolidated statement of operations beyond that of the cumulative effect 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  a qualifying triggering event occurred with one of the vies which resulted in reconsideration under fin r 
based on this reconsideration  it was determined that we were no longer considered the primary beneficiary 
as such  we recorded the ownership transition and ceased consolidation of the dealership in the first quarter of fiscal this resulted in a pre tax gain of million  which we recorded as other expenses income in the consolidated statement of operations 
excluding the gain on the ownership transition in the first quarter  the consolidation of the remaining vie reduced net earnings by million in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  a qualifying triggering event occurred with the remaining vie which resulted in reconsideration under fin r 
based on this reconsideration  it was determined we were no longer considered the primary beneficiary 
as such  we ceased consolidation of the independent dealership in the first quarter of fiscal this resulted in a pre tax loss of million which is reflected in other expenses income in the consolidated statement of operations 
net earnings in the first quarter of fiscal were not significantly affected by the consolidation of this vie up to the point of the qualifying triggering event 
this is because the net earnings of the vie were primarily attributed to  and therefore offset by  minority interest of million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on fin r 
net earnings net earnings in fiscal totaled approximately million or per diluted share 
in fiscal  we generated net earnings of million or per diluted share 
earnings per share in fiscal include income of approximately per share  net of taxes  from the adjustment to gsa reserves as previously discussed 
in addition  net earnings in fiscal were reduced by approximately per diluted share from taxes related to our then anticipated cash repatriation under the ajca 
net earnings in fiscal year totaled million or approximately per diluted share 
the per share impact of restructuring charges  net of income taxes  was less than in fiscal in fiscal years and  after tax restructuring charges totaled approximately and per share  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights for the fiscal years indicated 
in millions cash and cash equivalents  end of period short term investments  end of period cash generated from operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for financing activities restructuring related cash outflows pension plan contributions capital expenditures stock repurchased and retired interest bearing debt  end of period available unsecured credit facility  end of period amounts shown include the fair market value of the company s interest rate swap arrangements 
the net fair value of these arrangements was million at june  and negligible as of may   respectively 
amounts shown are net of outstanding letters of credit  which are applied against the company s unsecured credit facility  excluding the million accordion feature disclosed in note at the end of fiscal year  we reported our plan to take advantage of the one time tax deduction related to the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the ajca 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we repatriated approximately million of undistributed earnings from certain of our foreign entities 
an additional million of undistributed foreign earnings was repatriated during the second quarter of fiscal our dividend reinvestment plan requires these funds to be used for capital purchases and investment in research and development 

table of contents cash flow operating activities cash flows from operating activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million last year 
changes in working capital balances resulted in a million source of cash during fiscal compared to a million source of cash in the prior year 
the source of working capital cash flow in the current fiscal year resulted principally from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  namely employee compensation and warranty accruals 
this was partially offset by volume related increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels  excluding the effects of inventory changes related to the three dealerships we no longer own or consolidate under fin r 
by comparison  the cash source in working capital for fiscal was primarily the result of higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities for employee compensation and benefits and income taxes 
partially offsetting these favorable balance changes were volume related increases in inventory and accounts receivable during fiscal year  changes in working capital balances resulted in a net use of cash totaling million 
in that period  we experienced a decrease in accrued income taxes and increases in both accounts receivable and inventories 
these negative factors were partially offset by a production driven increase in accounts payable  increased compensation and benefit accruals  and favorable changes in deferred taxes 
collections of accounts receivable remained strong throughout the year  and we believe our recorded accounts receivable valuation allowances at the end of fiscal are adequate to cover the risk of potential bad debts 
allowances for non collectible accounts receivable  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled   and percent at the end of fiscal years   and  respectively 
the reduction in these percentages over this time period was driven by an overall improvement in the quality of our accounts receivable aging 
included in operating cash flows are cash contributions made to our employee pension plans which totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
for further information regarding the company s pension plans  refer to note restructuring related cash payments  which are also included in operating cash flows  totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
refer to note for further information regarding the company s restructuring activities 
cash flow investing activities capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal and million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in spending over the prior year primarily relates to new product development initiatives and the construction of our new office and showroom facility in the united kingdom 
at the end of fiscal  we had outstanding commitments for future capital purchases of approximately million 
we expect full year capital expenditures in to total between million and million 
a large portion of the planned increase over the current year is for expected spending related to our national design center in atlanta  the startup of our operation in mainland china  and tooling related to our recent product launches 
as previously discussed  we sold two wholly owned contract furniture dealerships during the first quarter of fiscal proceeds received in connection with these sales  which had the effect of increasing cash flows from investing activities  totaled million 
net cash received from the repayment of notes receivable in fiscal was primarily driven by a payment received from a contract dealership previously consolidated under fin r 
as mentioned earlier in this report  this vie was able to obtain financing with an outside bank and  therefore  was able to repay a large portion of its debt owed to us during the first quarter of fiscal at the end of fiscal  we reclassified assets with a net carrying value of million to current assets held for sale 
these assets related to a warehouse storage facility in west michigan that we had previously exited 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  the sale of these assets was finalized 
in connection with the sale  we received proceeds totaling million 
in the first quarter of fiscal  cash flows from investing activities included a payment totaling million related to the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of a contract furniture dealership based in oklahoma 
this acquisition is discussed further in note cash outflows for investing activities in fiscal included capital expenditures of million 
we also received proceeds totaling million related to the sale of our holland  michigan  chair plant facility during fiscal cash flow financing activities in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired cost of shares acquired average cost per share acquired shares issued average price per share issued cash dividends dividends paid per share share repurchases were the most significant factor affecting cash outflows from financing activities during the past three fiscal years 
our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of million in the third quarter of fiscal consequently  at the end of fiscal  we had million available for future share repurchases 
dividend payments during fiscal totaled million as compared to million last year 
during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors also approved a percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend 
the new quarterly cash dividend of per share was effective with the dividend payment in april interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal of million decreased million from million at the end of fiscal the majority of this decline was due to a scheduled million payment we made during the fourth quarter of fiscal on our private placement notes 
our next scheduled debt repayment of million on our private placement notes is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining reduction in debt represents the decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap arrangements during fiscal the combined fair values of the interest rate swap arrangements  as further described in note  was negative million at the end of fiscal  compared to a negligible amount at the end of the prior fiscal year 
the fair values of these swap arrangements change based on fluctuations in market interest rates 
such changes are not included in net earnings for the period 
instead  they are reflected as adjustments to our consolidated assets and or liabilities 
at the end of fiscal  the portion of our total interest bearing debt that was effectively converted to a variable rate basis through our swap arrangements totaled million 
the impact on interest expense due to the swap arrangements resulted in an interest expense addition of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal and  the impact on interest expense due to the swap arrangements resulted in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we paid off million of notes payable associated with one of the vie s initially consolidated under fin r as further described in note the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal years and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
the provisions of our private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require that we adhere to certain covenant restrictions and maintain certain performance ratios 
we were in compliance with all such restrictions and performance ratios again this quarter and expect to remain in compliance in the future 

table of contents partially offsetting the effects of our share repurchases  dividend payments  and debt payments during the period was cash received related to stock based benefit plans 
during fiscal  we received million from the issuance of shares in connection with these plans  net of million tax 
by comparison  we received million  net of million tax  from the issuance of shares in fiscal in fiscal  we received million  net of million tax from the issuance of shares 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs 
contingencies as previously reported  the company received a subpoena from the new york attorney general s office requesting certain information relating to the minimum advertised price program maintained by the herman miller for the home division 
in connection with this matter  the new york attorney general s office has taken depositions of current and former employees of the company and certain dealers 
the company and the new york attorney general s office have had preliminary discussions regarding possible methods of resolving the matter 
the company has reserved its best estimate of a potential amount to resolve this matter 
the accrued amount is not material to the company s consolidated financial position 
the company leases a facility in the uk under an agreement that expires in january under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term 
the company has estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is estimated that these costs will most likely approximate million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liability reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of june   and may  in may  the company assigned its rights as lessee of a uk facility to a third party under an agreement that contained a provision granting the third party the right to re assign the lease to the company after years  at its election 
during the first quarter of  the company was notified by the third party that it is no longer using the space and intends to exercise the re assignment option 
the original lease term expires in may the company believes it will be able to assign or sublet the lease for the majority of the remaining lease term to another tenant at current market rates 
however  current market rates for comparable office space are lower than the rental payments owed under the lease agreement 
as such  the company would remain liable to pay the difference 
as a result  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal for the expected loss under the arrangement based on the best information available at the time 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company revised its estimate of the time required to find a tenant 
this resulted in an additional pre tax charge during the third quarter of million 
the corresponding impact on our full year net earnings was million  net of a million tax benefit  or approximately per diluted share 
it is currently estimated that the present value of the future cost to the company under the arrangement will most likely approximate million  which is reflected as a liability within other liabilities as of june  we are also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is our opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to may fiscal  the year ended june   contains weeks while the years ended may   and may   contained weeks 
this is the basis upon which all of the above weekly average data is presented 
the extra week in fiscal is required approximately every six years in order to realign our fiscal calendar end dates with the actual calendar months 

table of contents contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods

purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension funding commitments are defined as the expected minimum funding requirements and planned voluntary contributions to be made in the following month period 
as of june   the total accumulated benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities on occasion  we provide financial support to certain independent dealers in the form of term loans  lines of credit  and or loan guarantees which may represent variable interests in such entities 
at june   we were not considered the primary beneficiary of any such dealer relationships under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
refer to note for further information on vie related transactions 
the risks and rewards associated with our interests in these other dealerships are primarily limited to our outstanding loans and guarantee amounts 
as of june   our maximum exposure to potential losses related to financing provided to these other entities totaled million 
information on our exposure related to outstanding loan guarantees provided to such entities is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we attempt to report our financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or to owned dealers  revenue is recognized once the product and services are delivered and installation is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates 
receivable allowances we base our allowances related to receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves could be required 

table of contents the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at june  and may   respectively 
this year over year reduction is attributable to the overall improvement in the quality of our accounts receivable aging 
goodwill the net carrying value of our goodwill assets at june   totaled million 
we account for our goodwill assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
under this accounting guidance  we are required to perform an annual test on our goodwill assets  by reporting unit  to determine whether the asset values are impaired 
if impairment is determined  we are required to recognize a charge sufficient to reduce the net carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
our impairment testing model is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
in completing the test under this approach  we assume that the value of a business today is derived from the cash flow it will generate in the future 
we also assume that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect our best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows may differ significantly 
the results of this test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  indicated that our net goodwill asset values were not impaired 
we employed a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
by this  we mean the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what we believe a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to our reporting units 
we believe the discount rates selected in our testing are conservative in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in the discount rates 
our testing as of june   indicates that a substantial increase in the discount rates utilized would be required before the results would indicate a potential impairment issue 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuations of such reserves are based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and result in an adjustment to our reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
we also have foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 

table of contents self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we establish reserves for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on actuarially determined expected future claims 
we also establish reserves for health benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
we also maintain insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
we utilize the services of an independent actuarial firm to analyze and recommend an appropriate rate 
for our domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a bond matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to various corporate bond portfolios with similar cash flow durations 
we set the discount rate for our international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate  which takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations  is based on a recommendation from our independent actuarial consultant 
the discount rates selected for our domestic pension and post retirement benefit plans at the end of fiscal were higher than those established at the end of fiscal with all other assumptions and values held constant  this change would result in a decrease in our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses for our fiscal year  which began on june  conversely  the discount rate selected for our international pension plan at the end of the current year was lower than the rate established at the end of fiscal this change would result in an increase in our international pension plan expense for fiscal if all other assumptions were held constant 
interest crediting rate we use this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant s account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
we base this methodology on the historical spread between the us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is appropriate 
expected long term rate of return we base this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
we consider risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents our long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an unrecognized actuarial loss is 
table of contents generated 
conversely  an unrecognized actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of june   and may   the net unrecognized actuarial loss associated with our employee retirement plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
in both periods  the majority of this unrecognized loss was associated with less than expected plan asset returns 
for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  we use a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  we recognize the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a large portion of our net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
we currently estimate this period to be approximately years 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  the deferred net actuarial loss ie  the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired businesses for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation we view stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain of our employees and non employee directors 
we account for these plans  which include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  employee stock purchase  and stock options  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb 
under this guidance we recognize compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock and stock units 
for stock options issuances  we do not recognize compensation expense when the stock options are granted to employees and directors at or above fair market value as of the grant date 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 we have been disclosing in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the pro forma impact on net earnings and earnings per share had we recognized expense related to stock option based compensation 
these pro forma disclosures require us to estimate a fair value for each stock option issued 
in completing this valuation  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model that requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of our common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
certain assumptions affecting stock based compensation are described below 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of our common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
for purposes of determining our pro forma footnote disclosure in fiscal year  we have assumed an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
for fiscal year  we assumed average expected option lives of between and years in calculating our pro forma footnote disclosure 

table of contents refer to notes   and for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans as well as the effective date of new accounting guidance that will require us to recognize compensation expense on grants of stock options beginning with our fiscal year 
new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that fixed production overhead expenses be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  as such  the company is required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal year the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
under sfas r  a public entity generally is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with such cost recognized over the applicable vesting period 
this new accounting treatment is also required for any share based payments to the company s board of directors 
sfas r also requires an entity to provide certain disclosures in order to assist in understanding the nature of share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
registrants are required to adopt sfas r no later than the beginning of the fiscal year beginning after june  as such  the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas r at the beginning of fiscal the company plans to adopt this new method of accounting using the modified prospective method  as defined within the transition provisions of sfas r  and to continue using the black scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options 
factoring in the impact of adopting sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  it is estimated that the company will recognize total pre tax compensation expense of approximately million during fiscal associated with the company s stock based awards 
this compares to pre tax stock based compensation expense of million recognized in fiscal further information regarding the pro forma earnings effect of the company s stock based awards for fiscal is provided in note the company continues to evaluate the impact that the implementation guidance and provisions included in sfas r will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under fin  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
any uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value 
the provisions of fin are required to be applied no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december   although early adoption is encouraged 
as such  the company adopted the provisions of fin at the end of fiscal the adoption of fin did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp addresses the accounting and disclosure for other than temporary impairments of investments  essentially endorsing existing guidance with certain modifications 
the guidance in the fsp is required to be applied to fiscal periods beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted 
as such  the company adopted the provisions of this fsp effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of the fsp did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
under fin  the tax effects of a position should be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
fin also requires significant new annual disclosures in the notes to the financial statements 
the effect of adjustments at adoption should be recorded directly to beginning retaining earnings in the period of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle 
retroactive application is prohibited under fin the guidance in fin is required to be applied to fiscal years beginning after december  as such  the company is required to adopt fin at the beginning of fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin on its consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management s belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  the types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  the success of the transition to our new executive management team  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in this form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastic textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
the market price of steel was relatively stable during fiscal and  in fact  improved slightly relative to the prior year 
consequently  it did not have a significant impact on the year over year gross margin comparison between fiscal years and during fiscal  however  the price of steel increased significantly 
as a result  the company estimates its direct material costs for steel components in fiscal increased between million and million in comparison to fiscal the market price of plastics and textiles are sensitive to the cost of oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices increased sharply during the latter half of fiscal and throughout fiscal as a result  the cost of plastics and textiles increased during this time period 
in addition to the market dynamics of supply and demand  the cost of wood particleboard has been impacted by continual downsizing of production capacity in the wood market as well as increased costs in transportation related to oil increases 
aluminum component prices have risen in part due to high market demand and increased energy costs associated with the conversion of raw materials to aluminum ingots 
the company believes future market price increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company manufactures its products in the united states and the united kingdom 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company s completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company s reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company s competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  and mexican peso 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into a forward currency instrument in order to offset million of its euro net asset exposure that is denominated in a non functional currency 
the forward currency instrument is marked to market at the end of the period  with changes in fair value reflected in net earnings 
at june   the fair value of the forward currency instrument was negligible 
at may   the company had no outstanding derivative financial instruments resulting from foreign currency hedge contracts 
gains arising from remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency  which were included in net earnings  totaled million  million  and million for the years ended june   may   and may   respectively 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar reduced the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity by million  million  and million for the years ended june   may   and may   respectively 

table of contents interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an incentive to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it 
the company has two separate interest rate swap instruments that  as of the end of fiscal year  effectively convert million in total of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instruments are held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
they are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these swap instruments are large financial institutions that the company believes are of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by these counterparties  such losses are not anticipated 
the combined fair market value of effective swap instruments was negative million at june   in comparison to a negligible amount at may  the impact on interest expense due to such swap instruments resulted in an addition to interest expense of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal and  the impact on interest expense due to the swap instruments resulted in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively 
all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as of june   the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt was approximately percent 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding as of that date  a percentage point increase in the weighted average interest rate would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows 
in millions thereafter total long term debt fixed rate wtd 
average interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay variable receive fixed pay interest rate at june  received interest rate pay variable receive fixed pay interest rate at june  receive interest rate amount does not include the recorded fair value of the swap instruments  which totaled negative million at the end of fiscal
