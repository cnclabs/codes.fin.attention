the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the footnotes to the financial statements included in this report on k 
the estimates used by management are based upon our historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of our operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventories our inventories  predominately comprised of finished goods  are generally valued at the lower of cost weighted average or market 
costs include amounts paid to suppliers for packaged apparel and or materials and labor  import costs  such as customs duties  freight in and other miscellaneous costs  and allocated overhead 
since we implemented our operations software in january  programming and human errors discovered within the system caused us to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting with respect to inventory valuation 
this weakness in our internal controls prevented us from relying upon the system recorded transactions with respect to inventory valuations during and we used a standard cost method to value our finished goods inventories from the fiscal quarter ended march   through the fiscal quarter ended march  had we been able to rely upon the system to properly compute the cost of our finished goods inventories using the weighted average method  we believe that the weighted average method would not have yielded a materially different computation of the value than the standard cost method that we applied 
based upon extensive tests that we performed near the end of fiscal  we believe that the material weakness in our internal controls has been eradicated 
we believe that the computer software has now been properly programmed  and employees have been adequately trained to utilize the system procedures  to rely upon the software to accurately compute our finished goods inventory valuations using a weighted average cost assumption 
we also believe that the system has been configured and employees are sufficiently monitored to ensure that all errors  sufficient to cause a material weakness with regard to the costing of our finished goods inventories  are unlikely to recur 
excess fashion apparel finished goods inventories are a natural component of a seasonal apparel business 
while certain fashion apparel items will sell out in any particular selling season  quantities of other fashion apparel items will remain at the end of each selling season 
we market previous seasons fashion apparel finished goods inventories at reduced wholesale prices to our customers in the normal course of business 
remaining excess inventories are liquidated through other markets 
in the ordinary course of business  we maintain reserves for inventory write downs due to the obsolescence of discontinued or aging merchandise 
we perform analyses on a quarterly basis to identify unsold discontinued or aging merchandise and adjust our reserves for inventory obsolescence to reduce the carrying value of discontinued or aging merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
the net realizable value of the discontinued or aging merchandise is estimated based on management s disposition plans and historical experiences 
generally  branded apparel inventories are not prone to impairment  because we usually order branded apparel in exact quantities to sufficiently satisfy specific customer orders 
however  branded apparel inventories remained on hand at june   because we shipped the father s day order in june  five weeks later than requested by wal mart 
due to the tardiness of that shipment wal mart canceled the follow up order  the apparel inventories for which we had already received  and we wrote the corresponding inventories down to the value that we expected to recover from selling the goods to another market 
during fiscal  we recorded fashion apparel inventories write downs of  including a write down of  during the fourth fiscal quarter  and we recorded branded apparel write downs of  during the fourth fiscal quarter 
while management believes that our processes produce fair valuations of obsolete inventories  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional allowances may be required 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
our significant deferred tax assets are related to net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes  stock based compensation and an unrealized loss for tax purposes on a common stock investment 
governing regulations require that our operating losses be carried forward for income tax purposes 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
the estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require us to exercise complex judgments 
we periodically review and adjust those estimates based upon the most current information available 
in accordance with sfas and based upon a review at june   of our utilization of deferred tax assets  we maintained a valuation allowance that effectively reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero 
while we continue to explore various strategies to return the company to profitability  including sales of top flite branded apparel to wal mart in fiscal  we cannot be certain that our efforts will result in the generation of future profits 
because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results  actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces our customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible 
estimating the credit worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires us to exercise considerable judgment 
in estimating the reserve for uncollectible accounts  we consider factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
from time to time  we also identify delinquent customer accounts for which a specific reserve is required 
at june   our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  including a specific reserve of  with respect to the potential non recovery of a net amount due to reserve apparel from a former inventory supplier 
while we consider our processes to be adequate to effectively quantify our exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may result in recoverability of our doubtful accounts that differs materially from our estimates 
allowance for sales returns we record allowances for sales returns as net adjustments to customer accounts receivable 
when recording an allowance  the net method reduces customer accounts receivable and net sales by the estimated gross margin effect of the anticipated sales return 
generally  our selling terms preclude return of our products subsequent to the sale 
however  we have traditionally maintained limited programs that offer various customers the right to return certain fashion apparel items under predefined conditions  which we include as a component within our estimate of allowance for sales returns 
we review historical data and consider factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions and anticipated customer performance when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
at june   the company s allowance for sales returns was  significant changes in general economic or industry conditions may yield sales returns that differ materially from our estimates recent developments on september   sport haley entered into an agreement with explorer gear and explorer headgear  inc which was approved by reserve apparel  for the purchase of explorer gear s membership interest in reserve apparel and to settle any potential claims between the parties 
the agreement requires sport haley to make a lump sum payment to explorer gear of  after reserve apparel began operations  certain disputes arose between the members concerning  among others  the formation  operation and performance of reserve apparel 
sport haley  reserve apparel  explorer gear and explorer headgear  inc have denied any liability to one another 
as part of the agreement  the parties have agreed to settle and resolve any asserted or potential claims against each other 
the parties have also agreed to mutual releases of all claims asserted  or which could have been asserted  against each other  and each party has continued to deny the merits of those claims asserted against it by the other 
upon entering into the agreement  explorer gear no longer owned any membership interest in reserve apparel  which became a wholly owed subsidiary of sport haley 
after the operations of reserve apparel were moved to our denver  colorado facility  reserve apparel designed a new line of top flite apparel  under the direction of sport haley management 
the new top flite line  consisting of basic and fancy collections of garments comprised primarily of a variety of performance fabrics  was presented to wal mart buyers in early september however  in late september  reserve apparel was notified that wal mart had chosen to develop its own brand of golf apparel rather than to continue purchasing our top flite line 
we expect to develop other markets and channels of distribution for our top flite apparel collections  including marketing the newly designed top flite line to other mass retailers 
as previously reported  a canadian apparel broker  which had handled several deliveries of top flite apparel to reserve apparel  applied a  prepayment to satisfy a debt of explorer headgear  inc a canadian company related to explorer gear by common ownership  management and employees instead of applying the amount as a deposit toward the production of finished goods inventories which were planned to be provided to reserve apparel by the canadian broker 
the  deposit had been advanced to the canadian broker by sport haley as a payment on behalf of reserve apparel and was recorded by sport haley as a member loan to reserve apparel 
at june   the  was included as an other receivable on the books of reserve apparel 
we believe that the canadian broker inappropriately misapplied the  deposit and have demanded repayment from the broker 
during may and june  we received certain assurances from the canadian broker that this matter would be resolved to our satisfaction 
however  to date  there has been no resolution to this matter 
also as previously reported  an executive from explorer gear informed the management of reserve apparel that the amount of  which was previously purported by explorer gear to have been paid to the canadian broker on behalf of reserve apparel  had not been paid 
at june   the  was included in the accrued liabilities of reserve apparel 
in june  reserve apparel discovered that the canadian broker had been paid twice for the same delivery of top flite apparel to reserve apparel  in the amount of  further  in august  because the canadian broker did not meet wal mart s extended deadline for receipt of the merchandise  wal mart canceled their order relating to the merchandise being provided by the canadian broker  which otherwise would have been shipped to wal mart in august consequently  reserve apparel canceled the purchase order with the canadian broker  which was approximately in the amount of  we do not believe that reserve apparel is liable for payment to the canadian broker with regard to the delinquent goods which wal mart would not accept 
however  since it is our understanding that the merchandise was in production when wal mart canceled their order  we cannot give any assurances that the canadian broker will not assert that reserve apparel is responsible for paying for these goods 
as of the date of this report  we did not have any pending orders with the canadian broker  and we do not anticipate placing any orders with the canadian broker for future delivery of top flite or any other apparel 
we expect to make further demands for repayment from the canadian broker for the  deposit and the  overpayment  and  if we cannot reach an amicable resolution of this matter with the canadian broker in the near future  we expect to initiate legal proceedings to recover the funds 
while we expect to aggressively pursue full recovery from the canadian broker  because of the relative ages of the misapplied deposit and overpayment and the nature of our severed relationship with the canadian broker  we recorded an allowance of  at june   with regard to the net amount due from the canadian broker 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from our statements of income for its fiscal years ended june   and  and fiscal year ended june  and consolidated net sales cost of goods sold gross profit other operating costs loss from operations other income and expenses  net loss from operations before minority interest in subsidiary loss and provision for benefit from income taxes minority interest in subsidiary loss provision for benefit from income taxes net loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and total net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  as compared with sales of  for fiscal net sales of fashion apparel for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  as compared with fashion apparel sales of  for fiscal net sales of branded apparel for fiscal were  for fiscal  net sales of ben hogan apparel collections were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal  and net sales of sport haley apparel collections were  for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  for fiscal in fiscal  we began marketing top flite apparel exclusively to wal mart  and net sales of top flite branded apparel were  for fiscal we began shipping top flite branded apparel to wal mart in march the market for women s golf apparel appears to have been shrinking for the past couple of years  which has caused fierce competition among the brands vying for limited shelf space within the market 
while we are certainly disappointed with the continued decrease in sales of our women s fashion apparel collections  we believe that the shrinking market may have bottomed out  and we anticipate that our sales of women s apparel will begin to increase slightly in future periods 
sport haley continues to be a highly recognized brand within the women s apparel market  and we are continuing to develop plans to improve the strategic position of the sport haley brand within the women s market 
because net sales of ben hogan apparel collections appear to have begun to flatten out  we implemented initiatives in fiscal to bolster our overall fashion apparel sales 
in fiscal  we hired a western regional sales manager who has extensive experience within the golf apparel industry in the western geographical regions of the united states and hawaii 
we believe that the western regional manager complements the talents of our eastern regional manager  who has a similar amount of experience within the golf apparel industry in the eastern geographical regions of the united states 
our regional sales managers are responsible for maximizing our fashion apparel sales within their respective geographical regions by training and supervising our independent wholesale sales representatives and maintaining contacts with key accounts 
in fiscal  we also hired a customer service liaison with extensive marketing experience within the golf apparel industry to provide white glove service to our key accounts and to help us market our sport haley and ben hogan fashion apparel brands to prestigious country clubs and resorts which have not done business with us in the past 
ben hogan apparel and top flite apparel are marketed in accordance with a license agreement we maintain with callaway  which we consider to be a key component of our overall business strategies 
while we have consistently exceeded the minimum calendar year sales requirements of the agreement with respect to ben hogan apparel while maintaining a strong working relationship with callaway  our trend of continuing increases in sales of licensed apparel sustains the risk of loss should the license agreement with callaway be terminated by either party 
gross profit for fiscal was  an increase of  or  as compared with gross profit for fiscal of  the difference between the fiscal years was partially attributable to lower write downs of fashion apparel inventories in fiscal as compared with fiscal write downs of fashion apparel inventories negatively impacted our gross margins by  in fiscal as compared with write downs of  in fiscal the difference between the fiscal years was also partially attributable to consolidating sales of fashion apparel with sales of branded apparel in fiscal gross profit for fiscal with regard to sales of branded apparel was  which yielded a gross margin on branded apparel net sales for the respective period 
we expect that our sales of top flite branded apparel should yield gross margins of or greater 
gross profit relating to top flite branded apparel sales for fiscal was negatively impacted by production delays  extraordinary shipping charges and mark down money due to wal mart 
production delays caused us to incur inbound freight charges of  because the top flite merchandise was continually received late from our suppliers  wal mart required that we ship the orders directly to each store rather than to respective wal mart distribution centers as originally planned 
we estimate that additional shipping costs  incurred to ship orders directly to wal mart stores rather than to distribution centers  were in excess of  for fiscal periodically  per our vendor agreement  wal mart may request that we reimburse them for mark downs they have taken or plan to take on top flite apparel we have sold to them 
it is our understanding that wal mart typically requests mark down money when sales of merchandise do not reasonably meet their internal expectations 
because we shipped top flite apparel for a father s day promotion five weeks late due to production delays  wal mart lost early sales opportunities for the merchandise  and sell through of the top flite apparel produced for that promotion did not reasonably meet their expectations 
we recorded sales discounts of  in fiscal relating to mark down concessions granted to wal mart with respect to the father s day promotion that adversely affected our gross profit  accordingly 
by june   we consolidated the operations of reserve apparel to move substantially all of its operations to our denver  colorado facility 
before moving the operations to denver  the product development  sourcing  logistics and sales invoicing operations of reserve apparel had been performed in toronto  ontario  canada  by employees of explorer gear  the minority interest 
by consolidating the operations of reserve apparel into our denver operations  and utilizing suppliers other than those which caused repeated production delays  we expect to improve the management of the entire production process and to achieve more reasonable margins on sales of top flite branded apparel in future periods 
since wal mart recently informed us that they do not intend to purchase top flite branded apparel in the near future  we will begin exploring other markets and channels of distribution for our top flite garments  including marketing top flite apparel to mass retailers other than wal mart 
gross margin for fiscal was  an increase of  from in fiscal our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies within the golf apparel industry 
we have consistently included the cost of merchandise sold  including import charges  in bound freight  allocated overhead  freight out  embroidery costs and other charges in our cost of goods sold 
our overhead allocation includes our production costs plus a portion of our distribution costs  such as receiving and inspection costs  but we include some of the other costs of distribution  such as a portion of our warehousing and other handling costs  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our gross margins also include  on a consolidated basis  the operations of reserve apparel  which distributes top flite branded apparel to the mass retail market at much lower price points and gross margins than those expected to be achieved in the premium and mid price markets where we distribute our sport haley and ben hogan fashion apparel brands 
other companies within the golf apparel industry may or may not operate within the lower price markets 
we include royalty payments  relating to sales of licensed apparel  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to various factors 
included in fiscal expenses were severance and other compensation expenses paid to our late chairman and former chief executive officer 
subsequent to the death of our chairman in september  we paid  in severance and other compensation to the late chairman s estate 
similarly  upon the departure of our former chief executive officer in october  we accrued  in severance and other compensation that is generally payable to the former executive over a three year period ending in march the severance and other compensation amounts paid to our late chairman and former chief executive officer increased our selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal by  the severance and other compensation expense paid to our former chief executive officer had no effect on our selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal salary and other payroll related expenses  net of severance and other compensation costs  totaled  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from  in fiscal we attribute the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses to our continued efforts to streamline our operations and to find additional ways to decrease our overall operating expenses 
as a percentage of sales  our selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
royalty expense for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  for fiscal the increase in royalty expense was primarily attributable to the introduction of top flite branded apparel in fiscal royalty expense is due to callaway in accordance with the license agreement they previously granted to us to market golf apparel bearing the ben hogan and top flite labels 
total other income  net  for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal our other income  net  is generally comprised of interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances held at various financial institutions 
the increase in other income  net  was primarily attributable to higher rates of interest earned during fiscal as compared with fiscal other income for fiscal also includes  of the  recovered in the settlement we reached with our former auditors 
we offset legal expenses for fiscal with the remainder of the settlement in the amount of  loss from operations before minority interest in subsidiary loss and provision for income taxes for fiscal was  an improvement of  or  from a loss of  in fiscal while a substantial amount of the improvement was due to the factors discussed above  such as better controls over fashion apparel inventories that resulted in lower write downs of obsolete or discontinued inventories in fiscal  severance and other compensation expense incurred in fiscal and not in fiscal  lower overall payroll and related expenses in fiscal  higher rates of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents in fiscal and the settlement recovery from our former auditors in fiscal  we believe that the improvement is also indicative of management s concerted efforts to return the company to profitability 
of the  loss incurred in fiscal  only  related to the operations of sport haley  as compared with  in fiscal the remaining  of the  fiscal loss was attributable to the operations of reserve apparel 
basic and diluted losses per share were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
due to the net losses for the respective periods  all outstanding options were anti dilutive and therefore excluded from the loss per share calculations 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal were  an increase of  or  as compared with net sales of  for fiscal we attributed the difference in net sales to factors such as the continued growth in sales of ben hogan apparel collections offset by the discontinuance of our haley reserve men s fashion apparel and a continued decrease in sales of sport haley women s fashion apparel 
for fiscal  our net sales of ben hogan apparel collections were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the increase in net sales between the fiscal years is indicative of the growth we achieved with our ben hogan collections within the premium priced golf apparel market 
as previously reported  we discontinued our haley reserve men s fashion apparel beginning with our spring selling season  in part because of its diminishing sales and in part because we had expected to introduce top flite branded apparel in its place within our distribution channels 
we began shipping our spring apparel collections during november we believe that the discontinuance of our haley reserve men s fashion apparel negatively impacted our fiscal sales by at least  the total of our net sales for such apparel during our spring selling season 
historically  sales within our haley branded apparel lines have been disproportionately comprised of greater sales of women s apparel than of men s apparel 
overall  net sales of our haley branded apparel decreased by  or  from net sales of  for fiscal to net sales of  for fiscal the continued decline in sales of our sport haley women s fashion apparel appeared to be related to a shrinking market for women s golf apparel  because our customers appeared to be placing less importance on women s fashion golf apparel within their shops 
in fiscal  we consolidated our network of independent wholesale sales representatives to allow our most of our representatives to market both our sport haley women s collections and our ben hogan men s collections simultaneously 
for fiscal  ben hogan branded apparel revenues accounted for  haley branded apparel revenues accounted for and embroidering and shipping revenues accounted for of our net sales  respectively 
comparatively  for fiscal  ben hogan branded apparel revenues accounted for  haley branded apparel revenues accounted for and embroidering and shipping revenues accounted for of our net sales  respectively 
gross profit for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the difference in gross profit between the fiscal years was primarily attributable to the following factors i during fiscal  we revised our procedures used to assess the recoverability of our finished goods inventories by using an improved method that calculates the estimated sales value based upon the quantities and mix of inventories that are expected to remain at the end of the selling season  rather than an estimate based upon the total number of units on hand that we used previously 
using the new recoverability assessment method  the net effect of inventory write downs negatively impacted our gross profit for fiscal by  comparatively  in fiscal  inventory write downs negatively impacted our gross profit by  ii in fiscal  we disposed of a significant portion of our excess finished goods inventories relating to our fall and prior selling seasons 
in december  we sold substantially all of our discontinued or aging finished goods inventories from the spring and earlier selling seasons to a major retailer 
while we had previously estimated the recoverability of those inventories  we recognized an additional loss of  upon their disposition in december iii as previously reported  in conjunction with performing procedures recommended by the developer of our software that were designed to correct a prior system malfunction  we performed a physical count of our finished goods inventories and performed a detailed review of our component inventories at december  the physical inventory caused us to reduce the value of our finished goods inventories by  and the detailed review caused us to reduce the value of our component inventories by  at december  the reductions in value similarly increased our cost of goods sold at december   thereby negatively impacting our gross profit for the period 
gross margin for fiscal was  a decrease of  from in fiscal our gross margins may not have been comparable to other companies within the golf apparel industry 
we consistently included the cost of merchandise sold  including import charges  in bound freight  allocated overhead and other charges  custom embroidery costs and freight out in our cost of goods sold 
amounts invoiced to our customers for custom embroidery as well as shipping and handling charges were included as components of our net sales 
our overhead allocation included certain of our distribution costs  such as receiving  inspection and shipping costs  but we included some of the other costs of distribution  such as a portion of our warehousing and other handling costs  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we included royalty payments  relating to sales of licensed apparel  in other operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal the increase between fiscal years was due to a combination of several separate factors 
subsequent to the death of our chairman in september  we paid  in severance and other compensation expense to the late chairman s estate 
similarly  upon the departure of our former chief executive officer in october  we accrued  in severance and other compensation that is generally payable to the former executive over a three year period ending in march the death of our former chairman and the departure of our former chief executive officer contributed to a decrease in our total salary and other payroll expenses for fiscal salary and other payroll expenses  net of severance costs  totaled  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from  in fiscal as we previously reported  near the end of december  we performed a detailed analysis of the individual categories of our selling  general and administrative expenses  and we used our evaluation as a tool to streamline our operations further 
as a percentage of sales  our selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
royalty expense for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  for fiscal the increase in royalty expense between the fiscal years was directly related to the increase in net sales of our ben hogan apparel collections 
total other income  net  for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the difference between the fiscal years in the amounts of and the rates of interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during fiscal  interest rates earned on our near risk free investments improved slightly over the nearly all time lows earned on such investments in fiscal cash equivalents and marketable securities were purchased from time to time in accordance with guidelines  which our board of directors previously approved  designed to maximize the rates of return achieved on near risk free investment balances 
loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was  a difference of  or  from  for fiscal net loss for fiscal was  a difference of  or  from  for fiscal the proportional disparity between the difference in losses from operations before provision for income taxes and the difference in net loss arose because of the differences in the financial statement effects of our valuations with respect to net deferred tax assets between the fiscal years 
the valuation of net deferred taxes between years may cause variations in effective tax rates that can vary significantly due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement purposes versus the methods for recognizing those transactions for tax purposes within the same fiscal period 
certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes and certain deductions for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial statement purposes within the same fiscal year 
for fiscal  our provision for income taxes was  primarily because we increased a valuation allowance to effectively reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero 
we periodically review and adjust our valuation for deferred tax assets based upon the most current information available 
because of our trend of net losses in the and most recent prior years  we believed that it was more probable than not that none of our deferred tax assets would be recovered  and  in fiscal  we maintained the valuation allowance that effectively reduced our deferred tax assets to zero 
income tax expense for the period equaled taxes payable for the period plus the change during the period in our net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal and  we paid  and in applicable federal and state income taxes  respectively 
basic and diluted losses per share were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
due to the net losses for the respective fiscal years  all outstanding options were anti dilutive and therefore excluded from the loss per share calculations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are derived from our available cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and a working capital line of credit with a commercial bank 
we require cash for our general working capital purposes 
we do not anticipate requiring material amounts of cash for capital expenditures over the next months 
to the extent our cash balance is insufficient to finance our working capital needs  we may also make periodic borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
our working capital requirements are highly seasonal in nature  with greater requirements from approximately august through october and february through april of each fiscal year due to the purchases of fashion apparel inventories for the spring summer and fall holiday selling seasons  respectively 
working capital was  and  at june  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities totaled  and  at june  and  respectively 
for purposes of the statements of cash flows  we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present an insignificant risk of change in value due to changes in interest rates  to be cash equivalents 
net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary components of adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash provided by used in operating activities were changes between fiscal years relating to impairments and write downs  deferred taxes  provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns  accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable  and accrued commissions and other expenses 
adjustments for impairments and write downs affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the effects on net cash provided by used in operating activities caused by impairments and write downs represent the expense effects of recording impairments and write downs in the respective fiscal years 
because of the seasonal nature of the fashion apparel business  excess inventories left over at the end of each selling season previous seasons inventories are common within the industry 
throughout each fiscal year  we market previous seasons inventories through our ordinary marketing channels 
at or near the end of each fiscal quarter  we identify and revalue obsolete inventories  primarily consisting of previous seasons fashion apparel inventories  to estimated disposition values 
write down charges relating to excess inventories have adversely affected our earnings and cash flows for the last several years 
in fiscal  we enacted initiatives directed to significantly reduce the levels of finished goods inventories in order to minimize the future adverse financial effects associated with the devaluation of obsolete fashion apparel inventories 
in fiscal  we sold a significant portion of our previous seasons fashion apparel inventories and refined our procedures to better estimate the recoverability our finished goods inventories  and we established new procedures for purchasing fashion apparel inventories designed to minimize the quantities expected to remain at the end of each selling season 
in   of the  inventory write down related to branded apparel inventories on hand at june  generally  branded apparel inventories are not prone to impairment  because we usually order branded apparel in exact quantities to sufficiently satisfy specific customer orders 
branded apparel inventories remained on hand at june   because we shipped the father s day order in june  five weeks later than requested by wal mart 
due to the lateness of that shipment wal mart canceled the follow up order  the apparel inventories for which we had already received  and we wrote the corresponding inventories down to the value that we expected to recover from selling the goods to another market 
the effects on net cash provided by operating activities caused by changes in deferred taxes primarily represent the change in expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
our significant deferred tax assets are related to net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes  stock based compensation and an unrealized loss for tax purposes on a common stock investment 
governing regulations require that our operating losses be carried forward for income tax purposes 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
the estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require us to exercise complex judgments 
we periodically review and adjust those estimates based upon the most current information available 
in accordance with sfas and based upon reviews at june   and  of our utilization of deferred tax assets  we maintained a valuation allowance that effectively reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero 
while we continue to explore various strategies to return the company to profitability  including the introduction of top flite branded apparel  we cannot be certain that our efforts will result in the generation of future profits 
because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results  actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates 
deferred taxes affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by in fiscal  in fiscal and  in fiscal the effects on net cash provided by operating activities caused by changes in provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns primarily represent the net expense effects of the changes in allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns between the respective years
