under the installment method  the company recognizes income on sales of vacation ownership interests only when the company receives cash either in the form of a down payment  as an installment payment or from proceeds from the sale of the customer note 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest may be imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the related tax is paid 
if the company is otherwise not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year

customer defaults have a significant impact on cash available to the company from financing customer notes receivables  in that notes which are more than to days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  the company in effect must repay borrowings against such notes or buy back such notes if they were sold with recourse 
on april  effective january   the company formed the ilx resorts incorporated employee stock ownership plan and trust the esop 
the intent of the esop is to provide a retirement program for employees that aligns their interests with those of the company

no contribution was made in and during the year ended december   the company made contributions of  which were used to purchase  common shares

such borrowings are not expected to exceed  credit facilities and capital at december   the company has an agreement with a financial institution for a commitment of million under which the company may sell certain of its customer notes 
the agreement provides for sales on a recourse basis with a purchase rate of prime plus 
customer notes may be sold at discounts or premiums to the principal amount in order to yield the purchase rate  with the premium held back by the financial institution as additional collateral 
at december   million of the million commitment was available to the company 
the company also has a financing commitment for million whereby the company may borrow against notes receivable pledged as collateral 
these borrowings bear interest at a rate of prime plus 
the million commitment was amended in february and  under the amended agreement  the borrowing period expires in and the maturity is in at december   approximately million is available under this commitment

in  the company deannexed  studio vacation ownership interests and annexed into premiere vacation club one bedroom and two bedroom vacation ownership interests 
this property was acquired through the assumption of an existing mortgage which does not provide for release provisions 
in order to facilitate the registration  the company secured a guaranty commitment from one of its lenders  opened an escrow account and makes monthly release payments 
the balance of this escrow account of  at december  is included in other assets 
in may and april  the company amended an existing construction loan to secure an additional million and million  respectively  in construction financing for projects and to pay off an existing note 
in august  the company amended the same construction loan to provide for an additional million in construction financing for development of units on its land in pinetop  arizona and to payoff an existing first mortgage on the property

the note bears interest at prime plus  paid monthly  with monthly principal payments of per annual premiere vacation club sale and per biennial premiere vacation club sale 
in the future  the company may negotiate additional credit facilities  including leases  issue corporate debt  issue equity securities  or any combination of the above 
any debt incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  may bear interest at fixed or variable rates of interest  and may be subject to such terms as management deems prudent 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional corporate debt or equity at or beyond current levels or that the company will be able to maintain its current level of debt 
the company believes available borrowing capacity  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity  operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents the company s contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of december  the company also sells consumer notes with recourse 
the company has no other significant contractual obligations or commercial commitments either on or off balance sheet as of this date 
payments due by period contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total seasonality the company s revenues are moderately seasonal with the volume of ilx owners  hotel guests and vacation ownership interest exchange participants typically greatest in the second and third fiscal quarters 
as the company expands into new markets and geographic locations it may experience increased or additional seasonality dynamics which may cause the company s operating results to fluctuate 
inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenues  operating income and net income during any of the company s three most recent fiscal years 
however  to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be affected as well as the rates the company charges on its customer notes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company currently derives a portion of income from the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the interest rates at which it borrows against customer notes or at which it sells customer notes 
the company s indebtedness bears interest at variable rates while the retained customer notes bear interest at fixed rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could cause interest expense to exceed interest income on the company s portfolio of retained customer notes 
the company does not currently engage in interest rate hedging transactions 
therefore  any change in the prime interest rate could have a material effect on results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
if there were a one percentage point change in the prevailing prime rate at december   then based on the million balance of variable rate debt at december   interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately  before income taxes per annum
