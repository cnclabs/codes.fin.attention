application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized when the product is sold through to the end customer unless an established return history supports recognizing revenue upon shipment  less a provision for estimated sales returns 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue consists primarily of revenue from reseller arrangements and service revenue 
revenue derived from the development and installation of highly customized software packages under a professional services contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis measured by the relationship of hours worked to total estimated contract hours and the costs incurred as of the date of measurement 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends upon estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition and net income  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and net 
table of contents income 
if estimates were to indicate that a loss would be incurred on a contract upon completion  a provision for the expected loss would be recorded in the period in which the loss became evident 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts management is required to estimate the collectibility of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
management evaluates all accounts periodically and a reserve is established based on the best facts available to management and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
the reserves also are determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results 
allowance for returns the company estimates its allowance for returns based upon expected return rates 
the estimates of expected return rates are generally a factor of historical returns 
changes in return rates could impact allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in the past due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in this estimate may continue to occur in the future as market conditions change 
long lived assets property and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
all impairments are recognized in operating results when a permanent reduction in value occurs 
derivative financial instruments and hedging all derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because it conducts business on a global basis and in some cases in foreign currencies 
the company s operations in france are measured in the local currency and converted into us dollars based on 
table of contents published exchange rates for the periods reported and are therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the euro to us dollar translation accounted for charges of approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in an attempt to mitigate the risk described above  the company may enter into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
these derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedges under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and therefore any changes in the market value of these contracts are recognized as a gain or loss in the period of the change 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a loss of approximately  related to these foreign exchange contracts 
at december  the company had five foreign exchange contracts outstanding to acquire approximately million euros for each contract on specified dates during the next months 
there were no such contracts at december  market price risk the company has no equity hedge contracts outstanding as of december   or interest rate risk the company s investments are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
the company invests its cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds  and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and agencies 
due to the demand nature of the company s money market funds and the short term nature of the company s time deposits and debt securities portfolio  these assets are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk through investments with shorter term maturities and varying maturity dates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our marketable securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate decrease of less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  the company s credit facility  bears interest at a variable rate tied to the london interbank offered rate libor 
in an effort to mitigate interest rate fluctuations the company has  from time to time  locked in the rate with one year agreements 
the company is examining interest rate trends to determine if it would be beneficial to enter into an agreement to lock in the libor rate for a period longer than its current day period 
as of december   the libor rate was libor 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would increase annual interest expense on this credit facility by approximately
