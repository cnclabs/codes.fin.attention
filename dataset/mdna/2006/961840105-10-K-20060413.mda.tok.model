these statements are not guaranties of future performance and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 

table of contents actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
factors that could cause our actual performance  future results and actions to differ materially from any forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors below and discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our improvements in comparable store sales and operating results in fiscal may not be indicative of our future performance trends  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such rate of improvement and achieve profitability 
during fiscal and  the comparable store sales of our wet seal concept declined significantly  which resulted in a loss from continuing operations in both fiscal years 
in fiscal  comparable store sales of our company as a whole increased by  as compared to a decline during fiscal  resulting in a narrowed loss from continuing operations 
however  we can provide no assurance that comparable store sales increases will continue or that we will achieve profitability in the future 
our ability to maintain the success of our wet seal and arden b 
concepts depends in large part on a number of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including forecasting of demand and fashion trends  hiring of a full time chief merchant for the wet seal concept  providing an appropriate mix of appealing merchandise for our targeted customer base  managing inventory effectively  using effective pricing strategies  selecting effective marketing techniques  optimizing store performance  negotiating acceptable renewals of expiring leases and general economic conditions 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain the recent rate of improvement in results of operations in the future 
we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows in recent years 
we incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows during each of fiscal and which caused liquidity problems and resulted in very tight vendor payment terms 
in  we raised additional capital  generated a smaller operating loss and had positive cash flow from operations  which improved our liquidity substantially 
if  in the future  we were to experience operating losses and negative cash flows  resulting in renewed concern about our ability to pay vendors  we might need additional financing 
such financing would likely be very costly  and would potentially be unavailable  on reasonable terms 
the closing of certain wet seal stores may not significantly improve our future financial condition or results of operations 
in december  we announced that we would close approximately wet seal stores as part of our turn around strategy 
we completed our inventory liquidation sales and the closing of wet seal stores in march during fiscal  we also closed an additional nine wet seal stores  of which one was due to lease expiration  and closed five arden b 
stores  which were all due to lease expirations 
we also re opened eight previously closed wet seal stores during fiscal although the stores closed in had been underperforming as compared with our other wet seal stores  there is no assurance that in the long term these store closures will have a significant positive impact on our operating results or that we will not have to close additional stores in the future 
historically we have grown through opening new stores  however  due to our financial condition in the past three years we have not recently opened a significant number of additional stores and  while we are planning to open new stores this year  we cannot be certain that future store openings will be successful 
our company has historically expanded by opening new stores  remodeling existing stores and acquiring other store locations or businesses that complement and enhance our operations 
from time to time  we have 
table of contents created new retail concepts such as arden b 
while we plan to open to new wet seal and or arden b 
stores during fiscal  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in opening that number of stores or that such stores will be profitable 
we have had significant management changes over the last eighteen months and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy in the near term 
in general  our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management  particularly personnel engaged in merchandising and store operations  and on our ability to identify  hire and retain additional key management personnel 
in november  the chairman and chief executive officer and the president of our wet seal concept resigned from our company 
in december and january  we appointed a new president and chief executive officer and four members to our board of directors 
in august  our executive vice president and chief financial officer resigned from our company  and was replaced by a new executive vice president and chief financial officer in december on march   two new members joined our board of directors 
effective march   the president of our arden b 
concept resigned and was replaced by a new president of merchandise for the arden b 
concept on march  we are also in the process of recruiting a chief merchant for the wet seal concept 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience a transition period as this new management team is fully integrated 
due to the intense competition for qualified personnel in the retail apparel industry  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  hire or retain key personnel with the merchandising and management skills necessary to consistently offer appealing products to our target market 
we need to employ personnel with the requisite merchandising skills to continue our merchandising strategy implemented by mr 
gold 
michael gold  a well regarded retailer  has assisted our company with our recent merchandising initiatives 
under the direction of mr 
gold  our wet seal concept introduced and implemented a new merchandising strategy to attract teenage girls to our stores 
on july   we entered into an agreement with mr 
gold to confirm his continuing services as a consultant to our company and to secure his services until january  although our agreement with mr 
gold provides him with significant financial incentives that he would forfeit if he terminates his agreement with us before january   if mr 
gold terminates his agreement and he elects not to continue his relationship with our company  or if we do not agree with mr 
gold to extend his consulting agreement beyond january and are unable to employ personnel with similar merchandising skills by that time  our results of operations may be significantly and adversely impacted 
our company has been a defendant in a class action and the subject of an investigation by the securities and exchange commission 
as previously reported  our company and certain of our former directors and former officers have been named as defendants in several securities class actions filed on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock between january   and august  these actions have been consolidated in the united states district court for the central district of california 
the consolidated complaint alleged violations of section b of the exchange act and rule b promulgated thereunder  and section a of the exchange act by  among other allegations  making false and misleading statements concerning the progress of our company to stem the losses of our wet seal concept and return that business to profitability as well as the illegal use of material non public information by former directors and a company controlled by them 
the plaintiff sought class certification  compensatory damages  interest  costs and attorneys fees and expenses 

table of contents on september   the consolidated class action was dismissed against all defendants in the lawsuit 
however  plaintiffs were granted leave to file an amended complaint  which they did file on november  we filed an additional motion to dismiss the amended complaint  and it is anticipated that the motion will be argued this year 
in the event plaintiffs achieve a favorable outcome  and even though we have insurance coverage for such claims  significant damages could be assessed against our company that exceed available insurance coverage  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our company and our results of operations 
in february  we announced that the securities and exchange commission had commenced an informal  non public inquiry regarding our company 
we indicated that the securities and exchange commission s inquiry generally related to the events and announcements regarding our company s second quarter earnings and the sale of class a common stock by la senza corporation and its affiliates during on april   the securities and exchange commission advised us that it issued a formal order of investigation in connection with its review of matters relating to our company 
consistent with the previous announcement  we intend to cooperate fully with the securities and exchange commission s inquiry 
to date we have complied with the securities and exchange commission s requests by providing to them relevant documentation and written responses to their questions 
it is too soon to determine whether the outcome of this inquiry will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations 
the issuance of restricted shares under our stock incentive plan has resulted in and will result in substantial dilution of our earnings per share  significant charges to our company and volatility in our operating results 
in january  we established our stock incentive plan to attract and retain directors  officers  employees and consultants  which  as amended  reserves  shares of class a common stock for issuance 
as of january   an aggregate of  shares of restricted class a common stock had been granted to joel n 
waller  the chief executive officer  gary white  our executive vice president of wet seal  john j 
luttrell  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  michael gold and our non employee directors 
a total of  of these shares have vested as of april   and are fully transferable by the holders 
as a result of our granting of restricted shares  we have incurred and will continue to incur non cash compensation charges to our earnings over the vesting periods or when the restrictions lapse  which has had and will continue to have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and on our earnings per share 
in addition  the non cash compensation charges for certain of the restricted shares are based on our common stock price on the vesting date for such shares  which could result in significant volatility in the amount of such charges 
our reported earnings and earnings per share will be significantly impacted as a result of the issuance of the securities in the january and may private placements and their subsequent conversion or exercise 
as a result of our issuance of the securities in the january and may private placements  as discussed further in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report  and in accordance with accounting guidelines noted in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  eitf issue no 
 application of eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  to certain convertible instruments and accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants  we determined the fair market value of the warrants as well as the value of the beneficial conversion features associated with our secured convertible notes 
the value assigned to our warrants and the beneficial conversion features reduced the face values of our secured convertible notes  resulting in a discount that will be amortized over the life of our secured convertible notes 
the amortization of the discount will result in significant non cash charges and will have an adverse effect on our earnings and earnings per share 

table of contents prior to the conversion or the exercise of the securities in the january private placement and the warrants issued in the may private placement  the shares of class a common stock underlying these securities will be included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share  provided their inclusion is not anti dilutive 
prior to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock issued in the may private placement  the shares of class a common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock will be included in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share  provided their inclusion is not anti dilutive 
in addition  although the holders of these securities may not convert or exercise the respective securities if they would own together with any of their respective affiliates more than of class a common stock  upon such conversion and or exercise  as applicable  our basic and diluted earnings per share would be affected by the inclusion of the underlying shares of class a common stock in our per share calculations 
also  since a majority of our secured convertible notes remained outstanding as of the end of fiscal  interest expense  whether amortized  capitalized or paid  including acceleration of discount and deferred financing cost amortization and reversal of accrued interest upon conversions of secured convertible notes  will have a significant impact on our financial results 
covenants contained in agreements governing our existing indebtedness restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our secured convertible notes contain covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business 
subject to certain exceptions  these covenants restrict  among other things  our ability  and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries  to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the lines of credit 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends and or if there is a decrease in the demand for fashionable  casual apparel  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 
these factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes for our products  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
this risk is particularly acute because we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our sales also depend upon the continued demand by our customers for fashionable  casual apparel 
demand for our merchandise could be negatively affected by shifts in consumer discretionary spending to other goods  such as electronic equipment  computers and music 
if the demand for apparel and related merchandise were to decline  our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected by any resulting decline in sales 

table of contents our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location  in store environment and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b 
stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  bebe  and bcbg 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in a narrowly defined market segment  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target demographic  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  and pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value 
in addition to the competitive challenges specified above  many of our competitors are large national chains  which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do and which may be better able to adapt to changing conditions that affect the competitive market 
also  our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  although we believe that we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls  competition for prime locations and lease terms within shopping malls  in particular  is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new locations or maintain our existing locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b 
which are registered in the retail store services class and pending in others 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  we cannot assure you that others will not imitate our products or infringe on our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or non registered marks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business is affected by local  regional and national economic conditions 
our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns and preferences 
various economic conditions affect the level of spending on the merchandise we offer  including general business conditions  interest rates  taxation  the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
our growth  sales and profitability may be adversely affected by unfavorable occurrences in these economic conditions on a local  regional or national level 
we are especially affected by economic conditions in california  where approximately of our stores are located 

table of contents further  the majority of our stores are located in regional shopping malls 
we derive sales  in part  from the high volume of traffic in these malls 
the inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  or the decline in popularity of malls as shopping destinations  would reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is seasonal in nature  and any decrease in our sales or margins during these periods could have a material adverse effect on our company 
the retail apparel industry is highly seasonal 
we generate our highest levels of sales during the christmas season  which begins the week of thanksgiving and ends the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends the first week of september 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on the sales generated during these peak periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods  whether as a result of economic conditions  poor weather or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
we depend upon key vendors to supply us with merchandise for our stores  and the failure of these vendors to provide this merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our ability to purchase current season apparel in sufficient quantities at competitive prices 
the inability or failure of our key vendors to supply us with adequate quantities of desired merchandise  the loss of one or more key vendors or a material change in our current purchase terms could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by causing us to experience excess inventories and higher markdowns 
we have no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities or on terms acceptable to us in the future  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon a single distribution center  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the distribution functions for all of our stores are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a portion of our products is manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a 
table of contents number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the united states government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies and or restrictions on the transfer of funds between the united states and foreign jurisdictions  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
our imports are limited by textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign jurisdictions  including hong kong  china  taiwan and south korea 
these agreements impose quotas on the amounts and types of merchandise that may be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements also allow the united states to limit the importation of categories of merchandise that are not now subject to specified limits 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room or space under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
as part of our commitment to human rights  we require our domestic and foreign suppliers to abide by a code of conduct for vendors and suppliers  which sets forth guidelines for acceptable factory policies and procedures regarding workplace conditions  including wages and benefits  health and safety  working hours  working age  environmental conditions and ethical and legal matters 
if one of our suppliers fails to comply with this code  we may be required to discontinue our relationship with that supplier  which could result in a shortfall in our inventory levels 
further  if the supplier s non compliance were publicly disclosed  our customers may refuse to purchase our products 
either of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we experience business risks as a result of our internet concept 
we compete with internet concepts that handle similar lines of merchandise 
these competitors have certain advantages  including the inapplicability of sales tax and the absence of retail real estate and related costs 
as a result  increased internet sales by our competitors could result in increased price competition and decreased margins 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including reliance on third party computer and hardware providers  diversion of sales from our retail stores  and online security breaches and or credit card fraud 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet concept could adversely affect the profitability of our internet concept 
our involvement in lawsuits  both now and in the future  could negatively impact our business 
we are currently a defendant in a class action lawsuit  and we have been involved in a variety of other legal proceedings in the past 
although we intend to vigorously defend the claims against us  if any of the claims in 
table of contents these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are resolved unfavorably to us  we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or pursue alternative business strategies 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our defense of these actions has resulted  and may continue to result  in substantial costs to us as well as require the significant dedication of management resources 
if we choose to settle any of these lawsuits  the settlement costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash resources and financial condition 
risks related to our class a common stock our stockholders may experience additional dilution due to previous private placements of convertible securities 
since may  we have completed private placements which are potentially very dilutive to our stockholders 
in june  as part of our private placement of equity securities to institutional and other accredited investors  we issued warrants to acquire  shares of class a common stock 
the warrants issued in this private placement may be adjusted from time to time for stock splits  stock dividends  distributions and similar transactions 
as of january   no warrants issued in this private placement have been exercised for shares of class a common stock 
in january  we issued our convertible notes which were convertible initially into an aggregate amount of  shares of class a common stock and warrants which were initially exercisable into  shares of class a common stock 
the conversion and exercise prices of the these securities have full ratchet anti dilution protection  which means the conversion or exercise price  as the case may be  will be adjusted from time to time subject to certain exceptions in the event of the issuance of shares of class a common stock or of securities convertible or exercisable into shares of class a common stock  at prices below the applicable conversion or exercise price 
on may   a portion of the warrants issued in the january private placement were exercised for  shares of class a common stock 
as of january   convertible notes issued in this private placement have been converted into  shares of class a common stock and warrants issued in this private placement  including the warrants exercised on may   have been exercised into  shares of class a common stock 
in may  we issued shares of preferred stock which are initially convertible into  shares of class a common stock and warrants which are initially exercisable into  shares of class a common stock 
the shares of preferred stock have customary weighted average anti dilution protection as well as anti dilution protection for stock splits  stock dividends and distributions and similar transactions 
alternatively  the warrants will only be adjusted from time to time for stock splits  stock dividends  distributions and similar transactions 
as of january   shares of preferred stock issued in this private placement have been converted into  shares of class a common stock and warrants issued in this private placement have been exercised into  shares of class a common stock 
although certain conversion and exercise restrictions are placed upon the holders of the securities issued in the january private placement and the securities issued in the may private placement  the issuance of the additional shares of class a common stock will cause our existing stockholders to experience significant dilution in their investment in our company 
in addition  if the cash liquidity issues described elsewhere in these risk factors require us to obtain additional financing involving the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  our existing stockholders investments would be further diluted 
such dilution could cause the market price of class a common stock to decline  which could impair our ability to raise additional financing 
the price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past few years and may fluctuate significantly in the future  which may make it difficult for you to resell the shares of our class a common stock 
our class a common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq national market  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of 
table of contents class a common stock 
the market price of class a common stock is likely to fluctuate  both because of actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the market price of class a common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  the addition or loss of suppliers  customers and other business relationships  changes in financial estimates of  and recommendations by  securities analysts  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of class a common stock  general market and economic conditions  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of class a common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance 
our class a common stock could be subject to short selling and other hedging techniques and  if this occurs  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
in general  class a common stock could be subject to a number of hedging transactions including the practice of short selling 
short selling  or shorting  occurs when stock is sold which is not owned directly by the seller  instead  the stock is loaned for the sale by a broker dealer to someone who shorts the stock 
in most situations  this is a short term strategy by a seller  and based upon volume  may at times drive stock values down 
based upon a review of the current stock ownership filings made by our stockholders with the securities and exchange commission  we have identified several investment firms that own equity interests in our company 
these firms may actively engage in hedging transactions  including the short selling of class a common stock from time to time 
moreover  a significant percentage of the convertible securities issued in our private placement transactions are held by investment firms who may engage in such transactions 
any such hedging activities could reduce the value of our current stockholders equity interests in our company at and after the time the hedging transactions have occurred 
we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to do so in the future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders and the indenture governing our notes prohibit us from paying dividends to our stockholders 
investors who anticipate the need for dividends from investments should not purchase our class a common stock 
our charter provisions  shareholder rights plan and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of class a common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
in addition  under certain circumstances our board of directors may grant rights to our stockholders under our shareholder rights plan 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy 
table of contents contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock  the granting of rights to stockholders under our shareholder rights plan and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of class a common stock 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have not received written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the commission that were issued days or more preceding the end of fiscal that remain unresolved 
item properties our principal executive offices are located at burbank  foothill ranch  california  with  square feet of leased office and distribution facility space  including  square feet of merchandise handling and storage space in the distribution facility and  square feet of office space 
this lease expires on december  the lease grants our company one five year renewal option 
we lease all of our stores 
lease terms for our stores typically are years 
the leases generally provide for a fixed minimum rental and additional rental based on a percentage of sales once a minimum sales level has been reached 
certain leases include cash reimbursements received from landlords for leasehold improvements and other cash payments received from landlords as lease incentives 
when a lease expires  we generally renew that lease at current market terms 
however  each renewal is based upon an analysis of the individual store s profitability and sales potential 
due to poor performance and or non renewal of a lease  we closed wet seal stores and arden b 
stores during the year ended january  of these closures  were due to lease expirations and were related to our previously announced plans to close wet seal stores or to identification of additional wet seal stores to close due to their poor performance 
at the end of fiscal  we had  square feet of leased space for continuing operations  not including our principal executive offices 
the following table sets forth information with respect to store openings and closings since fiscal fiscal years stores open at beginning of year stores acquired during the year stores opened during the year stores closed during the year stores open at end of year we acquired zutopia stores on march   from gymboree  inc includes re opening of eight previously closed wet seal stores 
includes the closure of zutopia stores 
item legal proceedings between august   and october   six securities class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the central district of california  or the court  on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock between january   and august  we and certain of our former directors and 
table of contents executives were named as defendants 
the complaints allege violations of sections b and a of the exchange act  and rule b of the exchange act  on the grounds that  among other things  we failed to disclose and misrepresented material adverse facts that were known to us or disregarded by us 
on november   the court consolidated the actions and appointed lead plaintiffs and counsel 
on january   the lead plaintiffs filed their consolidated class action complaint with the court  which consolidated all of the previously reported class actions 
the consolidated complaint alleges that we violated the federal securities laws by making material misstatements of fact or failing to disclose material facts during the class period  from march to august  concerning our prospects to stem ongoing losses in our wet seal concept and return that business to profitability 
the consolidated complaint also alleges that our former directors and la senza corporation  a canadian company controlled by them  unlawfully utilized material non public information in connection with the sale of our common stock by la senza 
the consolidated complaint seeks class certification  compensatory damages  interest  costs  attorney s fees and injunctive relief 
we filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint in april on september   the consolidated class action was dismissed against us in the lawsuit 
however  plaintiffs were granted leave to file an amended complaint  which they did file on november  we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on january   and a court hearing is scheduled for june  there can be no assurance that this litigation will be resolved in a favorable manner 
we are vigorously defending this litigation and are unable to predict the likely outcome in this matter and whether such outcome may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
accordingly  no provision for a loss contingency has been accrued at january  on february   we announced that the commission had commenced an informal  non public inquiry regarding our company 
we indicated that the commission s inquiry generally related to the events and announcements regarding our second quarter earnings and the sale of our stock by la senza corporation and its affiliates during the commission has advised us that on april   it issued a formal order of investigation in connection with its review of matters relating to our company

executive overview we are a national specialty retailer operating stores selling fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers 
we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
at january   we had retail stores in states  puerto rico and washington dc of the stores  there were wet seal stores and arden b 
stores 
we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or expansion relocation 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on certain expenses such as store payroll  store occupancy  depreciation  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are at least partially fixed 
positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating leverage on expenses while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash  and working capital 
transaction counts we consider the trend in the number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores that more than offsets any decrease in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 
gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically initial markups and markdowns  buying costs  planning and allocation costs  distribution costs  and store occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a significant increase in our use of markdowns or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating income loss we view operating income loss as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income loss are comparable store sales  gross margins  and our ability to control operating costs 
for a discussion of the changes in the components comprising operating income loss  see results of operations in this section 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
we expect that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance operations without borrowing under our senior credit facility for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  stock based compensation  recovery of deferred income taxes  and insurance reserves 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail store locations 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
additionally  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified as revenue 
online concept customers typically receive goods within five to seven days of being shipped 
we have recorded reserves to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
a customer may return merchandise within days of the original purchase date 
actual return rates have historically been within management s estimates and the reserves established 
as the reserve for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the reserve  which could impact sales 
we recognize the sales from gift cards and gift certificates and the issuance of store credits as they are redeemed 
through our wet seal concept  we have a frequent buyer program that entitles the customer to receive a to discount on all purchases made during the twelve month program period 
the revenue from the annual membership fee of is non refundable 
membership fee revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the twelve month membership period  which approximates the spending pattern under the program 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the frequent buyer program are recognized at the time of such purchases 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
we introduced a customer loyalty program in our arden b 
concept in august under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed at any time for merchandise 
merchandise redemptions are accrued as unearned revenue and recorded as a reduction of sales as points are accumulated by the customer 
the program has been in effect for only eighteen months  resulting in our having limited history for assessing redemption patterns 
however  we have anticipated partial non redemption of awards based on the program s redemption history to date 
the unearned revenue for this customer loyalty program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at january   and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect sales 

table of contents merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value  then is converted to a cost basis by applying an average cost factor that represents the average cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns on a cost basis in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented   and of sales  respectively 
we accrued on a cost basis for planned but unexecuted markdowns as of january   and january   of million and million  respectively 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
long lived assets in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  with such estimated fair values determined using the best information available  generally the discounted estimated future cash flows of the assets using a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during fiscal  we determined such events or changes in circumstances had occurred with respect to certain of our retail stores  and that operating losses would likely continue 
as such  we recorded non cash charges of a combined total of million in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal to write down the carrying value of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
as of july   based on disappointing sales results during the fiscal back to school period  the then expectation of continued operating losses through the end of fiscal and our historical operating performance  we concluded that an indication of impairment existed at july   with respect to a large number of our retail stores 
accordingly  we conducted an impairment evaluation as of july  
table of contents additionally  as the operating losses continued through the end of the fiscal year and the holiday season  we determined that a triggering event occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter and accordingly updated the impairment analysis 
based on the results of these analyses  we wrote down the carrying value of certain impaired long lived assets during fiscal by million  including impairment of goodwill see below 
the impairment charges were a non cash charge to our consolidated statements of operations 
the estimation of future cash flows from operating activities requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance 
if our sales growth  gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level  or cost inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our retail stores may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment annually as of january   and also on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not impairment may have occurred 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other retail businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use assumptions for items such as comparable store sales  store count growth rates  the rate of inflation and the discount rate we consider to represent our weighted average cost of capital and or the market discount rate for acquisitions of retail businesses 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of our goodwill may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
as of january   goodwill was million  of which the entire amount is directly associated with the arden b 
concept 
based on the january   analysis  we determined that no impairment of the company s goodwill had occurred 
however  based on the results of the january   analysis  we wrote down the carrying value of goodwill as of january   by million  which was recorded within asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation we have various stock based compensation arrangements that provide options  warrants  restricted stock grants and performance shares to certain employees  non employee directors  consultants  lenders and landlords 
through fiscal  we have elected to account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which utilizes the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
for certain of our stock based compensation arrangements  we also apply other accounting guidance  including eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  eitf issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods and services  and eitf issue no 
 accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report on form k  during the first quarter of fiscal  we will begin to account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in our incurring approximately million in stock based compensation expense in fiscal that would not have been incurred under apb no 
this estimate is based upon various assumptions  including an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be granted  cancelled or expired during fiscal  as 
table of contents well as future stock prices 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in these assumptions would materially affect our estimates 
in addition  our net income will continue to be reduced by compensation expense for share based awards to non employees 
the application of these accounting standards may require initial valuations and periodic re valuations of the equity instruments we have issued as stock based compensation 
these initial valuations and re valuations may require consideration of our then common stock price and estimates that include future common stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and anticipated annual dividends 
in fiscal  and  we recognized stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
if our class a common stock price fluctuates or the assumptions we use to value such equity instruments change  we may record charges or credits  which may be significant  to increase or decrease the amount of expense recognized for stock based compensation 
recovery of deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a result of disappointing sales results during the back to school season and our historical operating performance  management concluded that it was more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of this conclusion  we reduced to zero our net deferred tax assets by establishing a tax valuation allowance of million in fiscal in addition  we have discontinued recognizing income tax benefits in the consolidated statements of operations until it is determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
as of january   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  which begin to expire in section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of net operating loss carryforwards to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on net operating loss carryforwards occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
based on our analysis  we had an ownership change on april   which results in section limitations applying to federal net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to that date  which we estimate to be approximately million 
however  we estimate we will have approximately million of pre ownership change federal net operating loss carryforward available within five years after the ownership change  at a rate of approximately million annually  with the residual approximate million becoming available prior to expiration between and however  if future taxable income were to exceed the sum of i the applicable annual loss limitation  ii carryforwards of prior years unutilized losses  if any  and iii carryforwards of post ownership change losses  if any  in any given fiscal year  then we would be required to pay federal and state income taxes on the excess amount in such fiscal year 
we estimate we will have approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income in fiscal however  we may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable  of which only may be offset by alternative minimum tax net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to net operating loss carryforward utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards in some states altogether  which could result in our incurring additional state income taxes 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our worker s compensation and group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an 
table of contents aggregate annual liability of million 
under our group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of the insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as the actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
current trends and outlook in january  we initiated the primary component of our turn around strategy for our wet seal stores 
this approach  among other things  consisted of lower retail prices  a broader assortment of fashion right merchandise and more frequent delivery of fresh merchandise 
with the introduction of this new strategy  we experienced consolidated comparable store sales growth of in fiscal this comparable store sales trend has resulted primarily from increased transaction counts  partially offset by a decrease in average dollar sale 
as a result of our improving sales trend and the completion of our wet seal concept store closure plan  we experienced a significant reduction in our loss from continuing operations in fiscal versus a year ago 
gross margin expanded to of sales in fiscal versus for the prior year  driven by the improving sales in existing stores  lower merchandise markdowns and the benefits of closing low volume stores 
our current operating performance trend and financing transactions completed in fiscal and have resulted in increased liquidity and  in turn  improved our current credit standing with suppliers  which may further improve our liquidity 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not experience future declines in comparable store sales 
if our comparable store sales drop significantly  this could impact our operating cash flow and we may be forced to seek alternatives to address cash constraints  including seeking additional debt and or equity financing 
store closures in december  we announced that we would close approximately wet seal stores as part of our turn around strategy 
we completed our inventory liquidation sales and the closing of wet seal stores in march during fiscal  we also closed an additional nine wet seal stores  of which one was due to lease expiration  and closed five arden b 
stores  which were all due to lease expirations 
we believe future closures for at least the next twelve months will primarily be the result of lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
during fiscal  we took net charges of million related to the estimated lease termination costs for the store closures that occurred in our fiscal quarter ended april   and related liquidation fees and expenses  partially offset by a benefit related to the write off of deferred rent associated with these stores 
issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants to further enhance our financial position and provide sufficient capital to finance our efforts of improving our performance  we announced on april   the signing of a securities purchase agreement with several investors that participated in our january private placement financing 
on may   we completed this financing and received approximately million in net proceeds including the proceeds from the exercise of the series a and series b warrants discussed below and after the retirement of our million bridge loan and related accrued interest and before transaction costs 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement  the investors agreed to exercise all of their outstanding series a warrants and a pro rata portion of the outstanding series b warrants that were issued in the january financing see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we issued approximately million shares of our class a common stock related to the exercise of these warrants at an aggregate exercise price of approximately million 
at the closing  we issued to the investors  shares of our series c convertible preferred stock  or the preferred stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the preferred stock is convertible into 
table of contents million shares of our class a common stock  reflecting an initial per share conversion price 
the preferred stock is not entitled to any special dividend payments  mandatory redemption or voting rights 
the preferred stock has customary weighted average anti dilution protection for future stock issuances below the applicable per share conversion price 
we also issued series e warrants to purchase up to million shares of our class a common stock 
the series e warrants became exercisable on november   and expire on november  the series e warrants have an initial exercise price of  reflecting the closing bid price of our class a common stock on the business day immediately before the signing of the securities purchase agreement 
the series e warrants have anti dilution protection for stock splits  stock dividends  distributions and similar transactions 
we used approximately million of the proceeds from the financing to retire our outstanding bridge loan  which was provided by certain participants of the january financing 
the remainder of the proceeds  approximately million  is being used for general working capital purposes and costs of the transaction 
as described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  based on valuations of the series e warrants  the registration rights agreement associated with the preferred stock and the beneficial conversion feature of the preferred stock  we recorded the preferred stock at a discount of approximately million  with such discount also recorded as an increase to paid in capital 
because the preferred stock is immediately convertible and has no stated redemption date  we recognized the million discount on the preferred stock as a non cash deemed dividend in its entirety on may  the non cash dividend is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to arrive at net loss attributable to common stockholders 
for the year ended january   investors in the preferred stock converted  shares of preferred stock into  shares of class a common stock  resulting in  shares of preferred stock remaining outstanding as of january  credit extensions due to our financial results through fiscal  we experienced a tight credit environment 
credit extended to us by vendors  factors  and others for merchandise and services was extremely limited 
this credit tightening required us to issue letters of credit outside of the ordinary course of business  or  in many instances  shorten vendor credit terms 
the lack of credit created a considerable need for working capital 
our improving sales trend  the completion of the may private placement and our improved operating results in fiscal have significantly improved our cash position and liquidity profile 
as a result  we believe  but cannot provide assurance  that we could now obtain longer credit terms with several vendors 
however  we continue to maintain shorter credit terms in order to take advantage of favorable purchase discounts 
arrangements with michael gold since late  michael gold has been assisting our company with merchandising initiatives for our wet seal concept 
on july   we entered into a consulting agreement and an associated stock award agreement with mr 
gold to compensate him for his part in our sales turn around and to provide incentives for his future assistance in achieving our return to profitability 
mr 
gold s consulting agreement extends through january  under the terms of the consulting agreement  we paid mr 
gold million upon execution and will pay him million per month from july through january we recorded million of consulting expense within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january   to recognize mr 
gold s cash compensation earned to date 
under the terms of the stock award agreement  we awarded mr 
gold million shares of non forfeitable restricted stock  which vested on january   and two tranches of performance shares  the performance shares  of million shares each 
the performance shares vest upon our achievement of certain common stock 
table of contents market price levels as specified in the stock award agreement 
the second tranche of performance shares may also vest upon our achievement of certain sales and gross margin levels  also as specified in the stock award agreement 
subsequent to january   the entire first tranche of the performance shares had vested due to our achievement of the specified common stock market price levels pertaining thereto 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we recorded million of non cash consulting expense within general and administrative expenses in fiscal for the value of the million shares of non forfeitable restricted stock as of the grant date  and we recorded million of non cash consulting expense within general and administrative expenses in fiscal based on the service period elapsed and the fair value of the performance shares  which included consideration of vesting probability as of january  prospectively  the performance shares will be accounted for on a variable basis  whereby quarterly charges through the remainder of the consulting agreement period will be based upon the then fair value of the performance shares  which could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
results of operations except as otherwise noted  the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations excludes our discontinued zutopia concept  which was closed by may the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year indicated 
the discussion that follows should be read in conjunction with the table below as a percentage of sales fiscal year fiscal year ended january  january  january  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses store closure costs asset impairment operating loss interest expense income  net loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss accretion of non cash dividends on convertible preferred stock net loss attributable to common stockholders fiscal compared to fiscal net sales change from prior fiscal year in millions net sales comparable store sales 
table of contents net sales in fiscal increased as a result of significant growth in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales increased as a result of an increase in transaction count per store  partially offset by a decrease in average dollar sale driven substantially all by a decrease in our average unit retail  which resulted from our change in merchandising strategy in our wet seal stores 
the sales growth from increased comparable store sales was partially offset by having a lower average number of stores in operation during fiscal than in fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from closing wet seal stores during the period from december through january and wet seal stores from february through early march pursuant to the wet seal turn around strategy 
the fewer stores in operation during fiscal versus fiscal was also affected by closure of stores primarily from february through september of fiscal and closure of an additional stores from late march through the end of fiscal the lower average number of stores in operation was partially offset by openings of stores during fiscal followed by openings of stores during fiscal  which included re openings of previously closed wet seal stores 
cost of sales change from prior fiscal year in millions cost of sales percent of net sales cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  markdowns  inventory shortages  inventory valuation adjustments  inbound freight  payroll expenses associated with design  buying  planning and allocation  inspection costs  processing  receiving and other warehouse costs  and rent and depreciation and amortization expense associated with our stores and distribution center 
cost of sales  in dollars and as a percent to sales  decreased due to the positive effect of higher average store sales on design  buying  planning and allocation and occupancy costs  significantly lower markdown volume  at cost of sales during fiscal versus of sales during fiscal  due primarily to benefits from the new merchandising approach in our wet seal stores  and the volume impact of having a lower average number of stores open in fiscal versus fiscal due mainly to the effect of the wet seal turn around strategy 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a change from prior fiscal year in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of net sales our sg a expenses are comprised of two components 
the selling expense component includes store and field support costs including personnel  advertising  and merchandise delivery costs as well as internet catalog processing costs 
the general and administrative expense component includes the cost of corporate functions such as executives  legal  finance and accounting  information systems  human resources  real estate and construction  loss prevention  and other centralized services 

table of contents selling expenses decreased million to of sales  or as a percentage of sales  from a year ago 
the decrease in store operating expenses from last year  in dollars  was primarily due to having a lower average number of stores open in fiscal versus fiscal due mainly to the effect of the wet seal turn around strategy  which resulted in an million decrease in store and field operations payroll and benefit costs  and a million decrease in spending for advertising  which included the discontinuance of our wet seal in store fashion and entertainment network  partially offset by increases of million for merchandise delivery  million for bags and boxes and million for store supplies as a result of our significant transaction count increase  and an increase of million in credit card fees due to our sales growth 
the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to efficiencies resulting from changes in our store staffing model and the leverage benefits on store labor from the comparable store sales increases in ongoing stores  partially offset by the increases in store supplies  bag and box and merchandise delivery costs  which exceeded our sales growth rate 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million over last year to million

as a result of our operating losses over the past three years  primarily those in fiscal and fiscal  we experienced a tightening of credit extended to us by vendors  factors  and others for merchandise and services 
the impact of this credit tightening required us to issue letters of credit outside of the ordinary course of business  or  in many instances  shorten vendor credit terms 
all of these factors led us to seek additional financing for the purpose of executing our turn around strategy  funding future negative cash flows from operations  satisfying working capital needs  funding capital expenditures in fiscal and improving our credit worthiness

we estimate that the adoption of sfas no

these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in these assumptions would materially affect our estimates 
in addition  our net income will continue to be reduced by compensation expense for share based awards to non employees and performance share and restricted stock grants to employees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to the extent that we borrow under the facility  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at january   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility  however we did have million outstanding under our junior secured term loan 
the junior secured term loan bears interest at the prime rate plus 
the balance of this note was repaid on march  based on the outstanding balance of the junior secured term loan at january   a one percent increase in the applicable interest rate would decrease our annual cash flow by million 
conversely  a one percent decrease in the applicable interest rate would increase our annual cash flow by million 
as of january   we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments  except as discussed in market risk change in value of our common stock immediately below 
market risk change in value of our common stock our notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k contain an embedded derivative  which upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined  allows each note holder the option to require us to redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to the greater of i the product of x the conversion amount being redeemed and y the quotient determined by dividing a the closing sale price of our class a common stock on the business day on which the first public announcement of such proposed change of control is made by b the conversion price and ii of the conversion amount being redeemed 
we account for this derivative at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other long term liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we determine the fair value of the derivative instrument each period using both the black scholes model and the monte carlo simulation model 
such models are complex and require significant judgments in the estimation of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices 
changes in the fair market value of the derivative liability are recognized in earnings 
in applying the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models  changes and volatility in our common stock price and risk free interest rates could significantly affect the fair value of this derivative instrument  which could then result in significant charges or credits to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended january   there was a million decrease in the fair value of this derivative  which we recognized as a decrease to the carrying value of the derivative liability and a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations
