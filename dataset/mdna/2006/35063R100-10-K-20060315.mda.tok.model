business environment over the last several years  the macro economic environment has gradually improved 
however  we experienced a sudden weakness in sales in the first quarter of due to a sluggish capital spending and heightened competitive pricing environment 
throughout the remainder of  the business and macro economic environment gradually improved as capital spending on it infrastructure and data networking equipment  in particular  also improved 
during  we experienced a continuation of a broad enterprise upgrade cycle  which began in  as customers continued preparing their network infrastructure for voice over internet protocol voip  wireless 
table of contents applications  and the adoption of gigabit ethernet in the network core to accommodate higher levels of network traffic 
the networking market has been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
our revenue has generally been favorably affected by increases in units sold as a result of market expansion  increases in market share and the release of new products 
however  our revenue growth has been hindered by declining prices and competitive pressures 
the market for data networking products continues to be dominated by cisco systems  inc  with over share of the networking market 
we continue to invest in our core market and adjacent markets in which the competitive landscape looks attractive and the growth prospects are promising 
although we expect our revenue to grow in  there can be no assurance that the networking market will continue to improve or that we will be successful in executing on our growth strategy 
financial performance marked our seventh consecutive year with net income since we went public in september our total net revenue for decreased slightly to million from million in due to a dramatic slowdown in the first quarter of in march  the networking market experienced a short  but sharp slowdown in enterprise spending 
our business recovered in april and we experienced consecutive revenue growth in the remaining quarters of net income in was million  or of total net revenue  compared to million  or of total net revenue  in a pre tax litigation settlement expense of million and related legal fees reduced our profitability in our balance sheet remains debt free  with cash and investments of million  an increase of million from during  we generated million of cash from operations and received million of cash from employee stock issuances 
on november   we accelerated the vesting of unvested out of the money stock options for approximately million shares held by employees and officers under our equity compensation plans 
for purposes of the acceleration  options with an exercise price greater than per share were deemed out of the money given our stock price of on november  the accelerated options  which are considered fully vested as of november   have exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the board of directors made the decision to immediately vest these options based in part on the issuance of sfas r 
absent the acceleration of these options  upon adoption of sfas r  we would have been required to recognize approximately million in pre tax compensation expense from these options over their remaining vesting terms as of december  we also believe that because the options that were accelerated had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of our common stock  the options were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  current economic conditions  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates that can have a 
table of contents significant effect on our results of operations and the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of foundry s board of directors 
these and other significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remainder of our revenue primarily coming from customer support fees 
we generally sell to direct end users and value added resellers 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller 
product revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment  unless an acceptance period or other contingency exists  in which case revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or upon satisfaction of the contingency 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support arrangement  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements eg  hardware and installation  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the arrangement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method as prescribed by eitf revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met for that unit of accounting 
the application of eitf involves significant judgment 
for example  we use judgment to determine whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered item s in an arrangement 
the timing of revenue recognition varies based on this determination 
at the time product revenue is recognized  we estimate the amount of warranty costs to be incurred and record the amount as a cost of revenue 
our standard warranty period extends one or five years from the date of sale for hardware  depending on the type of product purchased  and days for software 
our estimate of the amount necessary to settle warranty claims is based primarily on our past experience 
although we believe our estimate is adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  actual warranty costs could differ materially from our estimate 
if actual warranty costs are greater than initially estimated  our cost of revenue could increase in the future 
we also provide a provision for estimated customer returns at the time product revenue is recognized 
our provision is based primarily on historical sales returns and our return policies 
our resellers generally do not have a right of return  and our contracts with original equipment manufacturers only provide for rights of return in the event our products do not meet specifications or there is an epidemic failure  as defined in the contracts 
if historical data used by us to calculate estimated sales returns does not reasonably approximate future returns  revenue in future periods could be affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial condition and ability to pay based on credit rating services such as dun and bradstreet  and are generally assigned a credit limit that may be increased only after a successful collection history has been established 
we do not have significant billing or collection problems 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables and actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or significant deterioration in financial condition 
we estimate allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on factors such as current economic and industry trends  the extent to which receivables are past due  and historical collection experience 
if circumstances change  estimates regarding the collectibility of receivables would be adjusted 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring certain international 
table of contents customers to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees prior to placing an order with us 
although we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  our actual amount of bad debt could differ materially from our estimates 
inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
our inventory purchases and commitments are made based on anticipated demand for our products  as estimated by management  and our expected service requirements 
we perform an assessment of our inventory each quarter  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycles and development plans  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we estimate the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand and make adjustments to record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
once inventory has been written down to the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value  it is reflected on our balance sheet at its new carrying cost until it is sold or otherwise disposed 
we use contract manufacturers to assemble and test our products 
we also utilize third party oems to manufacture certain foundry branded products 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure an adequate supply of inventories  our agreements with some of these manufacturers allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based on rolling production forecasts provided by us 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by certain manufacturers in accordance with our forecasts although we can generally give notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
in addition  we issue purchase orders to our component suppliers that may not be cancelable at any time 
as of december   we had approximately million of open purchase orders with our component suppliers and third party manufacturers that may not be cancelable 
if actual demand for our products is below the level assumed in our production forecasts  we may have excess inventory or a liability as a result of our purchase commitments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
management assesses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized against projected future taxable income or our ability to generate taxable income from specific sources  and to the extent that realization is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
in the event we determine that we are unable to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would be necessary  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
our net deferred tax assets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies in the normal course of our business  in addition to those related to intellectual property and securities litigation 
a loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we continually reassess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  and will recognize a liability  if any  for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp addresses the 
table of contents determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this fsp to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r also amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that tax benefits from stock option exercises be classified as a financing activity  rather than an operating activity  on the statement of cash flows 
this requirement will reduce net cash flows from operating activities in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because this would depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  we have recognized million and million in and  respectively  in operating cash flows for the tax benefit from stock option exercises 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning on january  for calendar year companies 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period 
the compensation cost for that unvested portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas  as originally issued 
all new awards and awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date will be accounted for under the provisions of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but entities are allowed to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas we have adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
we expect adoption of sfas r to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation  on a pre tax basis  to be expensed in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million 
to the extent that we grant restricted stock and additional stock options to employees and directors  stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants 
in addition  our tax rate may fluctuate significantly between periods based on the extent of employee gains recognized on stock option exercises 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
the guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the additional paid in capital apic pool for the beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon our adoption of sfas r on january  in addition  this fsp addresses that when the alternative apic pool calculation is used  tax benefits related to certain employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within the statements of cash flows 
the fsp allows companies up to one year from the later of the adoption date of sfas r or november  to evaluate the available transition alternatives and make a one time election 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the new method provided by this guidance 
in june  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas fsp  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations  which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the directive  which was adopted by the european union eu 
under the directive  the waste management obligation for historical equipment products put on the market on or prior to august  sold to commercial users remains with the commercial user unless legislation adopted by the particular eu member country provides for the transfer of the obligation back to the producer 
the directive has not yet been implemented in every eu country and specific eu country requirements may vary 
fsp is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the directive s adoption 
table of contents into law by the applicable eu member countries in which the company has significant operations 
fsp does not address the accounting for the disposal of waste related to equipment put on the market after august  with respect to those eu member countries that had implemented the directive as of december   we have adopted fsp and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
with respect to those eu member countries that had not adopted legislation to implement the directive as of december   we do no expect the adoption of fsp to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
apb  accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of change a cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle while sfas requires retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas enhances the consistency of financial information between periods 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued fas no 
sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the types of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as inventory 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will be required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our results of operations 
results of operations net revenue we offer products in two configuration platforms  a fixed configuration stackable and a flexible configuration chassis 
a stackable has a fixed configuration that cannot be altered 
a chassis uses a modular platform that can be populated and reconfigured with various management and line card modules as frequently as desired by the customer 
for example  customers can use our chassis products at the edge of their network and then reconfigure the chassis to be used in the mission critical backbone or core of their network 
our selling prices and gross margins on chassis based products are generally higher than our stackable products because of the flexible configuration offered by chassis based products 
net revenue information is as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change of net of net of net to to revenue revenue revenue net revenue product service total net revenue chassis stackable total net revenue 
table of contents net product revenue in decreased from due to weaker than expected demand for networking equipment in the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we experienced a sudden decline in sales 
despite a recovery in the second quarter  product revenue decreased in the first half of  compared to the same period in we believe our customers became more cautious about their own business outlook towards the end of due to a number of factors  including lack of visibility into their own future results and concerns about their industry s growth prospects in during the remainder of  product sales gradually improved 
however  we continued to experience reductions in overall average selling prices  resulting from a change in product mix to lower priced stackable products and competitive pricing pressure 
revenue for reflects our first full year of sales of our lower priced gigabit ethernet fastiron edge stackable switches  which offer a similar feature set as our small end chassis but at a lower price point 
our gigabit stackable switches have gained strong customer acceptance and continue to increase as a percentage of our product revenue 
however  the cost of gigabit and gigabit ethernet in the industry has continued to drop and  as a result  we expect average selling prices to continue to decline 
stackable products generated of our total net revenue in  versus in sales to the us government represented of our total revenue in  down from in we believe the decrease was due to a realignment of spending priorities by the us federal government in net product revenue in decreased from as a result of lower average selling prices and a shift in sales mix to lower priced stackable products 
although the overall global economy improved in from  the pricing environment remained competitive 
as a result  we experienced an increase in overall port shipments of  but the decline in average selling prices and a shift to lower priced stackable products resulted in flat product revenue 
our sales volume increased primarily due to sales of our gigabit ethernet stackable products  which was introduced in the second quarter of and quickly gained customer acceptance 
sales to the us government represented of our total revenue in  down from in service revenue consists primarily of revenue from customer support contracts 
the increases in absolute dollars in and were due to a larger installed base of our networking equipment each year as customers purchased new support contracts with their new equipment purchases and renewed maintenance contracts on existing equipment 
in early  we increased our efforts to renew customers maintenance contracts on a timely basis 
as a result  support revenue increased significantly in our customer base grew from  customers at the end of  to  at the end of  and to  customers at the end of we manage our business based on four geographic regions the americas primarily the united states  europe  the middle east  and africa emea  japan  and asia pacific 
because some of our customers  such as the us federal government and multinational companies  span various geographic locations  we determine revenue by geographic region based on the billing location of the customer 
net product revenue by region as a percentage of net product revenue was as follows americas emea japan asia pacific net product sales in for each of the four regions remained unchanged from as a percentage of net product revenue 
the shift in product sales from japan to emea in was due to large deployments of our products in europe by the us government and several other large customers during  compared to large deployments of our products by major service providers in japan during for the years ended december  and  no customers accounted for or more of our net product revenue 
for the year ended december   two customers accounted for greater than of our net product revenue 
a reseller in japan  accounted for and a us government integrator represented of our net product revenue 

table of contents gross margins the following table presents gross margins and gross margin percentages for product and service revenue dollars in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross margin margin margin gross margins product service total gross margin our cost of product revenue consists primarily of materials  labor  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
product gross margins  as a percentage of product revenue  decreased in as a result of continued selling price erosion  increased inventory provisions  primarily as a result of a product transition  and a shift in product mix to lower priced stackable products 
during  we transitioned from our fourth generation jetcore based products to our fifth generation terabit capacity products  the bigiron rx and netiron xmr routers  and also introduced our fastiron superx gigabit ethernet switch 
as a result of the product transition  inventory provisions for our older products increased and average selling prices decreased as we discounted the older product lines 
product inventory provisions were million in  compared to million in our gross margins may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully manage the transition to newer products by minimizing disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoiding excessive levels of older product inventories  and providing sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands 
product gross margins in were higher than due to favorable product mix and lower contract manufacturing and component costs in  offset somewhat by continued selling price erosion in our cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing services under customer support contracts  including maintaining adequate spares inventory levels at service depots 
service costs include material costs  labor  and overhead 
service gross margins increased in primarily due to lower spares inventory provisions and favorable pricing variances on certain service inventory components in we expect service gross margins to experience variability over time due to the timing of technical support initiations and renewals  spares inventory levels  and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure 
our service gross margin percentage decreased in as a result of increased service inventory and labor costs associated with supporting a larger customer base and a broader product portfolio 
due to the expansion of our customer base throughout the world  we continued to increase our investment in our support infrastructure by opening more service facilities and supplying them with adequate spares inventory to support our increasingly broader product offerings 
our gross margins may be adversely affected by increased price competition  component shortages  increases in material or labor costs  excess and obsolete inventory charges  changes in channels of distribution  or customer  product and geographic mix 
see also risk factors our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 

table of contents operating expenses the following table presents research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change of net of net of net to to revenue revenue revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative litigation settlement  n a n a research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype materials  and expenses related to software development  testing costs  facilities  and the depreciation of property and equipment used in research and development activities 
research and development expenses increased million compared to primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses to retain and reward our engineers and  to a lesser extent  increased prototype costs to develop our new product series of high end internet and metro routers 
headcount in our engineering department increased slightly to engineers at the end of research and development expenses in increased million from due primarily to higher payroll costs and depreciation expense 
average headcount increased in and depreciation expense increased as a result of significant purchases of advanced test equipment during the first half of we believe continued investment in product enhancements and new product development is critical to achieving our strategic objectives  and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support activities  costs associated with trade shows  advertising  and promotions  and the cost of facilities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million in primarily due to the expansion of our worldwide sales force and increased variable performance based compensation  which resulted in a million increase in sales personnel costs  and increased carrying costs of million associated with additional evaluation and demonstration inventory units in the field  offset by a decrease in marketing expenses of million 
our sales and marketing headcount grew from at the end of to at the end of notwithstanding this growth in headcount  our marketing expenses decreased in due primarily to lower advertising  trade show  and seminar costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million in  primarily due to increases of million for advertising and trade shows  million for compensation costs  and million of amortization associated with demonstration and evaluation equipment 
during  we increased our marketing efforts to introduce our new products such as our terabit capacity chassis and gigabit stackable products and increased our marketing and sales force to employees from in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  costs of facilities  bad debt  legal and accounting fees  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in from primarily due to a million decrease in legal expenses  a million decrease in accounting costs primarily related to sarbanes oxley act consulting fees  offset by a million increase in office rent expense and a million increase in payroll related costs 
the increase in rent expense was due to a new lease arrangement in march for  square feet of additional office space in santa clara  california 
as a result  our headquarters occupy approximately  square feet of office space 
general and administrative expenses increased million in  compared to  primarily due to an increase of million in legal fees related to the nortel and lucent patent infringement cases  million for sarbanes oxley related consulting fees related to compliance with sox  and million from reduced bad debt reserve requirements in  compared to no bad debt reserve requirements in 
table of contents litigation settlement 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement and patent cross license agreement with nortel 
as a result of the agreements  nortel s actions for monetary damages and an injunction against us were dismissed  and our suit against nortel was also dismissed 
pursuant to the agreements  we paid million to nortel and recorded an operating expense of million in the third quarter of the remaining amount paid to nortel represents consideration for a four year cross license with nortel and is being amortized ratably to cost of product revenue over the license term 
interest and other income  net 
we earn interest income on funds maintained in interest bearing money market and investment accounts 
we recorded net interest and other income of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increases each year were primarily due to higher investment balances combined with increasing interest rates throughout and our total cash and investment balances were million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively  year to year increases of over in and see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a description of our investment policy 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these rates reflect applicable federal and state tax rates  offset by research and development tax credits  export sales incentives  and tax exempt interest income 
our income taxes payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced  and stockholders equity increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan  or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  we receive an income tax benefit for the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the employee s option price  tax effected 
these benefits are credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accelerated vesting of stock options 
on november   the board of directors approved the immediate vesting of approximately million shares of unvested stock options previously awarded to employees and officers that have an exercise price of or greater under our equity compensation plans 
the closing market price per share of our common stock on november  was and the exercise prices of the approximately million in unvested options on that date ranged from to 
the board of directors made the decision to immediately vest these options based in part on the issuance of sfas r 
absent the acceleration of these options  upon adoption of sfas r  we would have been required to recognize approximately million in pre tax compensation expense from these options over their remaining vesting terms as of december  we also believe that because the options that were accelerated had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of our common stock  the options were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 
expensing of stock awards 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which was effective for us on january  sfas r will result in our recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
in and prior years  we used the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under the new accounting standard  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards  which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and therefore will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation  on a pre tax basis  to be expensed in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million 
to the extent that we grant restricted stock and additional stock options to employees and directors  stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants 
in addition  our tax rate may fluctuate significantly between periods based on the extent of employee gains recognized on stock option exercises 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods 
table of contents required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during   and liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash and investments increased million in from primarily due to cash generated from operations of million and the receipt of million of cash from issuances of common stock to employees 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of million  plus adjustments for non cash charges  including million of inventory provisions  million of depreciation and amortization  million of tax benefit from stock option exercises  and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the million increase in cash and investments from to was primarily the result of our pre tax profitability  which enabled us to generate million of cash from operations  and the receipt of million of cash from issuances of common stock to employees 
during  our inventory purchases increased million  our accounts receivable increased million  and cash payments for income taxes  net of refunds received  were million 
this is low relative to our pre tax income as a result of million of tax benefit from stock option exercises in inventories were million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively 
inventories were higher in as we significantly increased our production and service inventory levels to support a broader product offering and larger installed customer base 
inventory turnover was approximately   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  decreased million in and increased million in our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily affected by shipment linearity  collections performance  and timing of support contract renewals 
dso  calculated based on annualized revenue for the most recent quarter ended and net accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  decreased to days as of december   from days as of december   and from days as of december  dso was unusually high as of december  due to a higher amount of annual support contracts billed during december  with little or no revenue contribution in and less linear shipments during the fourth quarter of  in which approximately of our product revenue shipped during the last month of the quarter 

table of contents disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating leases of facilities purchase commitments with contract manufacturers total contractual cash obligations for purposes of the above table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable  legally binding on us  and that subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement 
our purchase commitments are based on our short term manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe our existing cash balances and anticipated funds from operations in will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
key factors affecting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital  in particular  inventories and accounts receivable  and future demand for our products and related pricing 
we may incur higher capital expenditures in the near future to expand our operations 
although we do not have any current plans or commitments to do so  we may from time to time consider the acquisition of products or businesses complementary to our business 
any acquisition or investment may require additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases of facilities and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers  we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties  a failure to perform certain covenants  or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
no amounts are reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of december  or related to these indemnifications 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our investment portfolio  which includes corporate and municipal bonds and government sponsored enterprise securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund 
for liquidity purposes  our investment policy requires that we maintain a minimum of million in money market accounts of suitable credit quality 
our investment portfolio  excluding auction rate securities  is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at amortized cost  and includes only securities with original maturities of less than two years and with secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
since we hold our investments to maturity  we are exposed to risk in the 
table of contents event an issuer is not able to meet its obligations at maturity 
to mitigate this risk  our investment policy does not allow us to invest more than million with any one issuer 
we do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
we have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps for the entire year  while all other variables remain constant 
hypothetical bps  bps  and bps declines in interest rates as of december  would reduce our annualized interest income by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  the majority of our international sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures 
for most currencies  we are a net payer of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a stronger us dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to those foreign currencies 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and using a modeling technique that measures the change in fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material loss in the fair values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at december  and
