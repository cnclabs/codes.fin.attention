item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general we were formed as a delaware limited liability company on december   and organized and began operations on january  inception date 
we were converted into a delaware corporation on april  when all of the outstanding equity interests of the limited liability company were converted into shares of common stock of the corporation 
overview we are engaged in the development of hydrogen battery technology for use primarily in portable electronic devices for the  military  medical  industrial and consumer markets 
we are developing this technology in partnership with corporate and government entities 
hydrogen on demand is the trademarked name for our proprietary hydrogen energy storage and delivery technology 
our technology is based on the culmination of work reflected in more than patents granted or pending that collectively provide us with a leading position in the system and fuel blend technology used to convert sodium borohydride to hydrogen energy for use in portable electronic device applications 
our losses have resulted primarily from costs associated with product development and research and development activities as well as non cash amortization of preferred stock and non cash charges related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to employees and third parties 
as a result of planned expenditures in the areas of research  product development and marketing and additional non cash charges relating to employee stock options  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
results of operations year ended december  versus revenues 
we recorded  of revenues during the year ended december  compared with revenues of  in  an increase of  the increase was mainly attributable to revenues earned from engineering and design services rendered under our contract with concurrent technologies corporation ctc that began in the fourth quarter of  and design services rendered under a new contract signed with electronic machining srl in the third quarter of  which provided us an additional  in revenue 
while in the development stage  our revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year with the timing of prototype development and design services 
in the near term  revenues are expected to be derived substantially from up front license fees  research contracts with various federal  state and local agencies  collaborations with other companies  management services  and royalty payments or joint venture revenue from licensees or strategic partnerships 
revenues will be recognized in the period in which technology is delivered  licensing revenues are earned  or as services are performed 
cost of revenues 
we recorded cost of revenues of  during the year ended december   as compared with  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase was mainly attributable to the addition of the ctc program in the fourth quarter of gross margin realized in was a result of design services revenue rendered for electronic machining  a new customer in cost of revenues during the development stage represent the product development and marketing expense and research and development expense associated with the revenues earned 
product development and marketing expense 
product development and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase is mostly attributable to an increase in the marketing staff in the first quarter of  as well as costs incurred to update our corporate image and to create a new company website 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase was mainly the result of the professional fees associated with the consummation of the joint development arrangement with the dow chemical company dow  the series c preferred stock private placement consummated with certain institutional investors  and the exchange offers with respect to our outstanding series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock 
we also incurred higher legal costs associated with intellectual property development 
non cash charges 
non cash charges were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the non cash charge increase is a result of the issuance of  shares of series a preferred stock to dow as part of the joint development arrangement 
this resulted in a non cash charge of  which was recorded as a product development expense 
the following is a breakdown by function of non cash charges as of december product development expense general and administrative expense research and development expense total depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease was mainly attributable to more assets becoming fully depreciated in fiscal than were added during the year 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is primarily due to increased number of employees in our research and development department and professional fees as compared to the prior year 
we are reimbursed for expenses under the department of energy doe program for the joint research of electrochemical pathways to manufacture sodium borohydride  which are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
reimbursements under the doe program totaled  and  for and  respectively 
interest expense 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to interest expense of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in net interest expense was caused mainly by reduced charges for beneficial conversion features and fewer conversions of convertible instruments into common stock during than in interest expense is comprised of interest on the series c preferred stock dividend  debenture principal  charges for beneficial conversion features  amortization of original issue discounts and issue costs on convertible debentures and preferred stock 
the components of interest expense were as follows for the years ended december  and in millions beneficial conversion feature bcf amortization of debt discount amortization of debt issue costs other interest  net total interest expense benefit from income taxes 
benefit from income taxes was  for the year ended december  as compared to  in this benefit was derived from our participation in the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program 
this program allows certain companies to transfer new jersey net operating losses to other companies 
the amount allowed for sale each year varies and cannot be accurately predicted 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows each year if we continue to incur net operating losses 
results of operations year ended december  versus revenues 
we recorded  of revenues during the year ended december  compared with revenues of  in the decrease was mainly attributable to engineering and design services under a short term contract that was performed during that were non recurring in the current year 
while in the development stage  our revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year with the timing of prototype development and design services 
cost of revenues 
we recorded cost of revenues of  during the year ended december   down from  for the year ended december  the decline in cost of revenue was attributable to fewer sales of large prototype systems and services to the transportation markets and more sales of smaller systems designed for the consumer electronics market 
product development and marketing expense 
product development and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this decrease is mostly attributable to ongoing cost reduction activities and our cost shared development program as a subcontractor to protonex for the us air force 
under this program  one half of our incurred costs are reimbursed and recorded as reductions to operating expense 
this program began during the second quarter of general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase was driven mainly by the accrual of separation costs of approximately  as a result of the resignation of our previous president and chief executive officer in march the separation costs were comprised of salary  benefits and other costs in satisfaction of his employment contract 
the remaining costs will be paid according to the following schedule total the unfavorable effect of the separation costs was mostly offset by the impact of ongoing cost reduction programs  including headcount reductions made early in  and the recovery of indirect costs under us government funded cost share programs which began in non cash charges 
non cash charges were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was mostly attributable to the completion of vesting in of below market value options issued to employees during the following is a breakdown by function of non cash charges as of december product development expense general and administrative expense research and development expense total depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  this was attributable to more assets becoming fully depreciated in fiscal than were added during the year 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease is mainly attributable to the reimbursement of expenses under the department of energy doe program for the joint research of electrochemical pathways to manufacture sodium borohydride 
this program reimburses us for of our qualifying costs under the program 
interest expense 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to interest expense of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was attributable to the issuance and subsequent conversion of the debentures issued in december and january through a private placement financing 
as the unsecured debentures were converted into common shares  the pro rata portion of the discount and charges related to the beneficial conversion features was recorded as interest expense 
during fiscal  approximately million of the debentures issued in the private placement financing had been converted to common stock as compared to million in fiscal the components of interest expense were as follows for the years ended december  and in millions beneficial conversion feature bcf amortization of debt discount amortization of debt issue costs other interest  net total interest expense benefit from income taxes 
benefit from income taxes was  for the year ended december  as compared to  in this income was derived from our participation in the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program 
this program allows certain companies to transfer new jersey net operating losses to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows each year if we continue to incur net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources general since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering in august and private placements of equity and debt securities 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering totaled approximately million and we generated net proceeds from private placement transactions in and totaling million 
in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from a separate private placement transaction 
in april  we received net proceeds of approximately million for the issuance of redeemable series c preferred stock 
convertible debentures on november   we issued to the ballard power systems inc ballard a million secured convertible debenture with a maturity date of november  on september   ballard sold its debenture in equal amounts to three accredited institutional investors the investors in a private transaction 
in connection with such transfer  we issued an  secured convertible debenture  in substance identical to the ballard debenture  to each of the investors 
on november   we issued an amended and restated convertible debenture each  a new debenture to each of the investors as consideration for the investors agreement to surrender their original debentures and cancel the standby letters of credit issued by wachovia bank  national association  that secured the original debentures  thus enabling us to use the formerly restricted cash for our operations 
the principal changes to the term of the debentures consisted of the reduction of the initial conversion price from to per share  an extension of the maturity date to september   and the provision for quarterly interest payments to the holders 
we relied on the exemption from registration under section a of the securities act in connection with the issuance of the new debentures 
no gain or loss was required to be recognized by us upon the exchange 
in accordance with eitf application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments and eitf accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  we will be required to record a beneficial conversion feature bcf interest charge if the company elects to convert debentures early at a discount 
private placement transactions during  and  we entered into a series of private placement financing transactions with three different institutional and accredited investors pursuant to the terms of separate securities purchase agreements among millennium cell and the purchasers 
the private placements were exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to section of such act 
the placements collectively raised million dollars through the sale of million in common stock and the issuance of million in convertible debentures 
as of december   all million of debentures have been converted into  shares of common stock 
series c preferred stock on april   we consummated a private placement financing transaction with seven institutional and accredited investors pursuant to the terms of a securities purchase agreement with such investors 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the investors paid million in cash for  shares of our redeemable series c preferred stock series c which shares were subsequently exchanged for a like number of shares of redeemable series c preferred stock in an exchange offer conducted by us 
each series c share is convertible into hundred shares of our common stock  at any time  at an initial conversion price equal to per share subject to adjustment based upon customary anti dilution provisions  or lower based upon the market price of our common stock during the ten trading days preceding conversion 
the shares of series c bear a cumulative dividend payable quarterly in shares of common stock or cash  at our option  and are junior to the series a and series b preferred stock in liquidation preference 
the series c is subject to mandatory redemption by us three years after issuance and can be settled in cash or with our common stock 
as a result  the series c is recorded as a liability in accordance with fas accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
additionally  we issued to the investors three year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  subject to adjustment based on customary antidilution protections 
the warrants were valued at  at the date of issuance and were recorded as a discount to debt and as additional paid in capital on the balance sheet and will be amortized as interest expense throughout the term of the series c or as they are converted  whichever comes first under the series c purchase agreement with the investors  we are required to restrict funds for future dividends to be paid with respect to the series c 
as a result  these funds  which amounted to approximately  at issuance  were classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet 
as of december   we issued  shares valued at  in satisfaction of the quarterly dividend payments with respect to series c 
total dividends of  which include dividends paid in cash and common stock were recorded as interest expense since the series c was recorded as a liability as of december  
according to the series c purchase agreement  as dividends are issued or paid  and conversions are executed  the restricted cash is released ratably to our non restricted cash accounts 
as of december   approximately million of the series c have been converted into  shares of our common stock and we have transferred  from the restricted cash account for the conversions that were executed 
we relied on the exemption from registration under section of the securities act in connection with the series c issuance 
we filed a registration statement with the sec  which covered the resale of shares of common stock underlying the series c and shares underlying the warrants issued to the series c holders  and it was declared effective on july  series a preferred stock on april   we consummated the first closing under a joint development arrangement with dow 
in connection with the closing  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to dow which shares were subsequently exchanged for a like number of shares of series a preferred stock in an exchange offer conducted by us  each share of which is convertible into ten shares of our common stock 
as a result of the series a issuance in exchange for services rendered by dow in conjunction with the joint development arrangement  we recorded a non cash charge of  as product development expense based on the market value of the underlying common stock as of april  the series a has substantially the same rights of our common stock  therefore the series a was valued based on the close of our common stock on april  we relied on the exemption from registration under section of the securities act of in connection with the issuance 
the purpose of the joint development arrangement is for the two companies to jointly develop portable power solutions based on our hydrogen on demand energy systems coupled with a fuel cell 
the joint development agreement has a three year term and each party may terminate the joint development agreement under certain conditions 
the joint development arrangement contemplates a series of four milestones designed to culminate in a commercially available product 
the milestones are focused on military and or consumer electronics applications 
achievement of milestones  as defined in the joint development arrangement  in either military or consumer electronics applications will be sufficient to trigger equity transactions at dow s option upon the successful completion of each of the four milestones  dow has a right  but not an obligation  to purchase a number of shares of our series b preferred stock which is convertible into a number of shares of our common stock that could be purchased for  based upon a purchase price equal to the volume weighted average price for the trading day period prior to the date of issuance 
if dow purchases shares of our series b preferred stock  they will also receive warrants to purchase a number of shares of our common stock that equals of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred stock 
if dow purchases shares of our series b preferred stock in such instances  we will issue to dow additional shares of series a preferred stock such that dow will own a certain percentage of our capital stock as of the date of issuance as provided in the dow stock purchase agreement 
if dow elects not to purchase shares of our series b preferred stock upon completion of any milestone  we will issue to dow a lesser number of additional shares of series a preferred stock 
subsequent events gecko on february   we entered into a three year joint development program with gecko energy technologies  inc gecko to collaborate on the development and commercialization of portable fuel cell systems for use in military  medical  industrial and consumer electronics applications 
these products will pair our patented hydrogen on demand technology with gecko s thin planar proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells to create a hydrogen battery that is lighter  smaller and less expensive than traditional batteries for a variety of applications 
gecko s efforts are focused on the development of an easy to manufacture fuel cell that provides portable device makers with design flexibility by allowing the thin power source to be part of the exterior surface of the device itself 
in addition to the joint development program  we have acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of gecko in exchange for  in cash and a one year commitment of services and facilities valued at million 
later in the year  we will increase our position to a total of of gecko s outstanding common stock by investing another million in cash or our common stock 
as part of the transaction  we received the right to increase our position  at our sole option  up to a total of of gecko s outstanding common stock over the remaining two years of the agreement at fair value of the common stock on the date of the acquisition 
new debenture conversion on february   we converted an aggregate  of the new debentures into  shares of common stock 
we recorded a beneficial conversion feature charge of  in conjunction with the conversion 
sources and uses of cash as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of  cash used in operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively  and related to funding our net operating losses 
excluding changes in restricted cash  investing activities used cash of   and  in  and  respectively 
investing activities in consisted of patent registration costs while in we also purchased laboratory equipment to support our research 
restricted cash is comprised of million as security on series c preferred dividends and million of cash used for collateral as security deposit held by our landlord in connection with the amended lease agreement 
these funds used will not be available for use in operations until the letters of credit have been reduced or terminated 
the million of restricted cash related to the series c preferred will be available to us ratably as dividends are paid to the holders or as they are converted  whichever comes first 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  commitments and contingencies in april  we amended our main operating lease for our facility to provide for additional space for our principal operating offices and laboratories 
the amended lease will expire in and contains options to renew for an additional eight years and will require us to pay our allocated share of taxes and operating costs in addition to the annual base rent payment 
future minimum annual lease commitments excluding estimated allocated taxes and maintenance under the amended operating leases are noted below 
in connection with the amended lease agreement  we issued a letter of credit to the landlord for  in lieu of a cash security deposit 
we collateralized the letter of credit with a portion of our cash and classified the letter of credit as restricted cash 
the funds used for collateral will not be available for use in operations 
between january and april  we received an aggregate of  from a recoverable grant award from the state of new jersey commission on science and technology 
the funds were used to partially fund costs directly related to development of our technology 
the recoverable grant is required to be repaid when we generate net sales in a fiscal year 
the repayment obligation  which began in june  escalates from to of net sales over a ten year period 
we are obligated to repay the unpaid amount of the original grant at the end of the ten year period 
as of december   we have repaid approximately  and an additional  was paid in the first quarter of the contractual obligations discussed above are outlined in the following table payment due in fiscal years contractual obligations total operating lease facility refundable grant obligation capital lease obligations redeemable series c preferred stock convertible unsecured debentures total redeemable series c preferred stock and convertible unsecured debentures are convertible into common stock or can be satisfied with cash 
we received net proceeds from the sale of new jersey net operating losses nols in conjunction with the new jersey emerging technology and biotechnology financial assistance program of   and  in  and  respectively 
this program allows certain companies to apply to transfer new jersey nols to other companies 
this program  if continued by the state in future years  may provide us with similar cash inflows if we continue to incur nols 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash from our cost sharing agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations through we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be assured that additional funding  if sought  will be available or will be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have had a material effect on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
our management has discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  convertible debt and stock options described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition our near term revenues will be derived substantially from contracts that require the company to deliver hydrogen generation technology  management services  system design and prototype systems and licensing of technology for test and evaluation 
revenues are recognized in the period in which the technology is delivered or licensed revenue is earned 
convertible debt we account for the issuance and conversion of convertible debt in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
as a result  we have and will record original issue discounts to the extent the fair value of the debt is below the face value of the instrument and amortize the discount over the life of the instrument 
to the extent conversions of debt into common stock are made prior to the maturity date of the instrument  we will record as interest expense a ratable proportion of the discount associated with the face value of the debt converted 
we account for issuances of convertible debt in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments eitf no 
 and eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 

as a result of certain conversion price discounts included within our outstanding debt instruments  we will record interest expense resulting from bcfs as described under the caption liquidity and capital resources above 
stock options we have recorded non cash charges in  and of the fair value of warrants issued to a board member  certain affiliates and third parties 
certain affiliates have the ability to earn new awards based on defined milestones and service periods 
the accounting methodology requires a re valuing of the related earned warrants at each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
due to this variable accounting methodology  it is difficult to predict the amount of additional non cash charges we will incur related to these warrants 
we also record non cash charges for the difference between the grant price and market price on the date of grant related to certain stock options issued to employees and elected directors below market prices as defined by apb no 
the non cash charge is recognized ratably over the related vesting period of the respective option contracts 
as of june   all of these options were vested and there will be no further charges 
we also disclose pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share that is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
we have estimated the fair value of options granted for the fiscal years ended december   and at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
our options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
due to these highly subjective assumptions  the non cash charges incurred in  and for warrants issued to affiliates and the pro forma disclosures of net loss and loss per share for fiscal  and  are not likely to be representative of non cash charges and the pro forma effects on net loss and loss per share  respectively  in future years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r will become effective for all registrants as of the first fiscal year beginning after june  therefore  our required effective date is january  our current estimate of the annual net loss effect in of adopting sfas r in january is to increase net loss by approximately  in may  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas is a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and fasb statement no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and we will adopt this standard on january  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have any impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in us interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and are generally of a short term nature 
as a result  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
our systems ability to produce energy depends on the availability of sodium borohydride  which has a limited commercial use and is not manufactured in vast quantities 
there are currently only two major manufacturers of sodium borohydride and there can be no assurance that the high cost of this specialty chemical will be reduced 
once we commence full operations in the future  we may need to enter into long term supply contracts to protect against price increases of sodium borohydride 
as a result  we may be subject to commodity price risk in the future and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into agreements to protect against such risk
