our principal customer is the us government 
revenue generated from contracts to federal government agencies and their prime contractors represented approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our principal us government customer is the dod  which  directly or through its prime contractors  accounted for approximately   and  of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
nasa is also a significant customer  generating   and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for fiscal years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue and  and  respectively  of our operating income came from one prime contract with an agency within the department of defense 
for fiscal years ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue came from one prime contract with nasa  which will continue until september  if the remaining contract option is exercised in we expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the source of substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we provide our services through one reportable segment  comprised of two strategic business units  our homeland security group hsg and our systems engineering group seg 
hsg accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  hsg provides information technology services  aerospace engineering services and security and intelligence support services to the agencies within the intelligence community such as the national reconnaissance office nro  the missile defense agency and the national security agency 
hsg also provides services to the dod  and major aerospace contractors  such as lockheed martin and northrop grumman 
we expect that our homeland security group will continue to benefit from the country s shifting priorities towards national defense and homeland security and emphasis on enhanced intelligence capabilities 
seg accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  seg provides aerospace engineering services and information technology services  including program management support  primarily to nasa and major aerospace contractors in support of the development of space based systems 
seg also supports the operation of terrestrial assets and the launch of unmanned rockets by nasa under our expendable launch vehicle integrated support elvis contract 
specific capabilities of the systems engineering group include expendable launch vehicle engineering  space systems development  and ground support for space operations 
on april   we acquired comglobal systems  incorporated comglobal 
comglobal  a software engineering and information technology firm  specializes in ci programs for the military 
its largest customer is the us navy s tomahawk cruise missile program 
comglobal is a wholly owned subsidiary of analex and is reported as a part of our homeland security group 
on may   we acquired beta analytics  inc bai 
bai s services cover a range of life cycle protection and physical security services specifically in the areas of information protection  physical security  intelligence threat assessment and analysis  technology protection  security management and security education and training 
bai is a wholly owned subsidiary of analex and is reported as a part of our homeland security group 
during the second quarter of  we concluded that our then wholly owned subsidiary  advanced biosystems  inc abs  did not fit with our long term strategic plan and decided to divest abs 
abs was engaged in biomedical research for broad spectrum defenses against toxic agents capable of being used as bioterrorist weapons  such as anthrax and smallpox 
we disposed of abs on november  therefore  the results of operations of abs are reported as discontinued operations  net of applicable income taxes  for all periods presented 
historically  we reported abs as a separate business segment 
we generate a majority of our revenue as a prime contractor to the federal government 
our objective is to focus on retaining and increasing the percentage of our business as a prime contractor because we believe it provides us with stronger client relationships 
the following table summarizes our revenue as a prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the years ended december  prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue all of our us government contracts are subject to audit and various cost controls  and include standard provisions for termination at any time at the convenience of the us government 
multi year us government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funding for contract performance for any subsequent year becomes unavailable 
selected key metrics evaluated by management we manage and assess the performance of our business by evaluating a variety of metrics 
selected key metrics are discussed below 
revenue growth our revenue growth during was driven primarily by strategic acquisitions 
our total revenue growth rate was for  compared to for organic growth decelerated in as certain customers experienced funding reductions to help offset the cost of the continuing war in iraq 
we have recently begun to make incremental investments in a centralized business development team and new processes that we believe will improve future organic revenue growth 
contract backlog future growth is dependent upon the strength of our target markets  our ability to identify opportunities  and our ability to successfully bid and win new contracts 
our success can be measured in part based upon the growth of our backlog 
the following table summarizes our contract backlog as of december  funded backlog unfunded contract value total estimated backlog our total backlog of over million as of december  represented a increase over the backlog as of december  we currently expect to recognize revenue during fiscal from approximately of our total backlog as of december  contract mix contract profit margins are generally affected by the type of contracts we have 
we can typically earn higher profits on fixed price and time and material contracts than cost plus fee contracts 
thus  an important part of growing our operating income is to increase the amount of services delivered under fixed price and time and material contracts 
the following table summarizes our historical contract mix  measured as a percentage of total revenue  for the years ended december  cost plus fee time and material fixed price total while our government clients typically determine what type of contract will be awarded to us  where we have the opportunity to influence the type of contract awarded  we will pursue time and material and fixed price contracts for the reasons discussed above 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda we believe ebitda is useful in evaluating our results because it excludes certain non cash expenses that are not directly related to our core operating performance 
ebitda is calculated by adding net interest expense  income taxes  discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization to net income 
ebitda for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
ebitda  as a percentage of revenue  the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  is a non gaap financial measure under applicable sec rules 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda should not be considered as a substitute either for net income  as an indicator of our operating performance  or for cash flow  as measures of our liquidity 
in addition  because all companies do not calculate ebitda identically  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
days sales outstanding days sales outstanding  or dso  is a measure of how efficiently we manage the billing and collection of our accounts receivable  our most significant working capital requirement 
for the fiscal quarter ended december  our dso was days 
this represents an increase over the approximately days we have historically experienced 
timing issues related to certain contract actions arising during the fourth quarter are primarily responsible for this increase 
we believe these contract actions have been addressed and expect our dso to trend more towards historical levels 
results of operations and related information the following table sets forth some items from our consolidated statements of operations  and these items expressed as a percentage of revenue  for the periods indicated

our homeland security group provided million  or  of our revenue for the year ended december  this represented an increase from the prior year 
contributing to this increase were the effects of our acquisition of bai in may  our acquisition of comglobal in april and increased independent verification and validation services provided in support of launches of expendable launch vehicles by the united states air force and the nro 
in addition  we provided increased information and technology asset protection solutions to various agencies within the united states government including the missile defense agency mda and counterintelligence field activity cifa 
our systems engineering group provided million  or  of our revenue for the year ended december  systems engineering group revenue increased approximately for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase is attributable to an increase in nasa directed purchasing and a increase in revenue from our elvis contract 
these increases were offset by the expected continued step down of our microgravity research development and operations subcontract mrdoc 
our revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the same period in the prior year 
the homeland security group provided million  or  of our revenue for the year ended december  this represented a increase from the prior year 
contributing to this increase was the effect of our acquisition of bai in may and also increased independent verification and validation services provided in support of launches of expendable launch vehicles by the united states air force and the nro 
the systems engineering group provided million  or  of our revenue for the year ended december  this represented a increase from the prior year 
this increase was attributable to growth in our services rendered in connection with our elvis and glenn engineering support services gess contracts both with nasa  which amounted to an aggregate increase of approximately million 
this increase was offset by a decline of million due to the expected continued step down of our mrdoc contract 
the gess contract is scheduled to end in april  and we plan to participate in a recompetition for the award of a follow on contract in cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
this increase resulted from our acquisitions of bai and comglobal 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  for year ended december  was attributable to a more profitable contract mix from our acquired companies offset by an increase in personnel fringe benefit costs in compared to the prior year 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  for year ended december  was attributable to the improved profitability of our contract base  which decreases cost of revenue in relation to revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from our acquisitions of bai and comglobal 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of what we believe were one time expenses in these expenses related to transition costs to fill senior executive positions  due diligence costs for an acquisition we did not close  and recording a reserve against a nasa receivable refer to item legal proceedings in this form k for a full description 
sg a as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
as we acquire and integrate companies  we expect to leverage our central corporate services  reducing the ratio of sg a to revenue 
for  the million of one time expenses increased sg a as a percentage of revenue approximately percentage points 
sg a for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
sg a as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in our sg a expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  was attributable to acquisition related integration costs  investments to support growth and enhance our central infrastructure and new expenditures to comply with public company reporting requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets depreciation expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from the prior year 
we acquired million of fixed assets with the comglobal acquisition in april and million of fixed assets with the bai acquisition in may the increased depreciation expense resulted from depreciation of these acquired fixed assets 
intangible amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
this increase was attributable to the additional amortization expense associated with the million of identifiable intangible assets resulting from the april acquisition of comglobal and the million of identifiable intangible assets resulting from the may acquisition of bai 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from the prior year 
this increase resulted from the depreciation expense associated with the million of fixed assets we acquired as part of the bai acquisition in may intangible amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
this increase was attributable to the additional amortization expense associated with the million of identifiable intangible assets resulting from the may acquisition of bai 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
operating margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in our operating margin resulted primarily from the increased amortization expense associated with acquisition related identifiable intangible assets 
operating income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
operating margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the prior year 
the increase in our operating margin was attributable to improved contract profitability  offset by increased sg a expenses as described above and increased amortization expense associated with our bai acquisition 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda  as defined below  for the year ended december  was million after adding depreciation and amortization of million and intangible amortization of million to operating income of million 
this was an increase of million  or from the prior year 
ebitda  as a percent of revenue  was compared to for the prior year 
the increase in ebitda margin for the year ended december  was attributable to higher contract profitability and improved sg a leverage despite the million of one time expenses described above 
ebitda for the year ended december  was million after adding depreciation and amortization of million and intangible amortization of million to operating income of million 
this was an increase of million  or from the prior year 
for the year ended december  ebitda  as a percent of revenue  was compared to for the prior year 
the increase in ebitda margin for year ended december  was attributable to improved contract profitability offset by the higher sg a expenses described above 
ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  is a non gaap financial measure under applicable sec rules 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda is a widely used measure of operating performance 
it is presented as supplemental information that we believe is useful to investors in evaluating our results because it excludes certain non cash expenses that are not directly related to our core operating performance 
ebitda is calculated by adding net interest expense  income taxes  discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization to net income 
ebitda should not be considered as a substitute either for net income  as an indicator of our operating performance  or for cash flow  as measures of our liquidity 
in addition  because all companies do not calculate ebitda identically  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
for year ended december   we recorded million of interest expense incurred on our series b senior subordinated notes 
we did not record any interest expense on our series b senior subordinated notes during the year ended december  because in september  we converted these notes into our series b convertible preferred stock 
the elimination of the interest on our series b note was partially offset by increased interest expense associated with the million borrowed on our credit facility in connection with our acquisition of comglobal 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the same period in the prior year 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of interest expense incurred on our series b senior subordinated notes  which originated in may and were converted into series b convertible preferred stock in september we also recorded a full year of interest on our series a convertible notes  which originated in december provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
our effective tax rate  or the ratio of income tax expense reported in relation to income from continuing operations before income taxes  is impacted significantly by the non tax deductible interest and accretion expense associated with our convertible notes and preferred stock issued since liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to finance the costs of operations pending the billing and collection of accounts receivable  to acquire capital assets  to pay the interest on our credit facility and convertible note  to make quarterly dividend payments on our convertible preferred stock and to make selective strategic acquisitions 
cash flow for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
cash flow from operating activities begins with net income from continuing operations  which is adjusted by adding back non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and bad debt expense and then adjusted for the changes in working capital accounts 
accounts receivable represents one of our largest components of working capital 
our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
for the year ended december   compared to  our operating income grew  increasing the amount of operating cash flow 
this operating income growth was offset by increases in our working capital resulting from an increase in our fourth quarter dso 
this increase resulted from the fact it took an extended period of time to resolve certain contract actions with three customers during the fourth quarter 
the collection of approximately million of accounts receivable was delayed as a result 
we believe these contract actions have been addressed and expect our dso to trend more towards historical levels 
for the year ended december   compared to  our operating income grew  improving our operating cash flow 
this operating income growth was offset by increased use of cash by our discontinued operation 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
our cash flows from investing and financing activities were primarily attributable to our bai acquisition in may and our comglobal acquisition in april in may  we issued our series b notes  receiving million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds  in conjunction with financing proceeds of million we received in december  to fund the cash portion of the purchase of bai 
the total purchase price of bai  including transaction related costs  was million 
in april  we received proceeds of million when we issued our series b convertible preferred stock 
in addition  we borrowed million from our senior revolving credit facility 
we used these proceeds to purchase comglobal 
the purchase price of comglobal  including transaction related costs  was million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the details and a summary of changes in our financing instruments issued in connection with our and acquisition activity 
credit facility and borrowing capacity we have a long standing relationship with bank of america  na the bank 
part of our relationship with the bank includes a revolving line of credit the credit facility used for senior acquisition financing and working capital requirements 
on april   in connection with the acquisition of comglobal  the credit facility was amended and restated to increase the amount of the facility from million to million  subject to a borrowing base determined based on our outstanding accounts receivable balance and certain financial covenants setting forth maximum ratios for total funded debt to ebitda and minimum ratios for fixed charge coverage 
as of december  we were in compliance with these covenants 
the credit facility has a maturity date of may  interest on the credit facility is at the libor rate plus an applicable margin as specified the agreement 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the credit facility was million 
the interest rate at december  was 
borrowing availability under our credit facility continues to be sufficient to fund normal operations 
available borrowing capacity on our credit facility at december  was approximately million 
the credit facility also restricts our ability to dispose of properties  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends except to holders of the series a and series b preferred stock or other distributions  create liens on assets  enter into certain leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  engage in mergers or consolidations  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
the credit facility is generally secured by all assets of our business 
private stock offering in march  our board of directors  including its compensation committee  comprised solely of independent directors  approved the sale of up to  shares of unregistered common stock to certain employees of comglobal as an inducement material to their employment with us 
in april  all of the approved shares of our unregistered common stock were sold to employees of comglobal 
we received  from the sale of such shares 
the sale was made in an exempt offering under rule of the securities act of  as amended 
we recognized  of stock compensation expense related to this transaction 
guarantees and commitments pursuant to the november  acquisition of the former analex  we issued  shares of our common stock to the shareholders representing all of the outstanding equity of analex the sellers 
of the  shares   shares are subject to a provision by which we guarantee for a five year period to reimburse the sellers the difference between the price at which they sell such shares and a guaranteed sales price 
as of december   the maximum amount payable under the terms of the guaranteed shares was approximately million 
as the fair market value of our common stock as of december  was in excess of the maximum guaranteed share price of per share  we did not accrue any amounts under the guarantee 
on november   we issued promissory notes to certain analex sellers totaling approximately million with a five year term  bearing interest at 
as of september  the outstanding balance of the promissory notes was approximately million 
we also entered into non competition agreements with former employees totaling million  on a discounted basis  payable over various periods with a current balance of  at december  in august  we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet to be used as our new corporate headquarters 
the lease commenced on january  and has a term of seven years with one optional renewal period of five years 
future minimum lease payments over the seven year lease term will be approximately million 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost is measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r requires liability awards to be re measured each reporting period and compensation costs to be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after june  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r during the first quarter of sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after the effective date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption for the impact of adopting this standard 
it is anticipated we will apply the modified prospective method upon adoption 
we expect that the initial adoption of sfas r will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we believe this reclassification will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks and hedging activities the company s outstanding bank debt bears interest at variable interest rates tied to libor 
the use of variable rate debt to finance operations and capital expenditures exposes the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
the company does not currently use interest rate swaps or other means to reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations 
the company does not hold any derivatives 
contractual obligations preferred stock holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock may require the company to redeem their series a preferred stock together with accrued but unpaid dividends in four equal quarterly installments any time on or after september   which is also the series b redemption date 
holders of two thirds of the series b preferred stock may also require the company to redeem their series b preferred stock together with accrued but unpaid dividends in four equal quarterly installments any time on or after september   the series b redemption date 
however  since the company has up to sixty days from the series b redemption date to make the first quarterly installment  the company s obligation to pay for the redemption price of both the series a and series b preferred stock is not triggered until november   at the earliest 
the table below summarizes this possible future contractual obligation 
financing instrument redemption payment period quarterly redemption price total redemption price series a preferred stock november  august   series b preferred stock november  august   debt  leases and other non cancelable obligations the company has contractual obligations to pay long term debt  leases and other non cancelable obligations 
the following table aggregates the amounts of these obligations as of december  year long term debt operating leases non compete agreements total total contractual obligations does not include line of credit 
payments for long term debt do not include interest payments 
lease commitments could require higher payments than shown in the table due to escalation provisions that are tied to various measures of inflation 
the lease commitments reflect only existing commitments and do not include future requirements necessary to replace existing leases 
in addition to the contractual obligations included above  the company also has routine purchase order commitments for materials and supplies that are entered into in the normal course of business and are not in excess of current requirements 
pursuant to the november  acquisition of analex  the company issued  shares of the company s common stock to the shareholders representing all of the outstanding equity of analex the sellers 
of the  shares   shares are subject to a provision by which the company guarantees for a five year period to reimburse the sellers the difference between the price at which they sell such shares and a guaranteed sales price ranging from to per share guaranteed shares  if such shares are sold within such period and if certain other conditions are satisfied 
as of december   the maximum that the company would be required to pay under the terms of the guarantee was  this amount is calculated by multiplying the number of shares subject to the guarantee by their associated guaranteed purchase price  assuming the company s common stock has no fair market value 
as of december   there were  shares with an associated purchase price guarantee of per share   shares with an associated guaranteed purchase price of per share  and  shares with an associated guaranteed purchase price of per share  and  shares with an associated guaranteed purchase price of per share 
as the fair market value of the company s common stock was in excess of the guaranteed share prices as of december   no amounts were accrued under the guarantee 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks and hedging activities the company s outstanding bank debt bears interest at variable interest rates tied to libor 
the use of variable rate debt to finance operations and capital expenditures exposes the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates
