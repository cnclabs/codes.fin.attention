item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result s of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report company overview as discussed in item  business  the company operates primarily in two industry groups  hvac and construction products 
prior to the fiscal year  the company reported its financial results in two reportable segments  essentially along the lines of these two industry groups 
the reportable segments were titled the heating and air conditioning segment and the construction materials segment 
prior to filing the annual report on form k for the fiscal year  management determined that its accounting for segments did not comply with sfas no 
as a result  the financial information presented for and in note to the consolidated financial statements has been restated and management s discussion and analysis has been revised to reflect this restatement in segment reporting 
the company also continues to report unallocated corporate and other amounts 
prior to filing the annual report on form k for the fiscal year  management concluded that there are four reportable segments within its two principal industry groups  the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment in the hvac industry group and the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and the door segment in the construction products industry group 
the heating and cooling segment produces and sells gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coils from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  williams furnace co 
wfc of colton  california 
the evaporative cooling segment produces and sells evaporative coolers from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  phoenix manufacturing  inc pmi of phoenix  arizona 
the operations of these two segments were previously combined and reported as the heating and air conditioning segment 
sales of these two segments are nationwide  but are concentrated in the southwestern united states 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies are offered from numerous locations along the front range of colorado operated by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries castle concrete company and transit mix concrete co  of colorado springs  transit mix of pueblo  inc of pueblo and rocky mountain ready mix concrete  inc of denver 
doors are fabricated and sold along with the related hardware from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mckinney door and hardware  inc of pueblo  colorado 
the operations of these two segments were previously combined and reported as the construction materials segment 
sales of these two segments are highly concentrated in the front range area in colorado although door sales are also made throughout the united states 
in addition to the above reporting segments  an unallocated corporate classification is used to report the unallocated expenses of the corporate office which provides treasury  insurance and tax services as well as strategic business planning and general management services and an other classification is used to report a small real estate operation 
expenses related to the corporate information technology group are allocated to all locations  including the corporate office 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sales of the company s hvac products are seasonal and weather sensitive except for fan coils 
revenues in the company s concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment are influenced by the level of construction activity and weather conditions along the front range of colorado 
sales for the door segment are not as strongly seasonal nor are they much affected by weather conditions 
historically  the company has experienced operating losses during the first quarter except when the weather is mild along the front range 
operating results typically improve in the second and third quarters reflecting more favorable weather conditions in colorado and the seasonal sales of evaporative cooling segment 
fourth quarter results can vary based on weather conditions in colorado as well as in the principal markets for the company s heating equipment 
the company typically experiences operating cash flow deficits during the first half of the year reflecting operating results  the use of sales dating programs extended payment terms related to the evaporative cooling segment and payments of the prior year s accrued incentive bonuses and company profit sharing contributions 
as a result  the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility tend to peak during the second quarter and then decline over the remainder of the year 
this trend has continued in cash and cash equivalents were  at the end of compared to  at the prior year end 
operations in provided  of cash compared to  in and  generated in the increase in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was due to changes in net working capital 
the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was largely due to a lower level of earnings before non cash expenses 
net working capital increased by  in compared to an increase of  in net cash used in investing activities was  in   in and  in capital expenditures for  and were   and  respectively 
current year expenditures were predominantly in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and included the completion of a batch plant in pueblo and a fines recovery system for the colorado springs sand operation 
expenditures during also included the capitalization of subsidized leasehold improvements in the new office space leased for the corporate office 
the capital expenditures in included a new batch plant in pueblo west and a truck tracking system 
the capital expenditures in included the construction of a maintenance facility in pueblo and completion of the brighton batch plant begun in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment were   and  during  and  respectively 
the sales of an excess parcel of land adjacent to one of the colorado springs batch plants and the site of the closed pueblo west plant accounted for  of the cash proceeds 
in addition  during the company received a note for  related to one of the property sales 
sales of two parcels of real estate generated  of the proceeds 
budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately  which is approximately  more than planned depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the expenditures are primarily for routine replacement and upgrades 
the company expects that the expenditures will be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
the principal amount of the term loan was increased by  during see additional discussion of the term loan under revolving credit and term loan agreement  below 
approximately  of the proceeds were used to fund the purchase of the company s stock under the modified dutch auction tender offer completed during the second quarter  and to pay related fees and expenses 
under the company s ongoing share repurchase program  an additional  was used to acquire shares during a total of  shares were acquired during scheduled long term debt payments of  were made during the year 
during  the remaining outstanding options were exercised for  shares  shares net of  shares tendered as payment of option price which generated proceeds of  for the company and resulted in a  tax benefit the tax benefit is classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
scheduled long term debt payments of  were made during the year including the final  due on capital lease obligations 
under the company s ongoing share repurchase program  cash of  was used to acquire  shares during during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
scheduled long term debt payments of  were made during the year including  against capital lease obligations 
cash of  was used to acquire  shares of treasury stock 
revolving credit and term loan agreement the company signed a revolving credit and term loan agreement credit agreement with lasalle bank national association and fifth third bank in september on june   the company entered into the third amendment to the credit agreement 
the third amendment increased the initial principal amount of the term loan to  an increase of  over the then current balance 
the proceeds of the term loan facility were primarily used to fund the purchase of the company s stock under the modified dutch auction tender offer and to pay related fees and expenses 
the revolving credit portion of the credit agreement remained at  the third amendment also reset the amount authorized for the repurchase of the company s own stock to  separate from purchases made in connection with the tender offer 
both credit facilities are unsecured 
the credit agreement provides that  at the company s option  the term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at prime or a performance based libor rate 
based on the terms of the third amendment  the increase in the term loan and the company s performance for the twelve months ended december   the performance based rates would be libor plus for the term loan and libor plus for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
such rate is subject to adjustment depending upon the company s performance 
payment of accrued interest is due and payable quarterly by the company 
payments of principal under the term loan are payable on a quarterly basis  ending on march  at december    was outstanding on the term loan 
there were no borrowings against the revolving credit facility leaving  available after reserving  for the outstanding stand by letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is available at the discretion of management 
it is primarily used for funding the seasonal sales programs related to the furnace and evaporative cooler product lines 
as noted  the line is also used to secure stand by letters of credit to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program 
during the fiscal year  the highest amount of company borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  not including the amount securing stand by letters of credit  was  and the average amount outstanding was  subsequent to the year end  the company entered into a fourth amendment to the credit agreement 
this fourth amendment  signed june   increases the principal amount of the term loan portion of the credit agreement by  the additional proceeds may be drawn in whole or in part on or before july  for business expansion 
as of the date of the filing of this report on form k  the company had not drawn any of the additional  and the amount outstanding on the term loan was  the revolving credit facility was also increased from  to  under the terms of the fourth amendment primarily due to increased stand by letters of credit requirements to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program and to provide additional liquidity 
the company has not drawn any of this additional amount as of the date of the filing of this report on form k 
all other material terms of the credit agreement remain in force  except to the extent they have been modified by the fourth amendment as described in this paragraph 
see note on page of this form k 
effective december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement in order to minimize the adverse impact of the floating interest rate characteristic of most of the company s term loan borrowings 
the company s current effective interest rate on the portion of the outstanding term loan covered by the swap agreement is 
the company concluded that it was appropriate to take advantage of the interest rate environment and fix the interest rate at a relatively low level for a five year period 
at december   the amount subject to this swap agreement is  which amount decreases by  each september and march  terminating on december  the company believes that its existing cash balance and anticipated cash flow from operations  supplemented by seasonal borrowings against the revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
insurance policies the company maintained insurance policies since march  with the following per incident deductibles and policy limits deductible policy limits product and general liability workers compensation auto and truck liability should the aggregated out of pocket payments for the three policies exceed  during a policy year  deductibles on future claims are waived and the policies pay all amounts up to the policy limits 
should any  or all policy limits be exceeded  an umbrella policy is maintained which covers the next  of claims 
obligations and commitments the following tables represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments as of december  payments due by period as of december  amounts in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt including interest see note operating leases see note minimum royalty agreement see note total contractual obligations interest on long term debt is computed using the interest rate in effect at december  and gives effect to the swap agreement 
the interest amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facility because future borrowings under this facility are unknown at this time 
amounts of commitment expiration per period as of december  amounts in thousands other commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements that would be likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations consolidated sales were  in   in and  in the increase in over the sales was realized primarily by the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment although the door and evaporative cooling segments also reported gains 
the increased sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment was the result of both volume increases due to construction activity along the front range of colorado as well as price increases in response to higher cement and fuel costs 
the sales volume declined modestly in the heating and cooling segment where warmer than usual weather in california throughout most of the year depressed sales 
although all of the segments experienced a high level of price competition during  some price improvements were introduced in response to higher costs 
the increase in sales for compared to was also primarily realized by the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment although the heating and cooling and the door segments also reported gains 
the higher sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment was primarily due to higher volume driven by increased construction activity along the front range in colorado 
concrete prices also improved in response to increased cement and fuel costs except in the denver market which remained highly competitive 
the company experienced a high level of price competition in all of its product lines during  especially in the denver ready mix concrete market 
during  steel and fuel prices dramatically outpaced the general rate of inflation 
the company was able to recover a portion of the cost increases through higher selling prices 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization increased as a percentage of sales from for to for the increase in percentage was due to competitive market conditions which prevented sales price increases from fully recovering the material and fuel cost increases 
an increase in workers compensation claims also added to the costs during cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization increased as a percentage of sales from for to for the increase in percentage is due to the above noted increases in steel and fuel as well as higher cement costs 
an increase in workers compensation claims and the write off of  of remaining inventories associated with a product manufactured at our phoenix plant also increased costs 
the rate of increase in health care costs  noted as a problem during  subsided in depreciation  depletion and amortization declined from to and again from to reflecting the effect of reduced capital spending in recent years 
selling and administrative costs increased during as compared to primarily due to the increased sales volume 
as a percentage of sales  these costs declined modestly as compared to the administrative costs at the corporate office increased largely due to compensation 
selling and administrative costs within the segments varied and are discussed below 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in as compared to despite the increase in sales 
the decrease occurred as a result of a reduction in office staff and reduced legal expenses 
commissions related to the evaporative cooler sales declined reflecting the decrease in sales of coolers 
the gain on disposition of property and equipment increased during primarily due to a gain of  on the sales of property in colorado springs and pueblo during compared to the  gain generated by sales of two parcels of real estate in colorado during there were no similar large gains during operating income increased from  for to  for primarily as a result of the increased sales volume  the decrease in depreciation expense and the increased gain on the sale of property and equipment 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material and fuel costs 
the decline in operating income from  for to  for was primarily due to the increased raw material costs and lower evaporative cooler sales partially offset by the increased sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment  lower overall depreciation expense and the gain on sale of property in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
net interest expense increased during as compared to due to the increase in the amount outstanding under the term loan during and higher average interest rates during the year 
net interest expense declined during as compared to due to the lower debt balance as well as lower average interest rates during the year 
other income declined in from as a result of  of gain realized during on the settlement of property tax bills related to the oracle ridge mining partners property 
the company s effective income tax rates reflect federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the effective rates for and were reduced by and  respectively  for adjustments made to the accrual for tax contingencies as a result of the closure of tax years subject to audits by taxing authorities 
the rate was also reduced by for state tax credits 
the company s effective rate for was higher by due to an increase in the accrual for tax contingencies 
the company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies 
based on these reviews and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit  reserves are adjusted as necessary 
reserves for these tax matters are included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note as discussed above  the company operates primarily in two industry groups both of which are somewhat seasonal  weather sensitive and subject to cyclical factors 
the following addresses various aspects of operating performance focusing on the reportable segments within each of the two industry groups 
construction products the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the construction products group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies doors revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment improved to  in  an increase of  or over the amount of  concrete volume increased in colorado springs and denver while pueblo saw a small decline 
volumes improved primarily as a result of increased construction activity along the front range of colorado 
pricing improved at all locations largely in response to the higher cost of cement and fuel 
the denver operations also experienced an increase in their cost of aggregates 
although prices in the denver ready mix concrete market rose for the first time in three years  conditions remain very competitive 
the market wide cement shortage during the months of september and october has eased but management estimates that it resulted in lost concrete volume of to for the year 
we have since been able to obtain sufficient quantities of cement to accommodate our demand  however  the cement suppliers that currently service the front range have little excess manufacturing capacity 
aggregates sales improved as demand for concrete rose 
sales of construction supplies mirrored the increases experienced by the other products 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment sales for were  above the amount of  concrete volumes grew in all locations as construction activity along the front range in colorado improved modestly 
prices improved in the colorado springs and pueblo markets in response to increased cement and fuel costs 
price competition in the denver market remained high resulting in lower ready mix concrete prices despite higher cement and fuel costs 
sales of aggregates declined slightly due to a small decline in sales to third parties 
sales of construction supplies were strong and exceeded the level by over as a result of increased sales prices which passed through higher steel costs and increased volume which was the result of strategically timed purchases at a time of a tight industry supply of rebar 
operating income is highly sensitive to sales volume in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
this segment has also historically required a sizable investment in capital assets resulting in a large portion of its costs being relatively fixed in nature 
operating income as a percent of sales  therefore  generally increases and decreases at a higher rate but in tandem with sales changes 
operating income was  during and increased at a greater rate than sales as compared to the results of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales  however  increased from during to for the increased percentage was the result of a highly competitive market 
a higher level of workers compensation claims also increased costs at our colorado springs operations during the effect of the increased cost of sales dampened the effect of increased sales on operating profit 
there were several other factors that increased operating income during selling and administrative costs increased at a lesser rate than the improved sales primarily due to office staff reductions in denver 
depreciation  depletion and amortization declined reflecting the effect of reduced capital spending in recent years 
finally  the gain on disposition of property and equipment increased from the level primarily due to the transactions noted above in the discussion of consolidated results 
operating income as a percent of sales improved as a result of these factors 
the improvement in s operating income of  as a percent of sales as compared to the results reflects the above noted sensitivity to sales volume as well as the gain of  from the sale of two parcels of real estate in colorado 
the improvement  however  was partially offset by an increase in the cost of sales  as a percent of sales  from in to in this increase was due primarily to the intense competition in the denver market where sales prices continued to decline despite the increase in costs 
over the three fiscal years in the period ended january   the ready mix concrete prices in the denver market have declined despite the aforementioned increases in fuel  cement and other costs 
this situation was further exacerbated by an increase in workers compensation claims 
the construction supplies operations were affected by the rise in steel costs  however  the above noted strategically timed steel purchases during largely offset the higher prices 
the return on assets in was enhanced by the  decrease in assets that related to this segment s portion of the receivable for insured losses 
this asset  which we are required to record by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation  offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts  is offset by an equal liability for unpaid claims covered by insurance 
a change in this asset between years distorts the return on assets percentage 
the percentage return on assets improved in compared to primarily for the reasons set forth for the increase in operating income  although the improvement was dampened by the  increase in assets that related to this segment s portion of the receivable for insured losses discussed in the comparison of to above 
door segment sales in the door segment were  an increase of  or over the amount of  the increase was the result of a slightly stronger market and  to some extent  higher sales prices resulting from increased costs 
the sales figure was  or above the amount of  the increase in was primarily due to higher sales prices although they did not fully recover increased steel costs 
operating income was  during compared to  for the improvement was the result of the increased sales 
operating income for declined from s  despite increased sales as a result of our inability raise sales prices to fully recapture steel price increases 
the increase in operating income during is reflected in the improved operating income as a percent of sales as compared to the amounts 
the decline in operating income as a percent of sales for as compared to  despite the increase in sales  is due to the increased cost of sales in resulting from the increase in steel prices 
the return on assets for the three years reflects the changes in operating income as discussed above  however  the return for is further negatively impacted by the increase in segment assets 
this increase is primarily in accounts receivable which is the result of increased sales late in the year 
the increased sales during were achieved more ratably over the year resulting in little change in the year end receivables and total segment assets compared to hvac products the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the hvac products group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
heating and cooling evaporative cooling revenues from external customers segment operating income loss operating income loss as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets heating and cooling segment sales in the heating and cooling segment declined to  a decrease of  or from the amount of  a decline in furnace sales was partially offset by an increase in fan coil sales 
the decline in furnace sales was largely due to the loss of business to a large national home center account in one geographic location and warmer than usual weather in california throughout most of the year 
fan coil sales improved in a still weak market as the result of more competitive pricing 
sales for of  were  or  above the amount of  fan coil sales improved in a still weak market due to pricing decisions 
furnace sales were approximately the same as the prior year 
operating income declined from  for to  for partially due to the decrease in sales 
cost of sales  as a percent of sales  decreased from to 
margins improved as current year selling prices were adjusted to recover most of the increase in steel costs incurred during  however this recovery was partially offset by pricing decisions made from time to time in response to competition 
selling and administrative expenses increased during as a result of costs related to the replacement of the general manager at williams furnace co  including severance pay  and the addition of personnel in the sales and engineering departments 
the decline in operating income from  for to  for is primarily due to increased raw material costs 
cost of sales  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
the increased percentage was primarily due to increased steel costs during the year as noted above and an increase in workers compensation claims 
the increase in steel costs began during the second quarter of selling prices are generally established prior to the heating season which resulted in the increase in steel costs being absorbed by the company until the selling prices became effective and partially recovered the increased costs 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in as compared to the decrease was the result of a reduction in office staff and reduced legal expenses 
operating income as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both lower in compared to as a result of the lower operating income 
the factors that resulted in the reduced operating income are discussed above 
the decline in the return on assets was slightly higher as an increase in receivables and inventories raised the year end assets level at the same time that operating income declined 
the increase in both items is primarily a function of timing 
the change in the receivable for insured losses had an immaterial affect on the return on assets calculation for the heating and cooling segment when comparing to the decline in operating income as a percentage of sales for as compared to was due to the above noted reasons for the decline in the operating income for the decline in the return on assets was also due to these reasons in conjunction with an increase in the segment s assets at the year end 
as with the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment  part of the increase in assets for was an increase of  over the amount related to the heating and cooling segment s portion of the receivable for insured losses 
similar to the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment  this asset is offset by an equal liability for unpaid claims covered by insurance 
evaporative cooling segment sales in the evaporative cooling segment improved to  an increase of  or over the amount of  sales of evaporative coolers increased as a result of the partial recapture of the window unit business at a large national home center account and favorable weather that extended into august 
sales for were   or below the amount of  the decline was primarily due to losing the window unit business at a large national home center account 
operating results declined from  for to a loss of  for despite the increase in sales 
cost of sales  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
the increased percentage was due to pricing decisions made in response to pricing introduced by our largest competitor 
higher workers compensation claims and lower production volume also contributed to the higher cost ratio 
the decline in operating income from  for to  for is primarily due to the increased raw material costs and lower evaporative cooler sales 
cost of sales  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
the increased percentage was primarily due to increased steel costs during the year as noted above and the  write off of the remaining inventories associated with a product manufactured at our phoenix plant 
the increase in steel costs began during the second quarter of operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets for are not meaningful due to the operating loss incurred during the year 
the factors that resulted in the loss are discussed above 
the decline in operating income as a percentage of sales for as compared to was due to the above noted reasons for the decline in the operating income for the decline in the return on assets was slightly larger as the effect of the lower operating income was exacerbated by an increase in the segment s assets  primarily inventory as a result of the lower sales volume  at the year end 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 issued by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost at december  at last in  first out  with the remainder at first in  first out or market 
inventories are reviewed periodically for excess or obsolete stock with a provision recorded  where appropriate 
intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized as a charge to earnings 
the company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment as of the last day of its fiscal year 
in addition  to the extent that events occur  either involving the relevant company subsidiaries or in their industries  the company revisits its assessment of the recorded goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred and should be immediately recognized 
this assessment requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates  and growth rates 
no impairment was indicated in the current year 
if the assessment had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired  an impairment charge would have been recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable  however  changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unknown future events or circumstances could materially affect the estimated fair value 
liabilities the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general product and automobile liability  retaining certain levels of risk self insured portion 
provision for workers compensation claims is estimated with the assistance of an independent expert who applies actuarial methodology to information provided by the company s independent claims administrator 
provision for automobile claims is estimated based upon information provided by the company s independent claims administrator and the company s own experience 
with regard to product liability  provisions for both claims and unasserted claims that would be covered under the self insured portion of the policies are recorded in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and are reviewed at least annually for revisions in estimates 
the company records a reserve for future reclamation work to be performed at its various aggregate operations based upon estimates of the recoverable quantities of rock and sand available in each location combined with an estimate of the total expense that will be incurred to reclaim a property 
provision is made based upon the units of production method 
actual reclamation costs are charged against the reserve 
the adequacy of the recorded reserve is assessed annually 
the assessment may be done more frequently if events or circumstances arise that may indicate a change in estimated costs  recoverable material or the period of mining activity 
the company periodically engages an independent professional to assist in reevaluating the estimates of both the quantities of recoverable material and the cost of reclamation 
in a similar manner  depletion of rock and sand deposits and amortization of deferred development costs are computed by the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable quantities of rock and sand 
sales the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers 
sales are recorded net of estimates of applicable provisions for discounts  volume incentives  returns and allowances based upon current program terms and historical experience 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debt and warranty expense as well as an amount anticipated to be granted to customers under cooperative advertising programs based upon current program terms and historical experience 
recently issued accounting standards and tax law changes the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued the following statements and interpretations in november  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  was issued which amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment was issued and replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires using a fair value based model for the measurement of all employee share based payments  including grants of employee stock options 
deferred compensation calculated under the fair value method would then be amortized into income over the respective vesting period of the stock option 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  there are no stock options or other share based payments outstanding as of december  therefore the adoption of sfas r will not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition will only be impacted by sfas if the company implements a voluntary change in accounting principle or identifies and corrects accounting errors in future periods 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  as part of its short term international convergence project with the international accounting standards board 
under sfas  nonmonetary exchanges are required to be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gains or losses  if their fair value is determinable within reasonable limits and the transaction has commercial substance 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  accounting for stripping costs in the mining industry eitf which is effective on january  eitf states that stripping costs incurred after the first saleable minerals are extracted from the mine ie post production stripping costs should be considered costs of the extracted minerals and recognized as a component of inventory to be recognized in costs of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory 
the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition as the company currently treats post production stripping costs in the manner proscribed by eitf tax law changes include the american jobs creation act of the act was signed by the president on october  the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
the company does not expect the phase out of the eti to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
following the guidance in fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  the deduction has been treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction is reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company s tax return 
the deduction for did not have a material impact on the tax provision  however  the effect in the future may be significant depending upon the level of future income from qualified domestic production activities
