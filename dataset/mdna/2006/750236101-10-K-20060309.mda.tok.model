item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
as of december   our two largest states  measured by risk in force  were florida and california  with default rates of and  respectively 
in our mortgage insurance business  the insured lender is required to complete foreclosure proceedings and obtain title to the property before submitting a claim 
it can take anywhere from three months to five years for a lender to acquire title to a property via foreclosure  depending on the state 
therefore  on average  we are not required to pay a claim until to months following a default on a mortgage 
mortgage insurance claim volume is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the default 
claim volume also is affected by local housing prices and housing supply  interest rates and unemployment levels 
claim volume in our mortgage insurance business is not evenly spread throughout the coverage period of our book of business 
historically  most claims under mortgage insurance policies on prime loans occur during the third through fifth year after issuance of the policies  and on non prime loans during the second through fourth year after issuance of the policies 
after those peak years  the number of claims that we receive historically has declined at a gradual rate  although the rate of decline can be affected by macroeconomic factors 
approximately of the primary risk in force  including most of our risk in force on non traditional products  and approximately of the pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
because it is difficult to predict both the timing of originating new business and the run off rate of existing business  it also is difficult to predict  at any given time  the percentage of risk in force that will reach its highest claim frequency years on any future date 
our investigative services department is responsible for identifying and investigating insured loans involving non compliance with the terms of our master policy of insurance or commitment letter for structured transactions to ensure that claims are ultimately paid for  as agreed upon  valid and insurable risks 
much of our efforts involve the identification  investigation and reporting of mortgage fraud schemes that impact us 
we coordinate our activities with legal counsel  law enforcement and fraud prevention organizations  and work to promote mortgage fraud awareness  detection and prevention among our personnel and client lenders 

table of contents the following table shows claims paid information for primary mortgage insurance for the periods indicated year ended december in thousands direct claims paid prime alt a a minus and below seconds total states with highest claims paid texas georgia michigan north carolina colorado average claim paid prime alt a a minus and below seconds total a higher incidence of claims in georgia is directly related to what our risk management department believes to be questionable property values 
several years ago  our risk management department implemented several property valuation checks and balances to mitigate the risk of this issue recurring  and now applies these same techniques to all mortgage insurance transactions 
we expect this higher incidence of claims in georgia to continue until loans originated in georgia before the implementation of these preventive measures become sufficiently seasoned 
a higher level of claims in texas resulted  in part  from unemployment levels that were higher than the national average and lower home price appreciation 
we believe that claims in the midwest and southeast have been rising and will continue to rise due to the weak industrial sector of the economy 
we also believe that increased claims in michigan and north carolina are a result of declining economic conditions in those areas and that in colorado  increased claims are a result of a significant decline in property values in that area 
financial guaranty in the event of default  payments under a typical financial guaranty insurance policy that we provide or reinsure may not be accelerated without our or the primary insurer s approval  and without such approval  the policyholder is entitled to receive payments of principal and interest on their regularly scheduled dates as if no default had occurred 
the insurer often has remedies against other parties to the transaction  which may be exercised both before and after making payment  if any payment is necessary 
in our direct financial guaranty business  and with respect to some of the mortgage backed securities insured by our mortgage insurance business  we typically are obligated to pay claims in an amount equal to defaulted payments on insured obligations on their respective due dates 
in certain transactions in which we insure mortgage backed securities  we also are obligated to pay principal when and if due  but only to the extent the outstanding principal balance of the insured obligation exceeds the value of the collateral insuring the bonds at the end of a reporting period either monthly or quarterly 
in our financial guaranty reinsurance line of business  
table of contents net claim payments due to the ceding companies are typically deducted from premium amounts due to us 
for public finance  asset backed and other structured products insured by our financial guaranty business  we underwrite to a remote expected loss standard  which means that under historical economic and operating environments  the assets providing the cash flow to pay the obligations insured by us should perform within the range anticipated at origination and should mature without our having to pay any claims 
however  in a stressed or unexpectedly negative economic and operating environment  losses may occur 
accordingly  the patterns of claim payments tend to fluctuate and may be low in frequency and high in severity 
for our trade credit reinsurance line of business  which is currently in run off  we underwrote and priced this business to encompass historical loss patterns experienced by us and by ceding companies in similar businesses 
the claim payments in trade credit tend to follow the historical loss pattern of overall global economic conditions 
loss mitigation mortgage insurance our mortgage insurance loss management department consists of approximately full time employees dedicated to avoiding or minimizing losses 
these experienced specialists pursue opportunities to mitigate loss both before and after claims are received 
upon receipt of a valid claim in our traditional mortgage insurance business  we generally have the following three settlement options pay the maximum liability determined by multiplying the claim amount by the applicable coverage percentage and allow the insured lender to keep title to the property  pay the amount of the claim required to make the lender whole  commonly referred to as the deficiency amount not to exceed our maximum liability  following an approved sale  or pay the full claim amount and acquire title to the property 
in general  we base our selection of a settlement option on the value of the property 
in  we settled of claims by paying the maximum liability  by paying the deficiency amount following an approved sale and less than by paying the full claim amount and acquiring title to the property 
strong property values over the past few years have presented us with increased loss mitigation opportunities  thereby allowing us to avoid paying the maximum liability in over one out of five cases 
if housing values fail to appreciate or begin to decline  the frequency of loans going to claim may increase and our ability to mitigate our losses on defaulted mortgages may be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
for pre claim default situations  our specialists focus on the following activities to reduce losses communication with the insured or the insured s servicer to assure the timely and accurate reporting of default information  prompt and appropriate responses to all loss mitigation opportunities presented by the mortgage servicer  and proactive communication with the borrower  realtor or other individuals involved in the loss mitigation process to maximize results and to increase the likelihood of a completed loss mitigation transaction 
for post claim default situations  our specialists focus on reviewing and processing valid claims in an accurate and timely manner  promptly responding to post sale savings presented by the insured  and aggressively acting to dispose of real estate that we acquire through the payment of claims 

table of contents financial guaranty in our financial guaranty business  our surveillance risk management department is responsible for monitoring credit quality or changes in the economic or political environment that could affect the timely payment of debt service on an insured transaction and mitigating losses should they occur 
our surveillance procedures include periodic review of all exposures  focusing principally on those exposures with which we have concerns 
the specific procedures vary depending on whether the risk is public finance or structured finance  funded or synthetic  or direct or reinsurance  but the general procedures we follow for surveillance of risks include defining the scope and depth of individual transaction review based on the credit profile of the transaction  its size and the specific transaction characteristics  review of any changes to the ratings for those transactions that have been assigned a public rating by any of the major rating agencies  regular review of available news and other information  including subscription services and public sources  regarding the issuer  the specific insured transaction or the related industry  periodic internal meetings between risk management and the staff of the relevant business line to discuss potential issues related to the applicable risks  review of financial and other information  including periodic audited financial statements  that we require the relevant issuer to supply  and such other information that becomes publicly or otherwise available regarding the issuer or the specific insured transaction  the preparation of written reports that provide an internal credit scoring and a report on transaction performance against expectation 
we also review compliance with transaction specific covenants  classification of credits as intensified surveillance credits when we determine that continued performance is questionable and  in the absence of a positive change  may result in a claim 
a summary of our exposures to credits classified as intensified surveillance credits at december  and is included below in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations financial guaranty year ended december  compared to year ended december  provision for losses  and additional scrutiny of transactions over a specified amount or for which a covenant or compliance breach has occurred  including consideration of additional monitoring  discussion with industry experts  investment bankers  and others  and discussions with management and or site visits 
in our financial guaranty reinsurance business  the primary obligation for the determination and mitigation of claims rests with the primary insurer 
as a result  we rely on the primary insurers for loss determination and mitigation 
we and the rating agencies conduct extensive reviews of the ceding companies and their procedures for determining and mitigating losses 
moreover  to help align the ceding company s interests with our interests  the ceding company typically is required to retain at least of the exposure on any single risk that we reinsure 
as a part of its surveillance for reinsurance transactions  our financial guaranty business periodically re evaluates the risk underwriting and management of treaty customers and monitors the reinsured portfolio s performance 
as soon as our risk management department detects a problem  it works with the appropriate parties in an attempt to avoid a default 
loss mitigation can consist of restructuring the obligation  enforcing available security arrangements  working with the issuer to solve management or potential political problems and  if appropriate  exercising applicable rights to replace problem parties 
issuers typically are under no obligation to restructure insured transactions to prevent losses  but oftentimes do not want to be associated with an obligation that experiences losses 
when appropriate  we discuss potential settlement options  either at our behest or that of our counterparties  regarding particular obligations with appropriate parties 
on occasion  loss mitigation may include an early termination of our obligations  which could result in payments to or from us 
to determine the 
table of contents appropriate loss mitigation approach  we generally consider various factors relevant to such insured transaction  which may include the current and projected performance of the underlying obligation both on an expected case basis and stressed for more adverse performance and or market circumstances that we expect  the likelihood that we will pay a claim in light of credit deterioration and reductions in available payment reserves and existing subordination  our total exposure to the obligation  expected future premium payments and the cost to us of pursuing such remedies 
included on our list of intensified surveillance credits at december  is a derivative financial guaranty contract  representing million in exposure or approximately of our total exposure to intensified surveillance credits at december  while radian asset assurance had not been required to pay a claim with respect to this credit  given the deterioration of the credit quality of the portfolio of high yield debt obligations underlying this transaction  the significant amount of time before the expiration of this risk in and our large notional exposure to this credit  radian asset assurance recently engaged its counterparty in negotiations aimed at limiting our exposure arising from this credit 
on march   radian asset assurance entered into a settlement agreement with respect to this transaction and the one other derivative financial guaranty contract insured by radian asset assurance with this same counterparty 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations financial guaranty year ended december  compared to year ended december  provision for losses in item below for more information regarding the settlement of this transaction 
we believe that early detection and continued involvement by our surveillance risk management department has reduced claims 
reserve for losses we establish reserves to provide for losses and the estimated costs of settling claims in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
we have determined that the establishment of loss reserves in our businesses constitutes a critical accounting policy 
accordingly  a more detailed description of our policies is contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies reserve for losses included in item below and in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
mortgage insurance in our mortgage insurance business  reserves for losses generally are not established until we are notified that a borrower has missed two payments 
we also establish reserves for associated loss adjustment expenses lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
statement of financial accounting no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  standards sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses 
we maintain a database of claim payment history and use models  based on loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer  as well as more static factors  such as the estimated foreclosure period in the area where a default exists  to help determine the appropriate loss reserve at any point in time 
as a delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aging of the delinquent loan 
if a default cures  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
this curing process causes an appearance of a reduction in reserves from prior years if the reduction in reserves from cures is greater than the additional reserves for those loans that are nearing foreclosure or have become claims 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
we generally do not establish reserves for mortgages that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we calculate what the reserve would have been if there had been no deductible 
if the existing deductible is greater than the reserve amount for any given default  we do not establish a reserve for the default 
consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and industry accounting practices  we do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default or believed to be in default 

table of contents in january  we implemented a revised modeling process to assist us in establishing reserves in the mortgage insurance business 
in recent years  with the growth in the alt a and other non prime business  the change in the portfolio mix required us to segment the portfolio and evaluate the reserves required for each product differently 
the previous model had been designed for a prime product only and needed to be updated with years of additional data 
the revised model differentiates between prime and non prime products and takes into account the different loss development patterns and borrower behavior that is inherent in these products 
the model calculates a range of reserves by product and a midpoint for each product based on historical factors 
we then evaluate other conditions  such as current economic conditions  regional housing conditions and the reliability of historical data for new products  to determine if an adjustment to the midpoint calculated by the model is necessary 
at december   we made a judgment to reserve at a level within this range  but slightly above the midpoint  given the uncertainty around the ultimate performance of our non prime products and the potential overpricing in certain housing markets 
the new model did not result in an adjustment to the overall reserve for losses that we recorded 
we do not establish reserves for losses on mortgage insurance derivatives 
mortgage insurance derivatives are recorded at fair value in accordance with sfas no

table of contents financial guaranty we establish loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts 
we establish case reserves for specifically identified impaired credits that have defaulted and allocated non specific reserves for specific credits that we expect to default 
in addition  we establish unallocated non specific reserves for our entire portfolio based on estimated statistical loss probabilities 
generally  when a case reserve is established or adjusted  an offsetting adjustment is made to the non specific reserves allocated or unallocated  as applicable 
we do not establish reserves on our derivative financial guaranty contracts 
instead  gains and losses on direct derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models that take into account both credit and market spreads and are recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies derivative instruments and hedging activity in item below for a discussion of how we account for derivatives under sfas no 
in january and february of  we discussed with the sec staff  both separately and together with other members of the financial guaranty industry  the differences in loss reserve practices followed by different financial guaranty industry participants 
on june   the financial accounting standards board the fasb added a project to its agenda to consider the accounting by insurers for financial guaranty insurance 
the fasb will consider several aspects of the insurance accounting model  including claims liability recognition  premium recognition and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
in addition  we also understand that the fasb may expand the scope of this project to include income recognition and loss reserving methodology in the mortgage insurance industry 
proposed and final guidance from the fasb regarding accounting for financial guaranty insurance is expected to be issued in when and if the fasb or the sec reaches a conclusion on these issues  we and the rest of the financial guaranty and mortgage insurance industries may be required to change some aspects of our accounting policies 
if the fasb or the sec were to determine that we should account for our financial guaranty contracts differently  for example by requiring them to be treated solely as one or the other of short duration or long duration contracts under sfas no 
 this determination could impact our accounting for loss reserves  premium revenue and deferred acquisition costs  all of which are covered by sfas no 
management is unable to estimate what impact  if any  the ultimate resolution of this issue will have on our financial condition or operating results 
our financial guaranty business generally experiences relatively higher loss levels in certain of its other insurance businesses  such as trade credit reinsurance  than in its public finance or structured products businesses 
we believe that the higher premiums we receive in these businesses  as well as the lower relative capital charges  adequately compensate us for the risks involved 
reserves for losses and lae for trade credit reinsurance are based on reports and individual loss estimates received from ceding companies  net of anticipated estimated recoveries under salvage and subrogation rights 
in addition  a reserve is established for losses and lae incurred but not reported on trade credit reinsurance

risk management we consider effective risk management to be critical to our long term financial stability 
as such  we are looking to continuously enhance and integrate the risk management function across our business lines 
since the acquisition of efsg  we have sought to take the best practices existing in each business line and integrate them into a company wide risk management process 
in  we hired a chief risk officer to enhance our corporate wide 
table of contents credit processes  to further integrate our credit culture and to establish a single credit risk platform for analysis and valuation 
the chief risk officer is responsible for formulating corporate wide credit policy  maintaining the economic capital methodology  assessing model integrity  establishing and monitoring risk limits  and insuring adequate supporting technological and human resources are in place 
the respective heads of risk management in the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses report directly to the chief risk officer  with reporting responsibility to their business heads as well 
we have implemented a credit committee structure applicable to both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses 
overseeing this credit committee structure is the enterprise risk credit committee the erc  consisting mainly of members of company wide senior management 
the erc oversees individual credit committees organized by product line 
these product line committees include representatives of the product line  along with members of our credit policy  finance and legal departments 
we believe that this credit committee structure enables us to more fully utilize the intelligence  knowledge  experience and skills available throughout our company to evaluate the risk in each of our subsidiary s insurance in force and in proposed transactions 
in  our board of directors formed a committee of independent directors to assist the board in its responsibilities related to the oversight of our credit and risk management policies and procedures  including  heightening board level awareness of the impact of developing risk trends on our portfolio and plans 
the chief risk officer provides the committee with a quarterly review of all aspects of our credit risk  including notable transactions and a periodic assessment of the state of our risk management function 
in order to evaluate and review credit risk across the company  we have developed an internal economic capital methodology which allows us to attribute economic capital to each individual credit within our portfolio 
as such  economic capital provides us with a uniform risk measure for analyzing and valuing risk that is consistent across the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses 
the ability to measure risk in the same units allows us to set company wide position limits for our portfolio that account for both differences in loss probabilities for each credit and also for the correlation in loss probabilities across a portfolio of credits 
economic capital is also the basis for calculating risk adjusted returns on our capital raroc which allows us to establish criteria for weighing the credit risk borne relative to the premium received 
our economic capital methodology is heavily reliant on our models ability to quantify the underlying risks of default and prepayment 
we have established a model review and advisory committee to address the issue of how well our models perform their respective risk assessments 
this company wide committee is made up of representatives of our quantitative modeling groups in each business line with the chairperson reporting directly to the chief risk officer 
the results of the committee s model reviews are reported to and approved by the erc 
in addition to credit risk  we evaluate our risk by reviewing market risk  currency risk  interest rate risk  operational risk and legal risk across all of our businesses on a regular basis 
mortgage insurance in  in order to align the business to meet the needs of a changing business environment and to enhance credit risk awareness throughout the company  the mortgage insurance business moved to a business channel approach with four channels capital markets  strategic accounts  business direct and international see sales and marketing mortgage insurance in this item 
our mortgage insurance business has a comprehensive risk management function that is imbedded in the channels as well as a separate department  credit policy compliance  with three distinct functions credit policy  portfolio management and risk analytics and portfolio quality assurance 
the credit policy compliance group is focused on mortgage collateral and is responsible for overall credit policy creation and monitoring of compliance  portfolio management  limit setting and reporting  quantitative model creation and maintenance  comprehensive analytics and communication of credit related issues to management and our board of directors 
this group reports directly to the chief risk officer 

table of contents risk tolerance policies are established by our credit policy compliance group to allow each of the mortgage business channels to operate within a predetermined set of acceptable risk parameters 
compliance with these policies is enforced in two ways first  all risk functions in each of the mortgage business channels indirectly report to our credit policy and compliance group  and second  by direct monitoring and enforcement by our portfolio quality assurance department and our credit policy department 
our portfolio management and risk analytics department provides further surveillance at the portfolio level and coordinates with the business channels  which provide surveillance at the lender and loan level 
additionally  the credit policy compliance group chairs two of our credit committees the mortgage credit committee and the mortgage insurance credit committee 
the mortgage credit committee is responsible for approving all domestic and international financial guaranty and structured transactions that are conducted through radian insurance 
the mortgage insurance credit committee is responsible for approving all mortgage insurance risks that are outside our published guidelines and for approving changes to our proprietary scoring models 
credit policy the credit policy function is responsible for establishing and maintaining all mortgage insurance and financial guaranty credit risk policy around counterparty  portfolio  operational and structured risks secured by or involving mortgage collateral 
credit policy is also responsible for approving policy exception requests from the business channels 
additional responsibilities include establishing and monitoring portfolio limits for product types  loan attributes  and geographic concentrations  maintaining the flow rate card pricing return policy  economic capital policy review  developing standard commitment contract provisions and administration of the credit committees 
portfolio management and risk analytics our portfolio management and risk analytics department is responsible for three major functions risk analytics  quantitative models and surveillance 
risk analytics is responsible for analyzing risk in the overall market and portfolio  building reserving models for the mortgage insurance business  and performing a data and systems management function for the mortgage insurance business 
risk analysis involves analyzing risks to the portfolio from the market for example  analyzing the effects of changes in housing prices and interest rate movements and analyzing risks from particular lenders  products  and geographic locales 
quantitative models estimates  implements and controls our proprietary prophet models used to price any of our flow rate cards or structured transactions 
our proprietary prophet models jointly estimate default and prepayment risk on all of our major product lines 
these models and any changes to them are discussed in a model review forum and ultimately are approved by the mortgage insurance credit committee 
quantitative models also reviews and approves all third party models used to approve loans for delegated mortgage insurance 
surveillance is responsible for providing an independent view of risks assumed in all structured transactions in our mortgage insurance business  among major lenders and on select deals 
for all structured transactions in our mortgage insurance business  surveillance rates the performance of each transaction by modeling cash flows and providing detailed analysis 
results are then shared with management in a quarterly committee review meeting 
further responsibilities of portfolio management and risk analytics include economic research  presentations to our board of directors and assisting in financial reporting 

table of contents portfolio quality assurance our portfolio quality assurance pqa department is responsible for ensuring that credit and related risks that impact the quality of our portfolio of insured loans  the quality of loans underwritten by us or our delegated lenders and the quality of critical data used within our business are assessed  investigated and communicated to management so that informed decisions can be made about loss prevention  mitigation  corrective action  pricing and or other appropriate remedies 
the pqa group is responsible for ensuring that our underwriting procedures and guidelines as well as those of lenders and the gses are followed by service center  contract underwriting  and corporate operational support personnel through a loan re underwriting and auditing program 
the pqa group also conducts risk based reviews of our delegated underwriting business 
the results of our reviews are used to improve the quality of the business the lender submits to us for insurance 
issues that are raised in our reports and not resolved within a time period acceptable to us will result in restriction or termination of the lender s delegated underwriting authority 
the pqa group also identifies and recommends solutions for significant credit related data integrity issues that do not meet our expectations for accuracy  consistency  ease of use  or availability 
under a continuous improvement program  the pqa group works with the technology area to resolve these data issues 
the pqa group also is responsible for executing a program of risk based monitoring to evaluate the level of business channel and risk operations compliance with critical credit policies established by credit policy compliance  ensuring enforcement of credit policy and accountability on the part of the business channels and providing feedback to our credit policy department for continual review and improvement of existing policies 
due diligence on structured transactions we believe that understanding our business partners is a key component of managing the risks posed by potential business transactions 
due diligence is performed by the business channels under policies issued by our credit policy compliance group 
these due diligence reviews are precipitated either by a desire to develop an ongoing relationship with selected lenders  or by the submission of a proposed transaction by a given lender 
due diligence can take two forms business level and loan level 
our objective in business level due diligence is to understand the lender s business model in sufficient depth to determine whether we should have confidence in the lender as a potential long term business partner and customer 
business level due diligence may be performed on any prospective lender with whom a structured deal is contemplated and with whom we have had no recent business experience 
loan level due diligence is conducted on structured transactions i to determine whether appropriate underwriting guidelines have been adhered to and whether loans conform to our guidelines  ii to evaluate data integrity and iii to detect any fraudulent loans 
the results of loan level due diligence assist our mortgage insurance business in determining whether the pending transaction should be consummated and  in the event it is consummated  to provide data that can be used to determine appropriate pricing 
the results also provide the mortgage insurance business with a database of information on the quality of a particular lender s underwriting practices for future reference 
reinsurance ceded radian guaranty entered into variable quota share treaties in each of the years through to reinsure its primary risk originated in each of these years and a portion of its pool risk written in under these treaties  quota share loss relief is provided to radian guaranty at varying levels ranging from to 
table of contents based on the loss ratio on the reinsured book for a ten year term on each origination year 
the higher the loss ratio  the greater the potential reinsurance relief  which protects radian guaranty in adverse loss situations 
a commission is paid by the reinsurer to radian guaranty  and the agreements are noncancelable during their ten year terms by either party 
as of december   the risk in force covered by the variable quota share treaties was approximately billion  or approximately of our mortgage insurance business s total primary and pool risk in force  and million  or approximately of our mortgage insurance business s total pool risk in force on the remaining terms of the and origination years 
we have not reinsured any additional business pursuant to variable quota share treaties since in addition  radian guaranty currently uses reinsurance from affiliated companies to remain in compliance with the insurance regulations of states that require that a mortgage insurer limit its coverage percentage of any single risk to 
these transactions have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
radian guaranty and amerin guaranty are parties to a cross guaranty agreement 
this agreement provides that if either party fails to make a payment to any of its policyholders  then the other party will step in and make the payment 
the obligations of both parties under the agreement are unconditional and irrevocable  however  no payments will be made without prior approval by the insurance department of the payor s state of domicile 
in  we developed an approach for reinsuring our non prime risk 
the arrangement  which we refer to as smart home  effectively transfers risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
each transaction begins with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then enter into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer pursuant to which we agree to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of non prime residential mortgage loans insured by us 
the smart home reinsurer is funded in the capital markets through the issuance to investors of a series of separate classes of credit linked notes 
each class relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we typically retain the risk associated with the first loss coverage levels  and we may retain or sell  in a separate risk transfer agreement  the risk associated with the aaa rated or most remote coverage level 
holders of the smart home credit linked notes bear the risk of loss from losses paid to us under the reinsurance agreement 
the smart home reinsurer invests the proceeds of the notes in high quality short term investments approved by the rating agencies 
income earned on those investments and a portion of the reinsurance premiums that we pay are applied to pay interest on the notes as well as certain of the smart home reinsurer s expenses 
the rate of principal amortization of the credit linked notes approximates the rate of principal amortization of the underlying mortgages 
since august  we have completed three smart home arrangements 
details of these transactions are as follows date of transaction pool of non prime mortgages par value risk ceded to reinsurer par value notes sold to investors principal amount december billion billion million february billion million million august million million million million in principal amount of credit linked notes was issued in december an additional million in principal amount was issued in february smart home allows us to continue to take on more non prime risk and the higher premiums associated with insuring these types of products 
as a result  we consider smart home arrangements to be important to our ability to effectively manage our risk profile and to remain competitive in the non prime market 
approximately of our non prime risk in force is currently reinsured through smart home arrangements 
because the smart home arrangement ultimately depends on the willingness of investors to invest in smart home securities  we cannot be certain that smart home will always be available to us or will be available on terms that are acceptable 
table of contents to us 
if we are unable to continue to use smart home arrangements  our ability to participate in the non prime mortgage market could be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
premiums written ceded in and include million and million  respectively  related to the smart home transactions 
there were no ceded losses in or as a result of the smart home transactions 
we and other companies in the mortgage insurance industry also participate in reinsurance arrangements with mortgage lenders commonly referred to as captive reinsurance arrangements 
see mortgage insurance business captive reinsurance in this item financial guaranty we consider effective risk management to be critical to our long term financial stability and employ a comprehensive risk system 
this incorporates the integration of company wide risk management policies and processes as well as best practices of the financial guaranty industry 
all transactions are subject to a thorough underwriting analysis  a comprehensive risk committee decision process  and if a transaction is booked  surveillance by an independent department 
transaction underwriting includes the analysis of all credit and legal aspects as well as any specific risks that may be inherent in the transaction 
further  the financial guaranty business utilizes our proprietary internal economic capital model for risk analysis  valuation and as the basis for calculating raroc 
all transactions are subject to a credit committee decision process embedded in the business and governed by the erc 
following documented protocols and voting rules  a transaction must be approved in order to qualify for financial guaranty insurance 
for transactions that are approved and booked  responsibility transfers to the surveillance department for monitoring  review  feed back to underwriting and risk mitigation 
underwriting our financial guaranty underwriting discipline incorporates a multi discipline underwriting process for both direct transactions and reinsurance transactions 
direct transactions 
direct transactions are sourced and screened by the financial guaranty business based upon established criteria and profitability requirements 
transactions that qualify for further analysis are subject to an underwriting process to determine the creditworthiness of the obligor 
the underwriting analysis is performed at a transaction level  examining the fundamental ability and willingness of the obligor and or issuer to meet the specified obligation 
this analysis includes all aspects of the obligation ranging from the fundamental financial strength of the obligor to the structure of the transaction  which may dictate the payment structure 
all transaction analysis is also subject to legal requirements 
reinsurance transactions 
the same disciplined approach and risk requirements are applied to our reinsurance transactions 
as part of our ongoing business  the financial guaranty business assumes transactions from approved reinsurance companies on a treaty or facultative basis 
the primary insurance company is subject to a review by us that involves an examination of its operating  underwriting and surveillance procedures  personnel  organization and existing book of business 
additionally  our long standing relationships with these select companies provide for experience based analysis and information 
the treaty book of assumed business is governed by treaties  which specify the parameters of risk acceptance as well as other components 
the facultative business is governed by agreements between the primary insurer and us  and each transaction is subject to individual underwriting  as outlined above 
moreover  the ceding company typically is required to retain at least of the exposure on any single risk that we assume 
surveillance financial guaranty also has a surveillance risk management department that is dedicated to the surveillance of our book of business

as a result  we began offering mortgage insurance on increasing levels of non prime mortgages  as well as new and emerging products such as interest only loans and non traditional products such as second mortgages  credit default swaps  nims and insurance of international mortgage transactions 
because we have limited historical data regarding these products and transactions  we attempt to limit our exposure to these transactions until we can perform rigorous risk analytics and generate enough data to assist us in predicting the attendant risks and adjust our pricing accordingly 
we analyze our portfolio in a number of ways to identify any concentrations or imbalances in risk dispersion 
we believe the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio is affected significantly by the geographic dispersion of the properties securing the insured loans  the quality of loan originations  the characteristics of the loans insured including ltv  purpose of the loan  type of loan instrument and type of underlying property securing the loan  and the age of the loans insured 
primary risk in force by policy year the following table shows the percentage of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force by policy origination year as of december  and prior geographic dispersion the following tables show the percentage of direct primary mortgage insurance risk in force by location of property for the top states and top metropolitan statistical areas msas in the united states as of december  and december top ten states florida california texas new york georgia illinois ohio michigan arizona new jersey total

petersburg clearwater  fl total during  we increased the level of mortgage insurance business that we have been writing internationally 
we are now writing a product mix that varies according to location and includes mortgage insurance and reinsurance as well as credit enhancement for structured mortgage backed transactions and credit default swaps 
our primary geographical focus includes locations in europe  asia and australia 
we have provided credit protection on pools of mortgages including mortgage backed securities in credit default swap form in the uk  the netherlands  germany and denmark 
in addition  we entered into two mortgage reinsurance transactions in australia in and early in we ve also recently entered into a relationship with one of the largest mortgage lenders in hong kong to serve as its exclusive provider of mortgage insurance 
we are in the process of applying for branch authorization in hong kong 
lender and product characteristics although geographic dispersion is an important component of overall risk diversification our strategy has been to limit our exposure in the top states and top msas we believe the quality of the risk in force should be considered in conjunction with other elements of risk diversification such as product distribution and our risk management and underwriting practices 
one of the most important indicators of claim incidence is the relative amount of borrower s equity or down payment that exists in a home 
the expectation of claim incidence on mortgages with ltvs between and s is approximately two times the expected claim incidence on mortgages with ltvs between and s 
we believe that the higher premium rates we charge on s adequately reflect the additional risk on these loans 
we  along with the rest of our industry  have been insuring loans with ltvs between and s since and loans with an ltv of between and s since these loans are expected to have a higher claim incidence than s 
premium rates on s and s are higher than on s in an amount that we believe is commensurate with the additional risk and the higher expected frequency and severity of claims 
we also insure loans having an ltv over  although the amount that we insure is insignificant 
we believe that the risk of claim on non prime loans is significantly higher than that on prime loans 
although higher premium rates and surcharges are charged to compensate for the additional risk  non prime products are relatively new and have not been fully tested in adverse economic situations  so we cannot be certain that the premium rates we charge are adequate or that the loss performance will be at  or close to  expected levels 
our claim frequency on insured adjustable rate mortgages arms has been higher than on fixed rate loans due to monthly payment increases that occur when interest rates rise 

table of contents we believe that year mortgages are less risky than year mortgages  mainly as a result of the faster amortization and the more rapid accumulation of borrower equity in the property 
premium rates for year mortgages are lower to reflect the lower risk 
the risk of claim also is affected by the type of property securing the insured loan 
loans on single family detached housing are less likely to result in a claim than loans on other types of properties 
conversely  we generally consider loans on attached housing types  particularly condominiums and cooperatives  to be a higher risk due to the higher density of these properties 
our more stringent underwriting guidelines on condominiums and cooperatives reflect this higher expected risk 
we believe that the risk of claim on loans to borrowers who are relocating and loans originated by credit unions is low  and we offer lower premium rates on these loans commensurate with the lower risk 
we also believe that loans on non owner occupied homes purchased for investment purposes are more likely to result in a claim and are subject to greater value declines than loans on either primary or second homes 
accordingly  we underwrite loans on non owner occupied investment homes more stringently  and we charge a significantly higher premium rate than the rate charged for insuring loans on owner occupied homes 
it has been our experience that higher priced properties experience wider fluctuations in value than moderately priced residences and that the high incomes of many people who buy higher priced homes are less stable than those of people with moderate incomes 
underwriting guidelines for these higher priced properties reflect this concern 
in addition  we insure interest only mortgages  where the borrower pays only the interest charge on a mortgage for a specified period of time  usually five to ten years  after which the loan payment increases to include principal payments 
these loans may have a heightened propensity to default because of possible payment shocks after the initial low payment period expires and because the borrower does not automatically build equity as payments are made 
we also insure option arms  a product that has recently become very popular in the market 
option arms offer a number of different monthly payment options to the borrower 
one of these options is a minimum payment that is below the fully amortizing payment  which results in principal being added back to the loan balance and the loan balance continually increasing 
this process is referred to as negative amortization 
additional premiums are charged against these option arms as a result

the decrease between and reflects our decision to exit the trade credit reinsurance line of business 
customers mortgage insurance the principal customers of our mortgage insurance business are mortgage originators such as mortgage bankers  mortgage brokers  commercial banks and savings institutions 
this is the case even though individual mortgage borrowers generally incur the cost of primary mortgage insurance coverage 
we also offer lender paid mortgage insurance  in which the mortgage lender or loan servicer pays the mortgage insurance premiums 
the cost of the mortgage insurance is then passed on to the borrower in the form of higher interest rates 
in  approximately of our primary mortgage insurance was originated on a lender paid basis  compared to approximately in  much of which consisted of structured transactions 
this lender paid business is highly concentrated among a few large mortgage lending customers 
to obtain primary mortgage insurance from us  a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive a master policy 
our approval of a lender as a master policyholder is based  among other factors  on our evaluation of the lender s financial position and demonstrated adherence to sound loan origination practices 
our quality pqa function then monitors the master policyholder based on a number of criteria

financial guaranty our direct financial guaranty insurance customers consist of many of the major global financial institutions that structure  underwrite or trade securities issued in public finance and structured finance transactions 
these institutions typically are large commercial or investment banks that focus on high quality deals in the public finance and structured finance markets 
although we write financial guaranty insurance for obligations issued by or on behalf of many public finance and structured finance entities  these issuers are not our primary customers 
instead  the financial institutions underwriting or placing their securities generally are the ones who solicit the financial guaranty insurance for these transactions 
as a reinsurer of financial guaranty obligations  our financial guaranty business has maintained close and long standing relationships with most of the primary financial guaranty insurers 
we believe that these long term relationships provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the market and of the financial guaranty insurers underwriting guidelines and reinsurance needs 
our financial guaranty reinsurance customers consist mainly of the largest primary insurance companies licensed to write financial guaranty insurance and their foreign based affiliates  including ambac assurance corporation ambac  financial security assurance inc fsai and financial guaranty insurance company fgic 
primary trade credit insurers have also provided a significant portion of our financial guaranty insurance premiums in the past 
our financial guaranty segment derives a substantial portion of its premiums written from a small number of direct primary insurers 
in  one primary insurer accounted for million or of the financial guaranty segment s gross written premiums 
excluding the recapture in  two primary insurers accounted for million or of the financial guaranty segment s gross written premiums 
in  two primary insurers accounted for million or of the financial guaranty segment s gross written premiums

customers are grouped into the above categories and they are serviced by each of the four separate business units 
each channel has a business manager with profit and loss responsibility and accountability 
in addition  each channel has adopted a specific and focused approach to sustaining profitable growth 
there is a priority of maximizing return on capital  enhancing top line and bottom line growth  and an ongoing pursuit of achieving efficiencies through cost reductions and increased productivity 

table of contents business direct the business direct channel focuses on small and mid sized customers 
we employ a mortgage insurance field sales force of approximately persons  organized into two regions  that provides local sales representation throughout the united states 
each of the two regions is supervised by a divisional sales manager who is directly responsible for several regional sales managers 
the divisional sales managers are responsible for managing the profitability of business in their regions  including premiums  losses and expenses 
the regional sales managers are responsible for managing a small sales force in different areas within the region 
key account managers manage specific accounts within a region that are not national accounts  but need more targeted oversight and attention 
in addition to securing business from small and mid sized regional customers  the mortgage insurance business direct channel also provides field support for the large national accounts as necessary and appropriate 
strategic accounts in recognition of the continued consolidation in the mortgage lending business and  as a result  the significant share of business directed by large national accounts  we have a focused strategic accounts team consisting of seven strategic account managers and a dedicated risk operations manager that are directly and solely responsible for supporting strategic accounts 
each strategic account manager is responsible for a select group of accounts and is compensated based on the results for those accounts as well as our overall results 
there has been a trend among large national accounts to move to more centralized decision making about mortgage insurance that is subject to captive reinsurance relationships and other services provided by the mortgage insurance companies  such as streamlined electronic delivery and transfer of data between lenders and mortgage insurance companies 
included within the strategic accounts channel is a strategic account manager who is principally responsible for relationships and programs implemented with the gses 
strategic accounts business represented approximately of our primary new insurance written in  compared to in mortgage insurance sales personnel are compensated by salary  account profitability  commissions on new insurance written and a production incentive based on the achievement of various goals 
during  these goals were more focused on profitability and raroc 
capital markets our capital markets channel focuses on providing credit solutions for non prime collateral through five main products structured primary mortgage insurance  pool insurance  second lien mortgage insurance  financial guaranty of nims and credit default swaps 
the capital markets team works with investment banks  originators and whole loan aggregators to develop the most cost effective credit enhancement structure possible 
this ensures better access to the capital markets  and in turn  produces a lower cost of capital for our clients 
in order to provide the best customer service possible  the capital markets business operates a pricing desk that works in concert with its clients analysts  as well as transaction managers who shepherd particular deals through closing 
international the international mortgage channel is responsible for the development of mortgage opportunities outside the united states 
with teams located in london  hong kong and philadelphia  the international mortgage group develops and underwrites both mortgage insurance and capital market products 
the primary markets for international mortgage include europe  asia and australia 
the international mortgage group is comprised of professionals and works with mortgage lenders and originators  investment banks and other market intermediaries to identify market opportunities and credit risk management solutions 
financial guaranty our financial guaranty business develops its public finance business mainly through relationships with investment banks  commercial banks and financial advisors that provide financial and debt management services 
table of contents to  and intermediate transactions with  public finance borrowers 
we also have direct relationships with some issuers 
a dedicated public finance business development team  which reports directly to the head of our financial guaranty business s public finance group  markets directly to these intermediaries 
we do not pay or otherwise reimburse these intermediaries for their services 
our financial guaranty business originates its structured finance transaction flow principally by developing and maintaining strong relationships with the financial institutions  both in the united states and abroad  that are actively involved in the structured finance market 
our financial guaranty business develops its structured finance business through three primary business development units asset backed securities  cdos and financial solutions 
we have a dedicated structured finance business development team which reports directly to the head of our financial guaranty business s structured products group  for the purpose of developing new clients 
in addition  our financial guaranty business has a london based team of structured finance professionals responsible for sales and marketing for european structured finance transactions 
our financial guaranty reinsurance business markets directly to primary financial guaranty insurers that write credit enhancement business 
our financial guaranty business s goal is to meet the needs of the primary insurers  subject to our internal underwriting and risk management requirements 
we typically compensate primary financial guaranty insurers based on a percentage of premium assumed  which varies from agreement to agreement 
competition mortgage insurance we compete directly with six other private mortgage insurers genworth financial inc  mortgage guaranty insurance corporation  pmi mortgage insurance co  republic mortgage insurance company  triad guaranty insurance corporation and united guaranty corporation some of which are subsidiaries of well capitalized companies with stronger financial strength ratings and greater access to capital than we have 
we also compete against various federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the federal housing administration fha  the veterans administration va and state sponsored mortgage insurance funds 
the fha recently has increased its competitive position in areas with higher home prices by streamlining its down payment formula and reducing the premiums it charges 
governmental and quasi governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have  and therefore  may have financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
in the event that a government owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets determines to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit motive  we may be unable to compete in that market effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we compete for flow business with other private mortgage insurance companies more on the basis of service than on the basis of price 
this service based competition includes risk management services  loss mitigation efforts and management and field service organization and expertise 
we also provide contract underwriting services and participate in arrangements such as captive reinsurance and affordable housing programs 
we cede a significant portion of our mortgage insurance business to mortgage insurance companies through captive reinsurance arrangements 
premiums ceded to captive reinsurance companies in were million  representing of our total direct mortgage insurance premiums earned during historically  these arrangements have reduced the profitability and return on capital in our mortgage insurance business 
we also face competition from an increasing number of alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance  including mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  mostly through loans or other forms of simultaneous second loans 
the use of simultaneous second loans has increased significantly during recent years and is likely to continue to be a competitive alternative to private mortgage insurance  
table of contents investors using other forms of credit enhancement such as credit default swaps or securitizations as a partial or complete substitute for private mortgage insurance  and mortgage lenders and other intermediaries that forego third party insurance coverage and retain the full risk of loss on their high ltv loans 
much of the competition described above is directed at prime loans  which has led us to shift more of our business to insuring riskier  non prime loans 
we compete for structured transactions with other mortgage insurers as well as capital market executions such as senior subordinated security structures 
competition for this business generally is based both on price and on the percentage of a given pool of loans that we are willing to insure 
financial guaranty we are subject to competition from companies that specialize in financial guaranty insurance or reinsurance  including mbia insurance corporation  ambac  fgic  fsai  assured guaranty corp  cdc ixis financial guaranty  xl capital assurance inc  xl financial assurance ltd 
and ram reinsurance company 
in the late s  several multiline insurers increased their participation in financial guaranty reinsurance 
the participation of multiline insurers in the financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance businesses has decreased due to the downgrade of certain of these multiline participants 
certain of these multiline insurers have formed strategic alliances with some of the us primary financial guaranty insurers 
we believe that competition from multiline reinsurers and new monoline financial guaranty insurers will continue to be limited due to a the lack of consistent dedication to the business from multiline insurers with the required financial strength  and b the barriers to entry for new reinsurers posed by state insurance law and rating agency criteria governing minimum capitalization 
competition in the financial guaranty reinsurance business is based on many factors  including overall financial strength  financial strength ratings  pricing and service 
the rating agencies allow credit to a ceding company s capital requirements and single risk limits for reinsurance that is ceded 
the amount of this credit is in part determined by the financial strength rating of the reinsurer 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have and are better capitalized than we are and or have been assigned higher ratings by one or more of the major rating agencies 
in addition  the rating agencies could change the level of credit they will allow a ceding company to take for amounts ceded to us and or similarly rated reinsurers 
the majority of insured public finance and structured finance transactions are guaranteed by triple a rated financial guaranty insurers 
as a aa aa rated company  our financial guaranty business mainly targets distinct niches in the capital markets 
there is generally a greater interest cost savings to an issuer by using triple a rated credit enhancement as compared to our aa aa rated credit enhancement 
however  financial guaranty insurance provided by a lower rated provider also can provide significant value over uninsured executions in markets where the triple a rated financial guaranty insurance is unavailable or uneconomical 
in some markets  issuers and other counterparties receive no additional rating agency credit or regulatory relief from triple a rated enhancement than they do with our aa aa enhancement  so our enhancement in these markets may be more economical 
our financial guaranty insurance business also competes with other forms of credit enhancement  including letters of credit  guaranties and credit default swaps provided in most cases by banks and other financial institutions  some of which are governmental entities or have been assigned the highest credit ratings awarded by one or more of the major rating agencies 
most of these forms of credit enhancement  however  serve to provide ceding companies with increased insurance capacity only for rating agency purposes 
unlike financial guaranty reinsurance  most do not qualify as capital for state regulatory purposes  nor do they constitute credit against specific liabilities that would allow the ceding company greater single risk capacity 
in late  however  the 
table of contents laws applicable to those ceding companies domiciled in new york were amended to permit such ceding companies to use certain credit default swaps meeting applicable requirements as collateral to offset statutory single limits  aggregate risk limits  aggregate net liability calculations and contingency reserve requirements 
this regulatory change  which makes credit default swaps an attractive alternative to traditional financial guaranty insurance  may result in a reduced demand for traditional monoline financial guaranty reinsurance 
we also face competition from alternate transaction structures that permit issuers to securitize assets more cost effectively without the need for other credit enhancement and from cash rich investors seeking additional yield on their investments by foregoing credit enhancement 
we are also seeing increased competition in our financial guaranty reinsurance business as a result of captive reinsurance arrangements involving our financial guaranty primary reinsurance customers 
ratings s p  moody s and fitch each rate the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries 
the rating agencies focus on the following factors capital resources  financial strength  commitment of management to  and alignment of stockholder interests with  the insurance business  demonstrated management expertise in our insurance business  credit analysis  systems development  risk management  marketing  capital markets and investment operations  including the ability to raise additional capital  and a minimum policyholders surplus with initial capital sufficient to meet projected growth as well as access to additional capital as may be necessary to continue to meet standards for capital adequacy 
as part of their rating process  s p  moody s and fitch could test our insurance subsidiaries by subjecting them to a stress level scenario in which losses over a stress period are tested against our capital level 
the financial strength rating assigned by the rating agencies to an insurance or reinsurance company is based on factors relevant to policyholders and is not intended to the protect the equity holders of such company 
a financial strength rating is neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security 
financial strength ratings are an indication to an insurer s customers of the insurer s present financial strength and its capacity to honor its future claims payment obligations 
therefore  ratings generally are considered critical to an insurer s ability to compete for new insurance business 
the financial strength rating assigned to our insurance subsidiaries should not be viewed as indicative of or relevant to any ratings that may be assigned to our outstanding debt securities by any rating agency and should not be considered an evaluation of the likelihood of timely payment of principal or interest on those securities 
we have been assigned a senior debt rating of a by fitch  a by s p and a by moody s 
our principal insurance subsidiaries have been assigned the following financial strength ratings moody s moody s outlook s p s p outlook fitch fitch outlook radian guaranty aa stable aa stable aa stable radian insurance aa stable aa stable aa stable amerin guaranty aa stable aa stable aa stable radian asset assurance aa stable aa negative aa negative radian asset assurance limited aa negative aa negative moody s and s p have entered into an agreement with radian guaranty that obligates radian guaranty to maintain at least million of capital in radian insurance as a condition of the issuance and maintenance of radian insurance s ratings 
in february  we submitted a request to the insurance department of pennsylvania to contribute approximately million in capital from radian guaranty to radian insurance to support the additional risk that has been written in that entity  principally through non traditional mortgage insurance transactions by our capital markets and international channels 

table of contents on april   fitch affirmed the aa insurance financial strength rating of radian asset assurance and raal  a subsidiary of radian asset assurance that is authorized to conduct insurance business in the uk  but revised its ratings outlook for the two entities to negative from stable 
fitch s ratings for us and our other rated subsidiaries are unchanged 
none of the primary insurance customers of our financial guaranty business have any recapture rights as a result of this ratings action by fitch 
in october  s p downgraded the insurer financial strength rating of radian reinsurance from aaa to aa 
as a result of this downgrade  effective january   one of the primary insurer customers of our financial guaranty reinsurance business exercised its right to recapture approximately billion of par in force ceded to our financial guaranty reinsurance business  including million of net premiums written with a gaap carrying value of approximately million 
the entire impact of this recapture was reflected as a reduction of net premiums written in the first quarter of because  in accordance with gaap  we already had reflected million of these recaptured net premiums written as having been earned  we were required to record the entire million reduction in net premiums earned in the first quarter of also in connection with the recapture in the first quarter of  we were reimbursed for policy acquisition costs of approximately million for which the carrying value under gaap was million 
in addition  the recapture included approximately million that had been recorded as case reserves under gaap 
finally  we took a charge of million for mark to market adjustments related to certain insurance policies associated with the recapture 
the sum of the above adjustments related to this recapture resulted in an immediate reduction of pre tax income of million 
we estimate that the recapture of reinsurance business reduced pre tax income by approximately million or approximately per share after tax  per share of which was a result of the immediate impact of the recapture  and the balance was a result of recaptured net premiums written that would have been earned over time  and estimated losses 
the sum of the above adjustments related to this recapture is summarized as follows cash paid received gaap book basis initial gain loss in thousands unearned premium acquisition costs case reserves receivable from unrealized credit derivatives gain totals without cost to or concessions by us  the remaining primary insurer customers with recapture rights agreed not to exercise those rights with respect to the october downgrade by s p

effective february   one of these customers recaptured approximately billion of par in force that it had ceded to us  including million of written premiums as of february   million of which was recorded as an immediate reduction of premiums earned at the time of the recapture  which represents the difference between statutory and gaap unearned premiums 
this return of unearned premiums 
table of contents resulted in an increase in policy acquisition costs of million 
the aggregate was a reduction in pre tax income of million  or approximately per share after tax on a gaap basis 
the amount of future lost premiums due to this recapture will be approximately million  which consists of the unearned premium balance and the value of future installment premiums 
based on the february   recapture date  the total approximate reduction in pre tax income for  including the immediate impact  was approximately million or approximately per share after tax 
the sum of the above adjustments related to this recapture is summarized as follows cash paid received gaap book basis initial loss in thousands unearned premiums acquisition costs total despite the recapture  this primary insurer customer renewed its reinsurance treaty with us for  and again recently for  on substantially the same terms as in  prior to the may downgrade

table of contents regulation state regulation we and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive  detailed regulation principally designed for the protection of policyholders  rather than for the benefit of investors  by the insurance departments in the various states where we and our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business 
insurance laws vary from state to state  but generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or officials to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business

each insurance subsidiary is required by its state of domicile and each other jurisdiction in which it is licensed to transact business to make various filings with those jurisdictions and with the national association of insurance commissioners  including quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
insurance holding company regulation 
we are an insurance holding company and our insurance subsidiaries belong to an insurance holding company system 
all states have enacted legislation regulating insurance companies in an insurance holding company system 
these laws generally require each insurance company in the system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and to furnish to this regulator financial and other information concerning the operations of companies within the system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of insurers within the system 
because we are an insurance holding company  and because radian guaranty and radian insurance are pennsylvania insurance companies  amerin guaranty is an illinois insurance company  and radian asset assurance is a new york insurance company  the pennsylvania  illinois or new york insurance laws regulate  among other things  certain transactions in our common stock and certain transactions between us  our insurance subsidiaries and other parties affiliated with us 
specifically  no person may  directly or indirectly  offer to acquire or acquire control of us or our insurance subsidiaries  unless that person files a statement and other documents with the commissioner of insurance of the state in which the target company is domiciled and obtains the commissioner s prior approval 
the commissioner may hold a public hearing on the matter 
control is presumed to exist if or more of the target company s voting securities are owned or controlled  directly or indirectly  by a person  although control may or may not be deemed to exist where a person owns or controls a lesser amount of securities 
in addition  material transactions between us  our insurance subsidiaries and our affiliates are subject to certain conditions  including that they be fair and reasonable 
these restrictions generally apply to all persons controlling or under common control with us or our insurance subsidiaries 
certain transactions between us  our insurance subsidiaries or our affiliates may not be entered into unless the relevant commissioner of insurance is given days prior notification and does not disapprove the transaction during that day period 
dividends 
radian guaranty s and radian insurance s ability to pay dividends on their common stock is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  their state of domicile 
the insurance laws of pennsylvania establish a test limiting the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval by the pennsylvania insurance commissioner 
under this test  an insurer may pay dividends during any month period in an amount equal to the greater of i of the preceding year end statutory policyholders surplus  or ii the preceding year s statutory net income 
in accordance with this test  million and million would be available for dividends from radian guaranty and radian insurance  respectively  in however  another provision of the pennsylvania insurance laws provides that dividends and other distributions may only be paid out of an insurer s unassigned surplus unless the pennsylvania insurance commissioner approves additional dividends 
radian guaranty and radian insurance had positive unassigned surplus at december  of million and million  respectively 
the pennsylvania insurance commissioner has approved all distributions by radian guaranty since the enactment of this insurance law provision 
radian insurance has not paid any dividends to radian guaranty  its immediate parent company 

table of contents amerin guaranty s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of the state of illinois  its state of domicile 
the insurance laws of illinois establish a test limiting the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid from unassigned surplus by an insurer without prior approval by the illinois insurance commissioner 
under this test  amerin guaranty may pay dividends during any month period in an amount equal to the greater of i of the preceding year end statutory policyholders surplus  or ii the preceding year s statutory net income 
in accordance with this test  million would be available for dividends in without prior regulatory approval 
in january  amerin paid a million dividend to us that was declared in december  after receiving approval for a special dividend from the illinois insurance commissioner 
radian asset assurance s ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of the state of new york  its state of domicile 
under the new york insurance law  radian asset assurance may only declare or distribute dividends from earned surplus 
unless the company has prior approval from the new york superintendent of insurance  the company can only pay a dividend  which when totaled with all other dividends declared or distributed by it during the next preceding twelve months  is the lesser of ten percent of its surplus to policyholders as shown by its last statement on file with the superintendent  or one hundred percent of adjusted net investment income 
at december   radian asset assurance had million available for dividends that could be paid in without prior approval 
radian asset assurance paid a million dividend to us in risk to capital 
a number of states limit a private mortgage insurer s risk in force to times the total of the insurer s policyholders surplus plus the statutory contingency reserve  commonly known as the risk to capital requirement 
as of december   the consolidated risk to capital ratio for our mortgage insurance business was to compared to to as of december  the cross guaranty agreement between radian guaranty and amerin guaranty makes it appropriate to look at risk to capital on a combined basis 
reserves 
for statutory reporting  mortgage insurance companies are required annually to provide for additions to their contingency reserve in an amount equal to of earned premiums 
such amounts cannot be withdrawn for a period of years except under certain circumstances 
the contingency reserve  designed to be a reserve against catastrophic losses  essentially restricts dividends and other distributions by mortgage insurance companies 
we classify the contingency reserve as a statutory liability 
at december   radian guaranty had statutory policyholders surplus of million and a contingency reserve of billion  amerin guaranty had statutory policyholders surplus of million and a contingency reserve of million and radian insurance had statutory policyholders surplus of million and a contingency reserve of million 
in accordance with new york insurance law  our financial guaranty business must establish a contingency reserve  in an amount equal to the greater of of premiums written or a stated percentage of the principal guaranteed  ratably over to years depending on the category of obligation insured 
reinsurers are required to establish a contingency reserve equal to their proportionate share of the reserve established by the ceding company 
at december   radian asset assurance had statutory policyholders surplus of million and a contingency reserve of million 
premium rates and policy forms 
each of our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty subsidiary s premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which it is licensed to transact business 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace 
in most states  premium rates and policy forms must be filed and  in some states approved  before their use 
changes in premium rates may be subject to justification  generally on the basis of the insurer s loss experience  expenses and future trend analysis 
the general default experience in the mortgage insurance industry also may be considered 

table of contents reinsurance 
restrictions apply under the laws of several states to any licensed company ceding business to an unlicensed reinsurer 
under those laws  if a reinsurer is not admitted  authorized or approved in such state  the company ceding business to the reinsurer cannot take credit in its statutory financial statements for the risk ceded to the reinsurer absent compliance with certain reinsurance security requirements 
in addition  several states also have special restrictions on mortgage insurance  and several states limit the amount of risk a mortgage insurer may retain with respect to coverage on an insured loan to of the insured s claim amount 
coverage in excess of ie  deep coverage must be reinsured 
examination 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination of their affairs by the insurance departments of each of the states in which they are licensed to transact business 
accreditation 
the national association of insurance commissioners instituted the financial regulatory accreditation standards program  known as frasp  in response to federal initiatives to regulate the business of insurance 
frasp provides standards intended to establish effective state regulation of the financial condition of insurance companies 
frasp requires states to adopt certain laws and regulations  institute required regulatory practices and procedures  and have adequate personnel to enforce these items in order to become accredited 
in accordance with the national association of insurance commissioners model law on examinations  accredited states are not permitted to accept certain financial examination reports of insurers prepared solely by the insurance regulatory agency in states not accredited by january  although the state of new york is not accredited  no state where radian asset assurance is licensed has refused to accept the new york insurance department s reports on examination for radian asset assurance 
however  we cannot be certain that  if the new york insurance department remains unaccredited  other states that are accredited will continue to accept financial examination reports prepared solely by new york 
we do not believe that the refusal by an accredited state to continue accepting financial examination reports prepared by new york would have a material adverse impact on our insurance businesses 
federal regulation respa 
the origination or refinance of a federally regulated mortgage loan is a settlement service  and therefore  subject to respa 
in december  regulations were issued stating that mortgage insurance also is a settlement service 
as a result  mortgage insurers are subject to the anti referral provisions of section a of respa  which provide  in essence  that that mortgage insurers are prohibited from paying anything of value to a mortgage lender in consideration of the lender s referral of business to the mortgage insurer 
although many states prohibit mortgage insurers from giving rebates  respa has been interpreted to cover many non fee services as well 
the us department of housing and urban development s hud interest in pursuing violations of respa has increased the awareness of both mortgage insurers and their customers of the possible sanctions resulting from a violation of respa 
hud  as well as the insurance commissioner or an attorney general of any state  may conduct investigations  levy fines and other sanctions or enjoin future violations of respa 
we and other mortgage insurers have faced private lawsuits alleging  among other things  that our captive reinsurance arrangements  as well as pool insurance and contract underwriting services  constitute unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under respa 
although to date we have successfully defended against all such lawsuits on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing  we cannot be certain that we will have continued success defending against similar lawsuits 
the insurance law provisions of many states  including new york  also prohibit paying for the referral of insurance business and provide various mechanisms to enforce this provision 
in february  the new york insurance department issued circular letter no 
that discusses its position concerning various transactions between mortgage guaranty insurance companies licensed in new york and mortgage lenders 
the letter confirms that captive reinsurance transactions are permissible if they constitute a legitimate transfer of risk and are fair and equitable to the parties 
the letter also states that supernotes performance notes  dollar pool insurance  and un captive captives violate new york insurance law 
in may  we received a letter from the new york insurance department seeking information related to all of the captive mortgage reinsurance 
table of contents arrangements that we entered into since january   a list of the lenders associated with each captive along with each captive s state of domicile and capital surplus requirements 
the letter also included a request for a description of any other arrangements through which we provide any payment or consideration to a lender in connection with mortgage insurance 
we submitted our response and affirmed it as true under penalties of perjury to the new york insurance department by june  we are aware that other mortgage insurers have received similar requests from the new york insurance department 
in february  we and other mortgage insurers received a second letter from the new york insurance department seeking documentation and a description of the due diligence that we perform in selecting reinsurers for our mortgage insurance risk 
the letter indicates that the new york insurance department is seeking evidence from us to rebut the assertion that the premiums we pay under our captive reinsurance arrangements constitute an inducement or compensation to lenders for doing business with us and to bolster a claim that it is difficult or impossible to obtain mortgage reinsurance from non captive reinsurers 
we are considering our response to this request  which we intend to submit to the new york insurance department as requested 
in addition to the new york inquiry  other mortgage insurers recently have received subpeonas from the minnesota insurance commissioner relating to their captive reinsurer arrangements  and public reports have indicated that both the colorado and north carolina insurance commissioners were considering investigating or reviewing captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements 
insurance departments or other officials in other states may also conduct such investigations or reviews 
although we believe that all of our captive reinsurance arrangements transfer risk to the captive reinsurer at a premium rate that is commensurate with the risk  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend against any alleged violations of respa or other laws 
hud proposed a rule under respa to create an exemption from section a of respa 
the proposed rule would have made the exemption available to lenders that  at the time a borrower submits a loan application  give the borrower a firm  guaranteed price for all the settlement services associated with the loan  commonly referred to as bundling 
in  hud withdrew the proposed rule and submitted another proposed rule to the office of management and budget  which also was subsequently withdrawn 
if bundling is exempted from respa  mortgage lenders may have increased leverage over us and the premiums we are able to charge for mortgage insurance could be negatively affected 
hmda 
most originators of mortgage loans are required to collect and report data relating to a mortgage loan applicant s race  nationality  gender  marital status and census tract to hud or the federal reserve under the home mortgage disclosure act of hmda 
the purpose of the hmda is to detect possible discrimination in home lending and  through disclosure  to discourage this discrimination 
mortgage insurers are not required pursuant to any law or regulation to report hmda data  although under the laws of several states  mortgage insurers are currently prohibited from discriminating on the basis of certain classifications 
several mortgage insurers  through their trade association  mortgage insurance companies of america mica  entered into an agreement with the federal financial institutions examinations council ffiec to report the same data on loans submitted for insurance as is required for most mortgage lenders under hmda 
reports of hmda type data for the mortgage insurance industry have been submitted by several mortgage insurers through mica to the ffiec since we are not aware of any pending or expected actions by governmental agencies in response to the reports submitted by mica to the ffiec 
since january  we have been independently reporting hmda data to the ffiec  due to our withdrawal from mica 
mortgage insurance cancellation 
the homeowners protection act of the hpa was signed into law on july  the hpa imposes certain cancellation and termination requirements for borrower paid private mortgage insurance and requires certain disclosures to borrowers regarding their rights under the law 
the hpa also requires certain disclosures for loans covered by lender paid private mortgage insurance 
specifically  the hpa provides that private mortgage insurance on most loans originated on or after july   may be 
table of contents canceled at the request of the borrower once the ltv reaches  provided that certain conditions are satisfied 
private mortgage insurance must be canceled automatically once the ltv reaches or  if the loan is not current on that date  on the date that the loan becomes current 
the hpa establishes special rules for the termination of private mortgage insurance in connection with loans that are high risk 
the hpa does not define high risk loans but leaves that determination to fannie mae and freddie mac for loans up to the conforming loan limit and to the mortgagee for any other loan 
for high risk loans above the conforming loan limit  private mortgage insurance must be terminated on the date that the ltv is first scheduled to reach 
in no case  however  may private mortgage insurance be required beyond the midpoint of the amortization period of the loan if the mortgagor is current on the payments required by the terms of the mortgage 
we do not believe that the hpa has had a material impact on the persistency rate of our insured loans or on our financial results 
freddie mac and fannie mae as the largest purchasers and sellers of conventional mortgage loans  and therefore beneficiaries of private mortgage insurance  freddie mac and fannie mae impose requirements on private mortgage insurers so that they may be eligible to insure loans sold to freddie mac and fannie mae 
freddie mac s current eligibility requirements impose limitations on the type of risk insured  standards for the geographic and customer diversification of risk  procedures for claims handling  standards for acceptable underwriting practices  standards for certain reinsurance cessions and financial requirements that generally mirror state insurance regulatory requirements 
these requirements are subject to change from time to time 
fannie mae also has eligibility requirements  although those requirements are not published 
radian guaranty is an approved first lien mortgage insurer for both freddie mac and fannie mae 
in january  fannie mae announced a program that allows for lower levels of required mortgage insurance coverage for low down payment year fixed rate loans approved through its desktop underwriter automated underwriting system 
under this program  fannie mae replaces some of the mortgage insurance coverage with a layer of investor mortgage insurance coverage provided by at least two mortgage insurers 
the office of federal housing enterprise oversight issued new risk based capital regulations for freddie mac and fannie mae  which took effect september  the most relevant provision to us is a distinction between aaa rated insurers and aa rated insurers 
the new regulations impose a lesser credit reduction for fannie mae and freddie mac for exposure ceded by them to aaa rated insurers as compared to aa rated insurers 
currently  radian guaranty is rated aa  one other mortgage insurance provider is rated aaa 
as a result  there may be an incentive for the gses to prefer private mortgage insurance provided by the aaa rated insurer  although this has not occurred to this point 
the provisions of the new regulations are to be phased in over a year period commencing on the effective date of the regulation 
fannie mae and freddie mac require that we participate in affordable housing programs that they maintain to provide for loans to low and moderate income borrowers 
these programs usually include s  s and s  and may require the liberalization of certain underwriting guidelines to achieve the programs objectives 
our default experience on loans that we insure through these programs has been worse than on non affordable housing loans  but our participation in these programs does not comprise a material amount of our risk in force 
indirect regulation we also are indirectly  but significantly  impacted by regulations affecting originators and purchasers of mortgage loans  such as freddie mac and fannie mae  and regulations affecting governmental insurers such as the fha and the va 
we and other private mortgage insurers may be significantly impacted by federal housing legislation and other laws and regulations that affect the demand for private mortgage insurance and the housing market generally 
for example  legislation that increases the number of persons eligible for fha or va mortgages could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with the fha or va 

table of contents the fha single family loan limits were raised effective january  the limits range from  in low cost areas to  in high cost areas 
the limits were increased to a range from  to  effective january  we do not believe that demand for private mortgage insurance has been or will be materially adversely affected by this change 
foreign regulation we also are subject to certain regulation in various foreign countries  namely the uk and bermuda  as a result of our operations in those jurisdictions 
in the uk  we are subject to regulation by the financial services authority  or fsa 
the fsa periodically performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups carrying on business in the uk after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile 
this will include details of any remedial action that the fsa requires 
the fsa also supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  by which any appointment of persons to perform certain specified controlled functions within a regulated entity  must be approved by the fsa 
in addition  the fsa recently began to supervise the sale of general insurance  including payment protection insurance and mortgage insurance 
under fsa rules  persons who are involved in the sale of general insurance including insurers and distributors are prohibited from offering or accepting any inducement in connection with the sale of general insurance that is likely to conflict materially with their duties to insureds 
although the rules do not generally require disclosure of broker compensation  the insurer or distributor must disclose broker compensation at the insured s request 
the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an insurance company or authorized person and has the power  among other things  to enforce  and take disciplinary measures in respect of  breaches of its rules 
under fsa rules  insurance companies must maintain a margin of solvency at all times  the calculation of which in any particular case depends on the type and amount of insurance business a company writes 
our uk subsidiaries are prohibited from declaring a dividend to their shareholders unless they have profits available for distribution 
the determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses 
the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company will require fsa approval 
for these purposes  a party that controls a uk insurance company includes any company or individual that together with its or his associates directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company 
in considering whether to approve an application for approval  the fsa must be satisfied that the acquirer is both a fit and proper person to have such control and that the interests of consumers would not be threatened by such acquisition of control 
failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against our uk subsidiaries by the fsa 
employees at december   we had  employees  of which approximately are located in our philadelphia  pennsylvania headquarters facility and approximately are located in field offices throughout the united states 
approximately of our employees work in our financial guaranty business located in new york city and london 
approximately of our employees are contract underwriters that are hired on an as needed basis 
the number of contract underwriters can vary substantially from period to period  mainly as a result of changes in the demand for these services 
our employees are not unionized and management considers employee relations to be good 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
risks affecting our company deterioration in general economic factors may increase our loss experience and decrease demand for mortgage insurance and financial guaranties 
our business tends to be cyclical and tends to track general economic and market conditions 
our loss experience on the mortgage and financial guaranty insurance we write is subject to general economic factors that are beyond our control  many of which we cannot anticipate  including extended national economic recessions  interest rate changes or volatility  business failures  the impact of terrorist attacks or acts of war  or changes in investor perceptions regarding the strength of private mortgage insurers or financial guaranty providers and the policies or guaranties they offer 
deterioration of general economic conditions  such as increasing unemployment rates  negatively affects our mortgage insurance business by increasing the likelihood that borrowers will not pay their mortgages 
personal factors affecting individual borrowers  such as divorce or illness  also impact the ability of borrowers to continue to pay their mortgages 
depreciation of home prices also is a leading indication of an increase in our future losses 
our financial guaranty business also is impacted by adverse economic conditions due to the impact or perceived impact these conditions may have on the credit quality of municipalities and corporations 
the same events that increase our loss experience in each business also generally lead to decreased activity in the market for mortgages and financial obligations  leading to decreased demand for our mortgage insurance or financial guaranties 
an increase in our loss experience or a decrease in demand for our products due to adverse economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
deterioration in regional economic factors could increase our losses or reduce demand for our insurance 
we could be affected by weakening economic conditions  catastrophic events  or acts of terrorism in specific regions of the united states where our business is concentrated 
a majority of our primary mortgage insurance in force is concentrated in ten states  with the highest percentage being in florida  california  texas and new york 
a large percentage of our second lien mortgage insurance in force is concentrated in california and florida 
our financial guaranty business also has a significant portion of its insurance in force concentrated in a small number of states  principally including california  new york  texas  pennsylvania and florida 
a continued and prolonged weakening of economic conditions  declines in home price appreciation or catastrophic events or acts of terrorism in the states where our business is concentrated could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings or the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to any of our operating subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position and affect our financial condition 
the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to our subsidiaries may be downgraded by one or more of s p  moody s or fitch if they believe that we or the applicable subsidiary has experienced adverse developments in our business  financial condition or operating results 
these ratings are important to our ability to market our products and to maintain our competitive position and customer confidence in our products 
a downgrade in these ratings  or the announcement of a potential for a downgrade  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our principal operating subsidiaries had been assigned the following ratings as of the date of this report moody s moody s outlook s p s p outlook fitch fitch outlook radian guaranty aa stable aa stable aa stable radian insurance aa stable aa stable aa stable amerin guaranty aa stable aa stable aa stable radian asset assurance aa stable aa negative aa negative radian asset assurance limited aa negative aa negative 
table of contents if the financial strength ratings assigned to any of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries were to fall below aa from moody s or the aa level from s p and fitch  then national mortgage lenders and a large segment of the mortgage securitization market  including fannie mae and freddie mac  generally would not purchase mortgages or mortgage backed securities insured by that subsidiary 
any downgrade of the ratings assigned to our financial guaranty subsidiaries would limit the desirability of their respective direct insurance products and would reduce the value of radian asset assurance s reinsurance  even to the point where primary insurers may be unwilling to continue to cede insurance to radian asset assurance at attractive rates 
in addition  many of radian asset assurance s reinsurance agreements give the primary insurers the right to recapture business ceded to radian asset assurance under these agreements  and in some cases  the right to increase commissions charged to radian asset assurance if radian asset assurance s insurance financial strength rating is downgraded below specified levels 
accordingly  radian asset assurance s competitive position and prospects for future financial guaranty reinsurance opportunities would be damaged by a downgrade in its ratings 
for example  downgrades that occurred in october and in may triggered these recapture rights 
see ratings in item for more information regarding these downgrades 
we cannot be certain that the impact on our business of any future downgrades would not be worse than the impact resulting from these prior downgrades 
in addition to the financial strength ratings assigned to our subsidiaries  we have been assigned a senior debt rating of a by fitch  a by s p and a by moody s 
the credit ratings generally impact the interest rates that we pay on money that we borrow 
therefore  a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing which would have an adverse affect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
an increase in our subsidiaries risk to capital or leverage ratios may prevent them from writing new insurance 
rating agencies and state insurance regulators impose capital requirements on our subsidiaries 
these capital requirements include risk to capital ratios  leverage ratios and surplus requirements that limit the amount of insurance that these subsidiaries may write 
for example  moody s and s p have entered into an agreement with radian guaranty that obligates radian guaranty to maintain specified levels of capital in radian insurance as a condition of the issuance and maintenance of radian insurance s ratings 
a material reduction in the statutory capital and surplus of any of our subsidiaries  whether resulting from underwriting or investment losses or otherwise  or a disproportionate increase in risk in force  could increase that subsidiary s risk to capital ratio or leverage ratio 
this in turn could limit that subsidiary s ability to write new business or require that subsidiary to lower its ratios by obtaining capital contributions from us  reinsuring existing business or reducing the amount of new business it writes  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
if the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance or financial guaranty business are incorrect  we may be required to take unexpected charges to income and our ratings may be lowered 
we establish loss reserves in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses to provide for the estimated cost of claims 
however  our loss reserves may be inadequate to protect us from the full amount of claims we may have to pay 
setting our loss reserves involves significant reliance on estimates of the likelihood  magnitude and timing of anticipated losses 
the models and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may prove to be inaccurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
further  if our estimates are inadequate  we may be forced by insurance and other regulators or rating agencies to increase our reserves  which could result in a downgrade of the insurance financial strength ratings assigned to our operating subsidiaries 
failure to establish adequate reserves or a requirement that we increase our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in our mortgage insurance business  in accordance with gaap  we generally do not establish reserves until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two payments when due 
upon notification that two 
table of contents payments have been missed  we establish a loss reserve by using historical models based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by the servicer of the loan  economic conditions  the estimated amount recoverable by foreclosure and the estimated foreclosure period in the area where a default exists 
these reserves are therefore based on a number of assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate 
it is even more difficult to estimate the appropriate loss reserves for our financial guaranty business because of the nature of potential losses in that business 
we establish both case and non specific reserves for losses 
we increase case reserves when we determine that a default has occurred 
we also establish non specific reserves to reflect deterioration of our insured credits for which we have not provided specific reserves 
in january and february of  we discussed with the sec staff  both separately and together with other members of the financial guaranty industry  the differences in loss reserve practices followed by different financial guaranty industry participants 
on june   the fasb added a project to its agenda to consider the accounting by insurers for financial guaranty insurance 
the fasb will consider several aspects of the insurance accounting model  including claims liability recognition  premium recognition and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
in addition  we also understand that the fasb may expand the scope of this project to include income recognition and loss reserving methodology in the mortgage insurance industry 
proposed and final guidance from the fasb regarding accounting for financial guaranty insurance is expected to be issued in when and if the fasb or the sec reaches a conclusion on these issues  we and the rest of the financial guaranty and mortgage insurance industries may be required to change some aspects of our accounting policies 
if the fasb or the sec were to determine that we should account for our financial guaranty contracts differently  for example by requiring them to be treated solely as one or the other of short duration or long duration contracts under sfas no 
 this determination could impact our accounting for loss reserves  premium revenue and deferred acquisition costs  all of which are covered by sfas no 
management is unable to estimate what impact  if any  the ultimate resolution of this issue will have on our financial condition or operating results 
our success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks 
our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty premium rates may not adequately cover future losses 
our mortgage insurance premiums are based upon our expected risk of claims on insured loans  and take into account  among other factors  each loan s ltv  type eg  prime vs 
non prime or fixed vs 
variable payments  term  occupancy status and coverage percentage 
similarly  our financial guaranty premiums are based upon our expected risk of claim on the insured obligation  and take into account  among other factors  the rating and creditworthiness of the issuer of the insured obligations  the type of insured obligation  the policy term and the structure of the transaction being insured 
in addition  our premium rates take into account expected cancellation rates  operating expenses and reinsurance costs  as well as profit and capital needs and the prices that we expect our competitors to offer 
we generally cannot cancel or elect not to renew the mortgage insurance or financial guaranty insurance coverage we provide  and because we generally fix premium rates for the life of a policy when issued  we cannot adjust renewal premiums or otherwise adjust premiums over the life of a policy 
if the risk underlying a particular mortgage insurance or financial guaranty coverage develops more adversely than we anticipate  or if national and regional economies undergo unanticipated stress  we generally cannot increase premium rates on in force business  cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage to mitigate the effects of these adverse developments 
despite the analytical methods we employ  our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur 
an increase in the amount or frequency of claims beyond the levels contemplated by our pricing assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents our success depends  in part  on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio 
our income from our investment portfolio is one of our primary sources of cash flow to support our operations and claim payments 
if we incorrectly calculate our policy liabilities  or if we improperly structure our investments to meet those liabilities  we could have unexpected losses  including losses resulting from forced liquidation of investments before their maturity 
our investments and investment policies and those of our subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws 
we may be forced to change our investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory  economic and market conditions and the existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements  including the tax position  of our business segments 
we cannot be certain that our investment objectives will be achieved 
although our portfolio consists mostly of highly rated investments that comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the success of our investment activity is affected by general economic conditions  which may adversely affect the markets for interest rate sensitive securities  including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets  the level and volatility of interest rates and  consequently  the value of our fixed income securities 
volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which we directly or indirectly hold positions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
as a holding company  we depend on our subsidiaries ability to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations 
we act principally as a holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own 
dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our expense and tax sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  along with income from our investment portfolio and dividends from our affiliates c bass and sherman  are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations 
these obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal payments on debt 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us  and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  is subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations  we may be required to seek capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity or by selling assets  which we may be unable to do on favorable terms  if at all 
the need to raise additional capital or the failure to make timely payments on our obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our credit derivatives that require us to adjust their fair market value as reflected on our income statement 
our business includes the provision of credit enhancement in the form of derivative contracts 
the gains and losses on these derivative contracts are derived from internally generated models  which may differ from other models 
we estimate fair value amounts using market information  to the extent available  and valuation methodologies that we deem appropriate 
the gains and losses on assumed derivative contracts are provided by the primary insurance companies 
considerable judgment is required to interpret available market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  our estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts we could realize in a current market exchange  due to  among other factors  the lack of a liquid market 
temporary market changes as well as actual credit improvement or deterioration in these contracts are reflected in the mark to market gains and losses 
because these adjustments are reflected on our income statement  they affect our reported earnings and create earnings volatility even though they might not have a cash flow effect 
the performance of our strategic investments could harm our financial results 
part of our business involves strategic investments in other companies  and we generally do not have control over the way that these companies run their day to day operations 
in particular  our financial services segment 
table of contents consists mostly of our strategic interests in c bass and sherman 
at december   we had investments in affiliates of million 
our ability to engage in additional strategic investments is subject to the availability of capital and maintenance of our insurance financial strength ratings 
the performance of our strategic investments could be harmed by the performance of our strategic partners  changes in the financial markets generally and in the industries in which our strategic partners operate  including increased competition from new entrants in these industries  significant litigation involving the companies in which we hold a strategic interest or other significant costs incurred by such companies in complying with regulatory or other applicable laws  or changes in interest rates or other macroeconomic factors that might diminish the profitability of these businesses 
c bass s results could vary significantly from period to period 
as part of its business  c bass securitizes non conforming mortgages into mortgage backed securities 
as a result  a portion of c bass s income depends on its ability to sell different tranches of its securities in the capital markets  which can be volatile  depending on interest rates  credit spreads and liquidity 
in addition  c bass also owns mortgage backed securities  some of which can be called for redemption  particularly in low interest rate environments 
redemptions can result in volatility in c bass s quarterly results as can the application of accounting rules that require c bass to mark many components of its balance sheet to market 
although there has been growth in the volume of non conforming mortgage originations in recent years  growth in this industry may not continue if interest rates continue to rise or competition in the industry continues to increase 
if c bass is unable to continue to successfully grow its portfolio of non conforming mortgages  its income could be negatively affected 
sherman s results could be adversely impacted by increased pricing competition for the pools of consumer assets they purchase  as well as a reduction in the success of their collection efforts due to macroeconomic or other factors 
in addition  results of their credit card origination business are sensitive to interest rate changes  charge off losses and the success of their collection efforts 
as a result of their significant amount of collection efforts  there is a risk that either c bass or sherman could be subject to consumer related lawsuits and other investigations related to fair debt collection practices  which could have an adverse effect on c bass s or sherman s income  reputation and future ability to conduct business 
our international operations subject us to numerous risks 
we have committed and may in the future commit additional significant resources to expand our international operations  particularly in the uk we also are in the process of applying to commence international mortgage operations in hong kong 
accordingly  we are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities  including risks of war and civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt markets  dependence on regulatory and third party approvals  changes in rating or outlooks assigned to our foreign subsidiaries by rating agencies  challenges in attracting and retaining key foreign based employees  customers and business partners in international markets  foreign governments monetary policies and regulatory requirements  economic downturns in targeted foreign mortgage origination markets  interest rate volatility in a variety of countries  
table of contents the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign regulations and laws  some of which may be materially different than the regulatory and statutory requirements we face in our domestic business  and which may change unexpectedly  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and the need to develop and market products appropriate to the various foreign markets 
any one or more of the risks listed above could limit or prohibit us from developing our international operations profitably 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively manage new operations or successfully integrate them into our existing operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
our business may suffer if we are unable to meet our customers technological demands 
participants in the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty industries rely on e commerce and other technologies to provide and expand their products and services 
our customers generally require that we provide aspects of our products and services electronically  and the percentage of our new insurance written and claims processing that we deliver electronically has continued to increase 
we expect this trend to continue and  accordingly  we may be unable to satisfy our customers requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or otherwise are unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities 
this may result in a decrease in the business we receive  which could impact our profitability 
our information technology systems may not be configured to process information regarding new and emerging products 
many of our information technology systems have been in place for a number of years  and many of them originally were designed to process information regarding traditional products 
as products such as reduced documentation or interest only mortgages with new features emerge  or when we insure structured transactions with unique features  our systems may require modification in order to recognize these features to allow us to price or bill for our insurance of these products appropriately 
our systems also may not be capable of recording  or may incorrectly record  information about these products that may be important to our risk management and other functions 
in addition  our customers may encounter similar technological issues that prevent them from sending us complete information about the products or transactions that we insure 
making appropriate modifications to our systems involves inherent time lags and may require us to incur significant expenses 
the inability to make necessary modifications to our systems in a timely and cost effective manner may have adverse effects on our business  financial condition and operating results 
risks particular to our mortgage insurance business a decrease in the volume of high ltv home mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of cancellations or non renewals of our existing policies could have a significant effect on our revenues 
we generally provide private mortgage insurance on high ltv home mortgages 
factors that could lead to a decrease in the volume of high ltv home mortgage originations  and consequently  reduce the demand for our mortgage insurance products  include a decline in economic conditions generally or in conditions in regional and local economies  the level of home mortgage interest rates  adverse population trends  lower homeownership rates and the rate of household formation  and changes in government housing policies encouraging loans to first time homebuyers 

table of contents most of our mortgage insurance premiums earned each month are derived from the monthly renewal of policies that we previously have written 
as a result  a decrease in the length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force reduces our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
fannie mae and freddie mac generally permit homeowners to cancel their mortgage insurance when the principal amount of a mortgage falls below of the home s value 
factors that are likely to increase the number of cancellations or non renewals of our mortgage insurance policies include falling mortgage interest rates which tends to lead to increased refinancings and associated cancellations of mortgage insurance  appreciating home values  and changes in the mortgage insurance cancellation requirements applicable to mortgage lenders and homeowners 
because our mortgage insurance business is concentrated among relatively few major customers  our revenues could decline if we lose any significant customer 
our mortgage insurance business depends to a significant degree on a small number of customers 
our top ten mortgage insurance customers are generally responsible for approximately half of both our primary new insurance written in a given year and our direct primary risk in force 
this concentration of business may increase as a result of mergers of those customers or other factors 
our master policies and related lender agreements do not  and by law cannot  require our mortgage insurance customers to do business with us 
the loss of business from even one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
a large portion of our mortgage insurance risk in force consists of loans with high ltv ratios and loans that are non prime  or both  which generally result in more and larger claims than loans with lower ltv ratios and prime loans 
we generally provide private mortgage insurance on mortgage products that have more risk than conforming mortgage products 
a large portion of our mortgage insurance in force consists of insurance on mortgage loans with ltvs at origination of more than 
mortgage loans with ltvs greater than are expected to default substantially more often than those with lower ltvs 
in addition  when we are required to pay a claim on a higher ltv loan  it is generally more difficult to recover our costs from the underlying property  especially in areas with declining property values 
due to competition for prime loan business from lenders offering alternative arrangements  such as simultaneous second mortgages  a large percentage of our mortgage insurance in force is written on non prime loans  which we believe to be the largest area for growth in the private mortgage insurance industry 
in  non prime business accounted for billion or of our new primary mortgage insurance written of which was alt a  compared to billion or in of which was alt a 
at december   non prime insurance in force was billion or of total primary insurance in force  compared to billion or of primary insurance in force at december  although we historically have limited the insurance of these non prime loans to those made by lenders with good results and servicing experience in this area  because of the lack of data regarding the performance of non prime loans  and our relative inexperience in insuring these loans  we may fail to estimate default rates properly and may incur larger losses than we anticipate  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in general  non prime loans are more likely to go into default and require us to pay claims 
in addition  some of our non prime business  in particular alt a loans  tends to have larger loan balances relative to our other loans 
we cannot be certain that the increased premiums that we charge for mortgage insurance on non prime loans will be adequate to compensate us for the losses we incur on these products 
we use smart home reinsurance arrangements as a way of managing our exposure to non prime risk 
under these arrangements  we cede a portion of the risk associated with a portfolio of non prime residential mortgage 
table of contents loans insured by us to an unaffiliated reinsurance company 
the reinsurance company in turn issues credit linked notes to investors in the capital markets 
as a consequence of these arrangements  we are able to effectively transfer a portion of the non prime risk that we would otherwise hold to investors that are willing to hold the risk in exchange for payments of interest and premium on the credit linked notes 
by ceding risk in this manner  we are able to continue to take on more non prime risk and the higher premiums associated with insuring these types of products 
as a result  we consider smart home arrangements to be very important to our ability to effectively manage our risk profile and to remain competitive in the non prime market 
because the smart home arrangement ultimately depends on the willingness of investors to invest in smart home securities  we cannot be certain that smart home will always be available to us or will be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we are unable to continue to use smart home arrangements  our ability to participate in the non prime mortgage market could be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
some of our mortgage insurance products are riskier than traditional mortgage insurance 
we offer pool mortgage insurance  which exposes us to different risks than the risks applicable to primary mortgage insurance 
our pool mortgage insurance products generally cover all losses in a pool of loans up to our aggregate exposure limit  which generally is between and of the initial aggregate loan balance of the entire pool of loans 
under pool insurance  we could be required to pay the full amount of every loan in the pool within our exposure limits that is in default and upon which a claim is made until the aggregate limit is reached  rather than a percentage of the loan amount  as is the case with traditional primary mortgage insurance 
at december   billion of our mortgage insurance risk in force was attributable to pool insurance 
approximately of our mortgage insurance risk in force consists of adjustable rate mortgages or arms 
our claim frequency on arms has been higher then on fixed rate loans due to monthly payment increases that occur when interest rates rise 
we believe that claims on arms will continue to be substantially higher than for fixed rate loans during prolonged periods of rising interest rates 
in addition  we insure interest only mortgages  where the borrower pays only the interest charge on a mortgage for a specified period of time  usually five to ten years  after which the loan payment increases to include principal payments 
these loans may have a heightened propensity to default because of possible payment shocks after the initial low payment period expires and because the borrower does not automatically build equity as payments are made 
we also write credit insurance on non traditional  mortgage related assets such as second mortgages  home equity loans and mortgages with ltvs above  provide credit enhancement to mortgage related capital market transactions such as net interest margin securities and credit default swaps  and have in the past and may again write credit insurance on manufactured housing loans 
these types of insurance generally have higher claim payouts than traditional mortgage insurance products 
we have less experience writing these types of insurance and less performance data on this business  which could lead to greater losses than we anticipate 
greater than anticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
an increasing concentration of servicers in the mortgage lending industry could lead to disruptions in the servicing of mortgage loans that we insure  resulting in increased delinquencies 
we depend on reliable  consistent third party servicing of the loans that we insure 
a recent trend in the mortgage lending and mortgage loan servicing industry has been towards consolidation of loan servicers 
this reduction in the number of servicers could lead to disruptions in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies 
this  in turn  could contribute to a rise in delinquencies among those loans and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we face the possibility of higher claims as our mortgage insurance policies age 
historically  most claims under private mortgage insurance policies on prime loans occur during the third through fifth year after issuance of the policies  and under policies on non prime loans during the second through 
table of contents fourth year after issuance of the policies 
low mortgage interest rate environments tend to lead to increased refinancing of mortgage loans and to lower the average age of our mortgage insurance policies 
on the other hand  increased interest rates tend to reduce mortgage refinancings and cause a greater percentage of our mortgage insurance risk in force to reach its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
in addition  periods of growth in our business tend to reduce the average age of our policies 
for example  the relatively recent growth of our non prime mortgage insurance business means that a significant percentage of our insurance in force on non prime loans has not yet reached its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
if the growth of our new business were to slow or decline  a greater percentage of our total mortgage insurance in force could reach its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
a resulting increase in claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims 
in our mortgage insurance business  we enter into agreements with our mortgage lender customers that commit us to insure loans using pre established underwriting guidelines 
once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program  we generally insure a loan originated by that lender even if the lender has not followed our specified underwriting guidelines 
under this program  a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender s delegated underwriting authority 
even if we terminate a lender s underwriting authority  we remain at risk for any loans previously insured on our behalf by the lender before that termination 
the performance of loans insured through programs of delegated underwriting has not been tested over a period of extended adverse economic conditions  meaning that the program could lead to greater losses than we anticipate 
greater than anticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we face risks associated with our contract underwriting business 
as part of our mortgage insurance business  we provide contract underwriting services to some of our mortgage lender customers  even with respect to loans for which we are not providing mortgage insurance 
under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements  we agree that if we make mistakes in connection with these underwriting services  the mortgage lender may  subject to certain conditions  require us to purchase the loans or issue mortgage insurance on the loans  or to indemnify it against future loss associated with the loans 
accordingly  we assume some credit risk and interest rate risk in connection with providing these services 
in a rising interest rate environment  the value of loans that we are required to repurchase could decrease  and consequently  our costs of those repurchases could increase 
in  we underwrote billion in principal amount of loans through contract underwriting 
depending on market conditions  a significant amount of our underwriting services may be performed by independent contractors hired by us on a temporary basis 
if these independent contractors make more mistakes than we anticipate  the resulting need to provide greater than anticipated recourse to mortgage lenders could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
if housing values fail to appreciate or begin to decline  we may be less able to recover amounts paid on defaulted mortgages 
the amount of loss we suffer  if any  depends in part on whether the home of a borrower who has defaulted on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest on the mortgage and expenses from the sale 
if a borrower defaults under our standard mortgage insurance policy  generally we have the option of paying the entire loss amount and taking title to a mortgaged property or paying our coverage percentage in full satisfaction of our obligations under the policy 
in the strong housing market of recent years  we have been able to take title to the properties underlying certain defaulted loans and to sell the properties quickly at prices that have allowed us to recover most or all of our losses 
if housing values fail to appreciate or begin to decline  the frequency of loans going to claim and our ability to mitigate our losses on defaulted mortgages may be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition from other mortgage insurance providers and from alternative products 
the united states mortgage insurance industry is highly dynamic and intensely competitive 
our competitors include other private mortgage insurers  some of which are subsidiaries of well capitalized companies with stronger insurance financial strength ratings and greater access to capital than we have  federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the va and the fha  which has increased its competitive position in areas with higher home prices by streamlining its down payment formula and reducing the premiums it charges  and mortgage lenders that demand increased participation in revenue sharing arrangements such as captive reinsurance arrangements 
governmental and quasi governmental entities typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have  and therefore  may have financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
in the event that a government owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets determines to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit motive  we may be unable to compete in that market effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  there are an increasing number of alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance  and new alternatives may develop  which could reduce the demand for our mortgage insurance 
existing alternatives include mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  mostly through loans or other forms of simultaneous second loans 
the use of simultaneous second loans has increased significantly during recent years and is likely to continue to be a competitive alternative to private mortgage insurance  particularly in light of the following factors the potential lower monthly cost of simultaneous second loans compared to the cost of mortgage insurance in a low interest rate environment  the tax deductibility in most cases of interest on second mortgages compared to the non deductibility of mortgage insurance payments  and possible negative borrower  broker and realtor perceptions about mortgage insurance 
investors using other forms of credit enhancement such as credit default swaps or securitizations as a partial or complete substitute for private mortgage insurance  and mortgage lenders and other intermediaries that forego third party insurance coverage and retain the full risk of loss on their high ltv loans 
much of the competition described above is directed at prime loans  which has led us to shift more of our business to insuring riskier  non prime loans 
in addition  the intense competition we face in the mortgage insurance industry requires that we dedicate time and energy to the development and introduction of competitive new products and programs 
our inability to compete with other providers and the various alternatives to traditional mortgage insurance  including the timely introduction of profitable new products and programs  or our incurring increased losses as a result of insuring more non prime loans could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
because many of the mortgage loans that we insure are sold to fannie mae and freddie mac  changes in their charters or business practices could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business 
fannie mae s and freddie mac s charters generally prohibit them from purchasing any mortgage with a loan amount that exceeds of the home s value  unless that mortgage is insured by a qualified insurer or the 
table of contents mortgage seller retains at least a participation in the loan or agrees to repurchase the loan in the event of a default 
as a result  high ltv mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac generally are insured with private mortgage insurance 
fannie mae and freddie mac are the beneficiaries of the majority of our mortgage insurance policies 
changes in the charters or business practices of fannie mae or freddie mac could reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently reduce our revenues 
some of fannie mae s and freddie mac s more recent programs require less insurance coverage than they historically have required  and they have the ability to further reduce coverage requirements  which could reduce demand for mortgage insurance and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
fannie mae and freddie mac also have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers and to alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low down payment mortgages they purchase 
we cannot predict the extent to which any new requirements may be implemented or how they may affect the operations of our mortgage insurance business  our capital requirements and our products 
additionally  fannie mae and freddie mac could decide to treat more favorably mortgage insurance companies rated aaa rather than aa 
although this has not occurred to date  such a decision could impair our aa rated subsidiaries ability to compete with aaa rated companies of which there currently is one and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
fannie mae s and freddie mac s business practices may be impacted by legislative or regulatory changes governing their operations and the operations of other government sponsored enterprises 
fannie mae and freddie mac currently are subject to ongoing investigations regarding their accounting practices  disclosures and other matters  and legislation proposing increased regulatory oversight over them is currently under consideration in the us congress 
the proposed legislation encompasses substantially all of the operations of fannie mae and freddie mac and is intended to be a comprehensive overhaul of the existing regulatory structure 
although we cannot predict whether  or in what form  this legislation will be enacted  the proposed legislation could limit the growth of fannie mae and freddie mac  which could reduce the size of the mortgage insurance market and consequently have an adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and results of operations 
legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our mortgage insurance business 
our business and legal liabilities may be affected by the application of existing federal or state consumer lending and insurance laws and regulations  or by unfavorable changes in these laws and regulations 
for example  recent regulatory changes have reduced demand for private mortgage insurance by increasing the maximum loan amount that the fha can insure and reducing the premiums it charges 
also  we have been subject to consumer lawsuits alleging violations of the provisions of the respa that prohibit the giving of any fee  kickback or thing of value under any agreement or understanding that real estate settlement services will be referred 
in addition  proposed changes to the application of respa could harm our competitive position 
hud proposed an exemption under respa for lenders that  at the time a borrower submits a loan application  give the borrower a firm  guaranteed price for all the settlement services associated with the loan  commonly referred to as bundling 
in  hud withdrew the proposed rule and submitted another rule to the office of management and budget  the contents of which have not yet been made public 
if bundling is exempted from respa  mortgage lenders may have increased leverage over us  and the premiums we are able to charge for mortgage insurance could be negatively affected 

table of contents risks particular to our financial guaranty business our financial guaranty business may subject us to significant risks from the failure of a single company  municipality or other entity whose obligations we have insured 
the breadth of our financial guaranty business exposes us to potential losses in a variety of our products as a result of credit problems with one counterparty 
for example  we could be exposed to an individual corporate credit risk in multiple transactions if the credit is contained in multiple portfolios of collateralized debt obligations that we have insured  or if one counterparty or its affiliates acts as the originator or servicer of the underlying assets or loans backing any of the structured securities that we have insured 
although we track our aggregate exposure to single counterparties in our various lines of business and have established underwriting criteria to manage aggregate risk from a single counterparty  we cannot be certain that our ultimate exposure to a single counterparty will not exceed our underwriting guidelines  due to merger or otherwise  or that an event with respect to a single counterparty will not cause a significant loss in one or more of the transactions in which we face risk to such counterparty 
in addition  because we insure and reinsure municipal obligations  we can have significant exposures to individual municipal entities  directly or indirectly through explicit or implicit support of related entities 
even though we believe that the risk of a complete loss on some municipal obligations generally is lower than for corporate credits because some municipal bonds are backed by taxes or other pledged revenues  a single default by a municipality could have a significant impact on our liquidity or could result in a large or even complete loss that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our financial guaranty business is concentrated among relatively few major customers  meaning that our revenues could decline if we lose any significant customer 
our financial guaranty business derives a significant percentage of its annual gross premiums from a small number of customers 
a loss of business from even one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in may  moody s downgraded the financial strength rating of radian reinsurance inc  our principal financial guaranty reinsurance subsidiary 
as a result  one of the few primary insurer customers of our financial guaranty reinsurance business exercised its right  effective february   to recapture significant reinsurance ceded to us 
after giving effect to this recapture  one single customer of our financial guaranty business accounted for over of the premiums written by our financial guaranty business in the may downgrade followed an earlier downgrade by s p of the same reinsurance subsidiary in october that resulted in the recapture by another of our customers of substantially all of the financial guaranty reinsurance business it had ceded to us 
for more information regarding these downgrades  see ratings in item further downgrades could trigger similar recapture rights in our other primary insurer customers  or we may lose a customer for other reasons  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
some of our financial guaranty products are riskier than traditional guaranties of public finance obligations 
in addition to the traditional guaranties of public finance bonds  we write guaranties involving structured finance transactions that expose us to a variety of complex credit risks and indirectly to market  political and other risks beyond those that generally apply to financial guaranties of public finance obligations 
we issue financial guaranties connected with certain asset backed transactions and securitizations secured by one or a few classes of assets  such as residential mortgages  auto loans and leases  credit card receivables and other consumer assets  obligations under credit default swaps  both funded and synthetic  and in the past have issued financial guaranties covering utility mortgage bonds and multi family housing bonds 
we also have exposure to trade credit reinsurance which is currently in run off  which protects sellers of goods under certain circumstances against nonpayment of their accounts receivable 
these guaranties expose us to the risk of buyer nonpayment  which could be triggered by many factors  including the failure of a buyer s business 
these guaranties may 
table of contents cover receivables where the buyer and seller are in the same country as well as cross border receivables 
in the case of cross border transactions  we sometimes grant coverage that effectively provides coverage to losses that could result from political risks  such as foreign currency controls and expropriation  which could interfere with the payment from the buyer 
losses associated with these non public finance financial guaranty products are difficult to predict accurately  and a failure to properly anticipate those losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may be forced to reinsure greater risks than we desire due to adverse selection by ceding companies 
a portion of our financial guaranty reinsurance business is written under treaties that generally give the ceding company some ability to select the risks that they cede to us within the terms of the treaty 
there is a risk under these treaties that the ceding companies will decide to cede to us exposures that have higher rating agency capital charges or that the ceding companies expect to be less profitable  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we attempt to mitigate this risk in a number of ways  including requiring ceding companies to retain a specified minimum percentage on a pro rata basis of the ceded business  but we cannot be certain that our mitigation attempts will succeed 
our financial guaranty business faces intense competition 
the financial guaranty industry is highly competitive 
the principal sources of direct and indirect competition are other financial guaranty insurance companies  multiline insurers that have increased their participation in financial guaranty reinsurance  some of which have formed strategic alliances with some of the us primary financial guaranty insurers  other forms of credit enhancement  including letters of credit  guaranties and credit default swaps provided in most cases by foreign and domestic banks and other financial institutions  some of which are governmental enterprises  that have been assigned the highest ratings awarded by one or more of the major rating agencies or have agreed to post collateral to support their risk position  alternate transaction structures that permit issuers to securitize assets more cost effectively without the need for credit enhancement of the types we provide  and cash rich investors seeking additional yield on their investments by foregoing credit enhancement 
competition in the financial guaranty reinsurance business is based on many factors  including overall financial strength  financial strength ratings  pricing and service 
the rating agencies allow credit to a ceding company s capital requirements and single risk limits for reinsurance that is ceded 
the amount of this credit is in part determined by the financial strength rating of the reinsurer 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have and are better capitalized than we are and or have been assigned higher ratings by one or more of the major rating agencies 
in addition  the rating agencies could change the level of credit they will allow a ceding company to take for amounts ceded to us and or similarly rated reinsurers 
in  the laws applicable to new york domiciled monoline financial guarantors were amended to permit them to use certain default swaps meeting applicable requirements as statutory collateral ie  to offset their statutory single risk limits  aggregate risk limits  aggregate net liability calculations and contingency reserve requirements 
this regulatory change  which makes credit default swaps a more attractive alternative to traditional financial guaranty reinsurance  may result in a reduced demand for traditional monoline financial guaranty reinsurance in the future 
an inability to compete for desirable financial guaranty business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
legislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could harm our financial guaranty business 
the laws and regulations affecting the municipal  asset backed and trade credit debt markets  as well as other governmental regulations  could be changed in ways that subject us to additional legal liability or affect the 
table of contents demand for the primary financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance that we provide 
any such change could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
changes in tax laws could reduce the demand for or profitability of financial guaranty insurance  which could harm our business 
any material change in the us tax treatment of municipal securities  or the imposition of a flat tax or a national sales tax in lieu of the current federal income tax structure in the united states  could adversely affect the market for municipal obligations and  consequently  reduce the demand for related financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance 
for example  the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  enacted in may  significantly reduced the federal income tax rate for individuals on dividends and long term capital gains 
this tax change may reduce demand for municipal obligations and  in turn  may reduce the demand for financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance of these obligations by increasing the comparative yield on dividend paying equity securities 
future potential changes in us tax laws  including current efforts to eliminate the federal income tax on dividends  might also affect demand for municipal obligations and for financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance of those obligations 
we may be unable to develop or sustain our financial guaranty business if it cannot obtain reinsurance or other forms of capital 
in order to comply with regulatory  rating agency and internal capital and single risk retention limits as our financial guaranty business grows  we need access to sufficient reinsurance or other capital capacity to underwrite transactions 
the market for reinsurance recently has become more concentrated because several participants have exited the industry 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance or other forms of capital  we may be unable to issue new policies and grow our financial guaranty business

item legal proceedings 
in january  a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against radian guaranty by whitney whitfield and celeste whitfield seeking class action status on behalf of a nationwide class of consumers who allegedly were required to pay for private mortgage insurance provided by radian guaranty and whose loans allegedly were insured at more than radian guaranty s best available rate  based upon credit information obtained by radian guaranty 
the action alleged that the fair credit reporting act fcra requires a notice to borrowers of such adverse action and that radian guaranty violated fcra by failing to give such notice 
the action sought statutory damages  actual damages  or both  for the people in the class  and attorneys fees  as well as declaratory and injunctive relief 
the action also alleged that the failure to give notice to borrowers in the circumstances alleged is a violation of state law applicable to sales practices and sought declaratory and injunctive relief for this alleged violation 
on october   the united states district court granted radian guaranty s motion for summary judgment 
the court held that mortgage insurance transactions between mortgage lenders and mortgage insurers are not consumer credit actions and are not subject to the notice requirements of fcra 
on november   the plaintiffs in this case appealed the district court s judgment 
similar cases  a number of which are still pending  have been brought against several other mortgage insurers 
we intend to vigorously defend the appeal of this action and any future actions concerning fcra that may be brought against us 
we cannot be certain that we will have continued success defending this case on appeal or defending against similar lawsuits that may be brought against us 
in addition to the above litigation  we are involved in litigation that has arisen in the normal course of our business 
we are contesting the allegations in each such pending action and believe  based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel  that the outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item and the risk factors detailed in item a of part i of this report 
overview we provide credit protection products and financial services to mortgage lenders and other global financial institutions 
as a holder of credit risk  our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the credit performance of the underlying insured assets 
we experienced good results for  although the business production environment for mortgage insurance and financial guaranty insurance continued to present challenges 
the results of our mortgage insurance business were generally good in  but revenues decreased slightly from the prior year due mainly to a continued high level of refinancings 
an increase in new structured transactions and non traditional products has partially offset the effects of the continuing unprecedented refinance wave 
this refinance wave has caused continued high cancellation rates which  along with production challenges due to the increased popularity of alternatives to mortgage insurance products  has negatively impacted insurance in force 
positively  credit performance was strong as mortgage insurance claims were very low in  but this was offset by an increase in delinquencies  which is a leading indicator of future claims 
the mortgage insurance mix of business has continued to include a higher percentage of lower credit profile business such as alternative a alt a and a minus mortgages and new unproven products such as interest only loans 
this is considered a growth area of the market as some of the prime mortgage market continues to be absorbed by arrangements and other hybrid products that do not typically include mortgage insurance 
we expect to continue to increase our insurance of new and emerging products that we have less experience with both domestically and internationally  which adds to the uncertainty of future credit performance 
however  premiums received for these products are higher than more traditional products and often have structuring features such as deductibles that benefit our risk position 
as has been the case for the last several years  much of our business has not yet reached its peak claim period 
in the financial guaranty business  new business production generally continued to be challenged by tight credit spreads  which impacted premium rates more than it did our ability to close transactions 
direct public finance production remained strong and 
table of contents credit performance was generally good 
we have also been writing more of our structured business in a super senior  more remote risk area 
for  the financial services segment showed another period of strong earnings and return on investment  which was  in part  a result of the low interest rate and favorable credit environment and a strong demand from investors in asset backed securities 
we believe that our diversified credit enhancement and prudent capital management strategies are sound  and we intend to continue to implement these strategies 
we see a continued convergence between the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty markets  with an emphasis on structured credit enhancement products  including credit default swaps  becoming more common in the mortgage credit enhancement market 
in the mortgage insurance business  we are hopeful that stability in the housing and job markets can continue to positively impact credit performance and that modestly rising interest rates will help reduce cancellation rates  although these macroeconomic factors remain outside of our control 
we will continue to be challenged to solidify our unique aa financial guaranty business platform by continuing to demonstrate the ability to diversify our products  and to grow and write quality business  which will in turn solidify our franchise 
this may be difficult in a competitive  tight credit spread environment 
we have begun to slowly see some success in our efforts to increase our presence in the global markets for both mortgage and financial guaranty business 
this will allow us to take advantage of our core competencies of credit risk analysis and capital allocation to write profitable business in europe and asia  although we don t expect this to be a significant source of earnings for several years 
during  hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma struck and caused extensive property damage to the us gulf coast in alabama  louisiana  mississippi  florida and texas 
our total exposure in affected counties and parishes designated by fema for individual assistance as of january fema designated areas is as follows mortgage insurance 
our mortgage insurance primary and pool exposure to first and second lien mortgages is approximately billion of risk in force on approximately billion of insurance in force 
this exposure represents approximately of our total mortgage insurance risk in force as of december  approximately of this exposure is on non prime loans 
under our master policy of insurance  we are permitted to adjust a claim where the property underlying a mortgage in default is subject to unrestored physical damage 
public finance 
our total public finance exposure to fema designated areas is approximately million in direct net par exposure and million in assumed net par exposure including million in assumed net par exposure to the city of new orleans through reinsurance from several aaa aaa rated monoline financial guarantors 
this total net par exposure represents about of our total net par public finance exposure as of december  in the event of a claim  we typically are obligated under our public finance insurance policies to continue making regularly scheduled payments of debt service as and when due  and therefore  we are not initially responsible for  and may never become liable for  the entire amount of such obligation 
we believe that certain obligations in the affected areas will require principal and interest advances although the ultimate losses  if any  from such obligations are uncertain 
structured finance 
our total structured finance exposure to fema designated areas is approximately million  including million in direct net par exposure and million in assumed net par exposure to insured asset backed and mortgage backed obligations 
in addition  we also are exposed to direct pooled corporate obligations and or obligations of asset backed securities  however  we believe there is significant diversification of assets  both as to type and geographical dispersion of the collateral in these pools  and as a result  we view our exposure in these structures to the affected areas as immaterial 
we also reinsure pooled corporate obligations that include corporate credits affected by the hurricanes 
defaults of these credits would not likely result in a material claim against us given the degree of credit protection beneath our exposure 

table of contents since august   we have paid approximately million in claims on insurance written in fema designated areas 
while we have experienced an increase in defaults in mortgage insurance in fema designated areas approximately  defaults  related to katrina as of december  it is too early to tell how many claims we ultimately may have to pay on these defaults 
there are many factors that are contributing to the uncertainty surrounding these defaults 
the organizations servicing these loans are reporting defaults  in some cases  despite the existence of forbearance agreements that permit homeowners to defer mortgage payments on these loans 
in addition  we anticipate  but cannot be certain  that aid both from private organizations and from federal  state and local governments and payments from property and casualty insurers will help to reduce the number of potential claims in these areas by providing a direct source of cash to homeowners and also serving as an economic stimulus in these areas 
limitations also exist in our master policy of insurance that could prevent us from paying all or part of a claim 
for example  we are permitted to adjust a claim where the property underlying a mortgage in default is subject to unrestored physical damage 
the level of damage being reported in the areas where the defaulting loans are located varies significantly from region to region 
until we have a better understanding of how many of the hurricane related defaults are likely to result in claims  we intend to reserve for these mortgage insurance defaults as we would for any other non hurricane related delinquencies 
we therefore  have not taken a view that these loans will perform better or worse than any other delinquencies 
as of december   we had established a related mortgage insurance loss reserve of million related to the  hurricane related defaults  including a reserve of million for the  defaults associated with hurricane katrina 
as part of our own comprehensive relief program initiated in response to these hurricanes  we are supporting more flexible mortgage payment terms in order to accommodate the financial needs of homeowners in affected areas 
business summary our principal business segments are mortgage insurance  financial guaranty and financial services 
the following table shows the percentage contributions to net income and equity allocated to each segment for the year ended december  net income equity mortgage insurance financial guaranty financial services mortgage insurance our mortgage insurance business provides credit related insurance coverage  principally through private mortgage insurance  and risk management services to mortgage lending institutions located throughout the united states and select countries overseas 
we provide these products and services through our wholly owned subsidiaries  radian guaranty inc  amerin guaranty corporation and radian insurance inc which we refer to as radian guaranty  amerin guaranty and radian insurance 
private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default related losses on residential first mortgage loans made mostly to home buyers who make down payments of less than of the home s purchase price 
private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market  some of which are sold to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
freddie mac and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
we sometimes refer to freddie mac and fannie mae collectively as government sponsored enterprises or gses 
our mortgage insurance business  through radian guaranty  offers primary and pool private mortgage insurance coverage on residential first lien mortgages 
at december   primary insurance on first lien 
table of contents mortgages made up of our total first lien mortgage insurance risk in force  and pool insurance on first lien mortgages made up of our total first lien mortgage insurance risk in force 
we use radian insurance to provide credit enhancement for mortgage related capital market transactions and to write credit insurance on mortgage related assets that monoline mortgage guaranty insurers are not permitted to insure  including net interest margin securities nims  international insurance transactions  second lien mortgages  home equity loans and credit default swaps collectively  we refer to the risk associated with these transactions as other risk in force 
we also insure second lien mortgages through amerin guaranty 
at december   other risk in force was of our total mortgage insurance risk in force 
we carefully review and assess international markets for opportunities to expand our mortgage insurance operations 
during  we increased the level of mortgage insurance business that we have been writing internationally 
on several occasions  we have provided credit protection on pools of mortgages in the united kingdom uk and in the netherlands  and we have applied for authorization to conduct mortgage insurance operations in the uk in and early in  we entered into two mortgage reinsurance transactions in australia  and in the fourth quarter of  we wrote billion in notional value of credit protection in credit default swap form on two large aaa tranches of mortgage backed securities  one in germany and one in denmark 
we ve also recently entered into a relationship with one of the largest mortgage lenders in hong kong to serve as its exclusive provider of mortgage insurance 
we are in the process of applying for branch authorization in hong kong 
premium rates for our mortgage insurance business are determined on a risk adjusted basis that includes borrower  loan and property characteristics 
we use proprietary default and prepayment models to project the premiums we should charge  the losses and expenses we should expect to incur and the capital we need to hold in support of our risk 
pricing is established in an amount that we expect will allow a reasonable return on allocated capital 
we generally cannot cancel or elect not to renew the mortgage insurance that we provide and  because we generally establish premium rates for the life of the policy when issued  we cannot adjust renewal premiums or otherwise adjust premiums over the life of the policy to mitigate the effect of adverse developments 
our mortgage insurance business depends on a small number of lenders for a substantial portion of its business 
our top mortgage insurance customers measured by primary risk in force were responsible for of the direct primary risk in force at december  the top customers were also responsible for of primary new insurance written in the largest single mortgage insurance customer including branches and affiliates of such customer  measured by new insurance written  accounted for of new insurance written during  compared to in and in the concentration of business with our mortgage insurance customers may increase or decrease as a result of many factors 
these customers may reduce the amount of business currently done with us or cease doing business with us altogether 
our master policies and related lender agreements do not  and by law cannot  require lenders to do business with us 
the loss of business from a major lender could have a materially adverse affect on our business and financial results 
we expect customer concentration to continue as a result of the ongoing consolidation in the financial services industry in general and the mortgage industry in particular 
in  in an effort to more appropriately align our mortgage insurance business to meet the needs of a changing business environment resulting from lender consolidation  centralization  and a movement toward a more capital markets risk based approach  we reorganized our sales and marketing efforts to focus on four separate channels of customers business direct  strategic accounts  capital markets and international 
customers are grouped into the above categories and they are serviced by four separate business units 
each channel has a business manager with profit and loss responsibility and accountability 
in addition  each channel has adopted a specific and focused approach to sustaining profitable growth 
in each channel  there is a priority of maximizing return on capital  enhancing top line and bottom line growth  and an ongoing pursuit of achieving efficiencies through cost reductions and increased productivity 

table of contents we and other companies in the mortgage insurance industry participate in reinsurance arrangements with mortgage lenders commonly referred to as captive reinsurance arrangements 
under captive reinsurance arrangements  a mortgage lender typically establishes a reinsurance company that assumes part of the risk associated with that lender s mortgages that are insured by a mortgage insurer on an individual  mortgage by mortgage basis as compared to mortgages insured in structured transactions  which typically are not eligible for captive reinsurance arrangements 
in return for the reinsurance company s assumption of a portion of the risk  the mortgage insurer cedes a portion of its mortgage insurance premiums to the reinsurance company 
in most cases  the risk assumed by the reinsurance company is an excess layer of aggregate losses that would be penetrated only in a situation of adverse loss development  such as losses brought on by national or regional downturns in the real estate market 
because of many factors  including the incentives for mortgage lenders to funnel relatively higher quality loans through the captive reinsurer  we continue to evaluate the level of revenue sharing against risk sharing on a customer by customer basis as part of our customer profitability analysis 
we believe that all of our captive reinsurance arrangements transfer risk to the captive reinsurer at a premium rate that is commensurate with the risk 
for  premiums ceded under captive reinsurance arrangements were million or of total premiums earned during the period  compared to million or of total premiums earned for the same period of and million or for new primary insurance written under captive reinsurance arrangements for was billion or of total primary new insurance written  compared to billion or of total primary new insurance written for and billion or for these percentages can be volatile as a result of increases or decreases in the volume of structured transactions  which are not typically eligible for captive reinsurance arrangements 
we and other mortgage insurers have faced private lawsuits alleging  among other things  that our captive reinsurance arrangements constitute unlawful payments to mortgage lenders under the anti referral fee provisions of the real estate settlement practices act of respa 
we also have been subject to inquiries from the new york insurance department relating to our captive reinsurance arrangements 
we have delegated underwriting programs with a significant number of our customers 
our delegated underwriting programs allow lenders to commit us to insure loans that meet agreed upon underwriting guidelines 
delegated loans are submitted to us in various ways fax  electronic data interchange and through the internet 
our delegated underwriting programs currently include only lenders that are approved by our risk management area  and we routinely audit loans submitted under this program 
once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program  however  we generally insure all loans submitted to us by that lender even if the lender has not followed our specified underwriting guidelines 
although we have not experienced this to date  a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender s delegated underwriting authority 
we mitigate this risk through periodic  on site reviews of selected delegated lenders 
as of december   approximately of the insurance in force on our books was originated on a delegated basis  compared to as of december  to date  there have been no significant issues with loans originated on a delegated basis 
our mortgage insurance business also utilizes its underwriting skills to provide an outsourced underwriting service to its customers known as contract underwriting 
for a fee  we underwrite loan files for secondary market compliance  while concurrently assessing the file for mortgage insurance if applicable 
we give recourse to our customers on loans we underwrite for compliance 
if we make a material error in underwriting a loan  we agree to provide a remedy of repurchasing or placing additional mortgage insurance coverage on the loan or indemnifying the customer against loss 
for  loans written via contract underwriting accounted for of applications  of commitments  and of certificates issued by our mortgage insurance business  compared to  and  respectively  for and  and  respectively  for from time to time  we sell  on market terms  loans we have purchased under contract underwriting remedies to our affiliate  credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass 
during  we sold million of loans sold to c bass compared to million of loans to c bass during 
table of contents financial guaranty we entered the financial guaranty business through our acquisition in of enhance financial services group inc efsg  a new york based holding company that mainly provides financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance 
financial guaranty insurance generally provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a financial obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when due 
our financial guaranty business offers the following products insurance of municipal obligations  which include tax exempt and taxable indebtedness of states  counties  cities  utility districts and other political subdivisions  bonds issued by sovereign and sub sovereign entities and financings for enterprises such as airports  public and private higher education and health care facilities  where the issuers of such obligations are typically rated investment grade bbb baa or higher  insurance of structured finance transactions  consisting of funded and non funded or synthetic asset backed obligations that are payable from or tied to the performance of a specific pool of assets and that offer a defined cash flow 
examples include residential and commercial mortgages  a variety of consumer loans  corporate loans and bonds  equipment receivables  real and personal property leases and collateralized corporate debt obligations  including obligations of counterparties under derivative transactions and credit default swaps 
the insured obligations in our financial guaranty business are generally rated investment grade  without the benefit of our insurance  financial solutions products included in our structured direct business consisting of guaranties of securities exchanges  excess securities investor protection corporation sipc insurance for brokerage firms and excess federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance for banks  and reinsurance of public finance  structured finance  financial solutions and trade credit obligations in which we generally rely on the underwriting performed by the primary insurer 
in october  we announced that we would be exiting the trade credit reinsurance line of business 
accordingly  this line of business has been placed into run off and we have ceased initiating new trade credit reinsurance contracts going forward 
we expect that our existing trade credit reinsurance business  including claims paid  will take several years to run off  although we expect that the bulk of the remaining premiums will be earned and losses incurred over the next two years 
management does not consider the trade credit line of business to be core to our financial guaranty business  and we do not expect that our move to exit the trade credit reinsurance line of business will materially impact the overall profitability or business position of our financial guaranty business 
however  in the short term  our decision to exit the trade credit reinsurance line of business will likely have a negative impact on certain financial measures for our financial guaranty business as this business line continues to run off 
trade credit insurance protects sellers of goods under certain circumstances against non payment of their receivables  and covers receivables where the buyer and seller are in the same country  as well as cross border receivables 
in the latter instance  the coverage sometimes extends to certain political risks foreign currency controls  expropriation  etc 
that potentially could interfere with the payment from the buyer 
in  trade credit reinsurance accounted for of financial guaranty s net premiums written  down from of financial guaranty s net premiums written in in our financial guaranty business  the issuer of an insured obligation generally pays the premiums for our insurance either in full at the inception of the policy or  in the case of most structured finance transactions  in monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual installments from the cash flow of the related collateral 
premiums for synthetic credit protection are generally paid in monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual installments  but occasionally all or a portion of the premium is paid upfront at the inception of the protection 
however  in synthetic credit protection transactions  payment is due directly from our counterparty and is generally not restricted to the cash flows from the underlying obligation or collateral supporting the obligation 
since we depend on the corporate creditworthiness of our counterparty rather than the cash flows from the insured collateral for payment  we generally have a right to terminate synthetic credit protection without penalty to us if our counterparty fails to pay amounts owed to us when due under the terms of the synthetic credit protection 

table of contents for public finance transactions  premiums are typically paid upfront and premium rates typically are stated as a percentage of debt service  which includes total principal and interest 
for structured finance transactions  premiums are paid in installments over time and premium rates typically are stated as a percentage of the total principal 
premiums are generally non refundable 
premiums paid in full at inception are recorded as revenue earned over the life of the insured obligation or the coverage period for such obligation if shorter 
premiums paid in installments are generally recorded as revenue in the accounting period in which coverage is provided 
this long and relatively predictable premium earnings pattern from our public finance transactions provides us with a relatively predictable source of future revenues 
the establishment of a premium rate for a transaction reflects some or all of the following factors issuer related factors  such as the issuer s credit strength and sources of income  servicer related factors  such as the ability of our counterparty or third party servicer to manage the underlying collateral and the servicer s credit strength and sources of income  obligation related factors  such as the type of issue  the type and amount of collateral pledged  the revenue sources and amounts  the existence of structural features designed to provide additional credit enhancement should collateral performance not meet original expectations  the nature of any restrictive covenants and the length of time until the obligation s stated maturity  and insurer and market related factors  such as rating agency capital charges  competition  if any  from other insurers and the credit spreads in the market available to pay premiums 
the majority of insured public finance and structured finance transactions are guaranteed by triple a rated financial guaranty insurers 
as a aa aa rated company  our financial guaranty business mainly targets distinct niches in the capital markets 
there is generally a greater interest cost savings to an issuer by using triple a rated credit enhancement as compared to our aa aa rated credit enhancement 
however  financial guaranty insurance provided by a lower rated provider also can provide significant value over uninsured executions in markets where the triple a rated financial guaranty insurance is unavailable or uneconomical 
in some markets  issuers and other counterparties receive no additional rating agency credit or regulatory relief from triple a rated enhancement than they do with our aa aa enhancement  so our enhancement in these markets may be more economical 
on april   fitch affirmed the aa insurance financial strength rating of radian asset assurance inc radian asset assurance  our principal financial guaranty operating subsidiary  and radian asset assurance limited raal  a subsidiary of radian asset assurance that is authorized to conduct insurance business in the uk  but revised its ratings outlook for the two entities to negative from stable 
fitch s ratings for us and our other rated subsidiaries are unchanged 
none of the primary insurance customers of our financial guaranty business have any recapture rights as a result of this ratings action by fitch 
effective june   efsg s two main operating subsidiaries  radian asset assurance and radian reinsurance inc radian reinsurance were merged  with radian asset assurance as the surviving company 
through this merger  the financial guaranty reinsurance business formerly conducted by radian reinsurance was combined with the direct financial guaranty business conducted by radian asset assurance 
the merger also combined the assets  liabilities and stockholders equity of the two companies 
prior to the merger  moody s investor service moody s downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of radian reinsurance from aa to aa as a result of this downgrade  two of the primary insurer customers of our financial guaranty reinsurance business had the right to recapture previously written business ceded to our financial guaranty reinsurance business 
effective february   one of these customers recaptured approximately billion of par in force that it had ceded to us  including million of written premiums as of february   million of which was recorded as an immediate reduction of premiums earned at the time of the recapture  which represents the difference between statutory accounting requirements stat and accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states of america gaap unearned premiums 
this return of unearned premiums resulted in an increase in policy acquisition costs of million 
the aggregate result was a reduction in pre tax income of million  or approximately per share after tax on a gaap basis 
the amount of future lost premiums due to this recapture will be approximately million  which consists of the unearned premium balance and the value of future installment premiums 
based on the february  recapture date the total approximate reduction in pre tax income for  including the immediate impact  was approximately million or approximately per share after tax 
the sum of the above adjustments related to this recapture is summarized as follows cash paid received gaap book basis initial gain loss in thousands unearned premiums acquisition costs total despite the recapture  this primary insurer customer renewed its reinsurance treaty with us for and again recently for on substantially the same terms as in prior to the may downgrade 
in march  without cost to or concessions by us  this customer waived all of its remaining recapture rights with respect to the may downgrade by moody s 
the other customer with recapture rights as a result of the may downgrade agreed  without cost to or concessions by us  to waive its recapture rights 
there are no remaining recapture rights with respect to the may moody s downgrade of radian reinsurance 
the combined company is now rated aa with a stable outlook by moody s  aa with a negative outlook by standard and poor s insurance rating service s p and aa with a negative outlook by fitch rating service fitch 
in october  s p downgraded the insurer financial strength rating of radian reinsurance from aaa to aa 
as a result of this downgrade  effective january   one of the primary insurer customers of our financial guaranty reinsurance business exercised its right to recapture approximately billion of par in force ceded to our financial guaranty reinsurance business  including million of net premiums written with a gaap carrying value of approximately million 
the entire impact of this recapture was reflected as a reduction of net premiums written in the first quarter of because  in accordance with gaap  we already had reflected million of these recaptured net premiums written as having been earned  we were required to record the entire million reduction in net premiums earned in the first quarter of also in connection with the recapture in the first quarter of  we were reimbursed for policy acquisition costs of approximately million for which the carrying value under gaap was million 
in addition  the recapture included approximately million that had been recorded as case reserves under gaap 
finally  we took a charge of million for mark to market adjustments related to certain insurance policies associated with the recapture 
the sum of the above adjustments related to this recapture resulted in an immediate reduction of pre tax income of million 
we estimate that the recapture of reinsurance business reduced pre tax income by approximately million or approximately per share after tax  per share of which was a result of the immediate impact of the recapture  and the balance was a result of recaptured net premiums written that would have been earned over time and estimated losses 

table of contents the sum of the above adjustments related to this recapture is summarized as follows cash paid received gaap book basis initial gain loss in thousands unearned premium acquisition costs case reserves receivable from unrealized credit derivatives gain totals without cost to or concessions by us  the remaining primary insurer customers with recapture rights agreed not to exercise those rights with respect to the october downgrade by s p 
none of the primary insurer customers of our financial guaranty reinsurance business have any remaining recapture rights as a result of prior downgrades of radian asset assurance s or radian reinsurance s financial strength ratings from any of the three major ratings agencies 
through raal  we have additional opportunities to write financial guaranty insurance in the uk and  subject to compliance with the european passporting rules  in other countries in the european union 
in particular  we expect that raal will continue to build its structured products business in the uk and throughout the european union 
raal accounted for million of direct premiums written in or of financial guaranty s direct premiums written  which is a million increase from the million of direct premiums written in in september  the financial services authority the fsa authorized radian financial products limited rfpl  another subsidiary of radian asset assurance  to transact as a category a securities and futures firm permitting it to act as a principal on credit default swap risk 
following receipt of this authorization  management decided that rfpl should focus its core business on arranging credit default swap risk for raal and radian asset assurance 
accordingly  we expect to use rfpl solely for negotiating and arranging credit default swaps with counterparties located in the uk or other european countries with portions of the risk being assumed by raal and radian asset assurance 
as a result  we are in the process of lowering the category of authorization for rfpl commensurate with this more limited purpose 
until september   our financial guaranty business also included our ownership interest in primus guaranty  ltd 
primus  a bermuda holding company and parent to primus financial products  llc  a provider of credit risk protection to derivatives dealers and credit portfolio managers on individual investment grade entities 
in september  primus issued shares of its common stock in an initial public offering 
we sold a portion of our shares in primus as part of this offering 
as a result of our reduced ownership and influence over primus after the initial public offering  we reclassified our investment in primus to our equity securities portfolio 
accordingly  beginning with the fourth quarter of  we began recording changes in the fair value of the primus securities as other comprehensive income rather than recording income or loss as equity in net income of affiliates 
in and during the first quarter of  we sold all of our remaining shares of primus common stock  recording a pre tax gain of million in and a pre tax gain of million in the first quarter of financial services the financial services segment includes the credit based businesses conducted through our affiliates  c bass and sherman financial group llc sherman 
we own a interest in c bass and a interest in sherman 
c bass is a mortgage investment and servicing firm specializing in subprime  single family residential mortgage assets and residential mortgage backed securities 
by using sophisticated analytics  c bass essentially seeks to take advantage of what it believes to be the mispricing of credit risk for certain of these assets in the marketplace 
sherman is a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets and charged off high ltv mortgage receivables that it generally purchases at deep 
table of contents discounts from national financial institutions and major retail corporations and subsequently collects upon these receivables 
in march  sherman acquired creditone  a credit card bank that provides sherman with the ability to originate subprime credit card receivables 
on june   we entered into agreements to restructure our ownership interest in sherman 
before the restructuring  sherman was owned by us  by mortgage guaranty insurance corporation mgic and by an entity controlled by sherman s management team 
as part of the restructuring  we and mgic each agreed to sell a interest in sherman to a new entity controlled by sherman s management team  thereby reducing our ownership interest and mgic s ownership interest to for each of us 
in return  the new entity controlled by sherman s management team paid approximately million which resulted in a million loss to us and the same amount to mgic 
regulatory approval for this transaction was received in august  retroactive to may  effective june   sherman s employees were transferred to the new entity controlled by sherman s management team  and this entity agreed to provide management services to sherman 
sherman s management team also agreed to reduce significantly its maximum incentive payout under its annual incentive plan for periods beginning on or after may  this has resulted in sherman s net income now being greater than it would have been without a reduction in the maximum incentive payout 
following the restructuring  we expect that our and mgic s share of sherman s net income will be similar to our respective shares before the restructuring because  although our percentage interest in sherman is smaller than it was before the restructuring  sherman s net income is greater than it would have been if the restructuring had not occurred 
in connection with the restructuring  we and mgic each also paid million for each of us to have the right to purchase  on july   a interest in sherman from the new entity controlled by sherman s management team for a price intended to approximate current fair market value 
if either we or mgic exercise our purchase right but the other fails to exercise its purchase right  the exercising party also may exercise the purchase right of the non exercising party 
our and mgic s representation on sherman s board of managers would not change regardless of which party or parties exercise the purchase right 
prior to january   we owned a interest in sherman 
effective january   sherman s management exercised its rights to acquire additional ownership of sherman  reducing our ownership interest in sherman from to 
we recorded a million loss on this transaction 
the financial services segment formerly included the operations of radianexpress 
com inc radianexpress 
in december  we announced that we would cease operations of radianexpress 
our decision followed our receipt in july of a decision by the california commissioner of insurance sustaining a california cease and desist order applicable to the offering of our radian lien protection product 
during the first quarter of  radianexpress  which was the entity through which radian lien protection sales would have been processed  ceased processing new orders

table of contents results of operations mortgage insurance year ended december  compared to year ended december  although home purchase transactions have remained at strong levels  the mortgage insurance industry did not fully benefit from this in due to a loss of business to alternative mortgage executions that exclude mortgage insurance  particularly arrangements or other variations of simultaneous second lien mortgage loans 
in addition  refinance activity  which often results in the elimination of the need for mortgage insurance on the refinanced loan  remained high during  reducing the volume of loans requiring mortgage insurance in these items negatively impacted the flow business  but were somewhat offset by the continued increase in demand for structured transactions and non traditional products 
primary new insurance written by our mortgage insurance business during was billion  a billion or decrease from billion written in in addition  we increased the prices of some of our products  particularly investor loans  effective in the first quarter of  which led to a decrease in demand for our insurance on those specific products and  indirectly  on other products as well 
for  our mortgage insurance business wrote billion in flow business and billion in structured transactions  compared to billion in flow business and billion in structured transactions for also in  our mortgage insurance business wrote million of pool risk compared to million in and billion of other risk in compared to million in an increase in the level of structured transactions  which sometimes take the form of pool insurance  was the primary cause of the increase in pool risk written 
other risk written included a higher level of second lien mortgage insurance  insurance written internationally and an increase in other new products  such as credit default swaps  both domestically and internationally 
our participation in structured transactions is likely to vary significantly from period to period because we compete with other mortgage insurers  as well as capital market executions  for these transactions 
however  the overall level is expected to rise over time 
included in the approximate billion of other risk written in is million of risk written related to a single transaction that is a aaa wrap on a large portfolio that was written in the first quarter of in addition  billion of other risk written in was in the form of credit default swaps written as aaa tranches of mortgage backed securities in germany and denmark  which were written late in the fourth quarter of because of the remote nature of the risk associated with these transactions  premiums are low as a percentage of exposure 
the highest state concentration of risk in force at december   was florida at  compared to at december  california had the highest state concentration of total direct primary and pool insurance in force at december  at december   california accounted for of the mortgage insurance segment s total direct primary insurance in force  compared to at december   and of the mortgage insurance segment s total direct pool risk in force  compared to for california also accounted for of the mortgage insurance segment s direct primary new insurance written for and the percentage of risk in force in california has been falling due to the high cancellation rate as compared to new business written 
volume in continued to be impacted by lower interest rates that affected the entire mortgage insurance industry 
the continued low interest rate environment caused refinancing activity to remain high  which was similar to the comparable period of refinancing activity as a percentage of our primary new insurance written was for  compared to for the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of insurance in force that remains on our books after any month period  was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  this decrease in the persistency rate reflects a higher level of cancellations in the twelve months ended december  in the second quarter of  billion of primary insurance in force from one structured transaction was canceled  which reduced the persistency rate in by approximately three percentage points 
we expect the persistency rates to slowly rise throughout  influenced by relatively stable or slowly rising interest rates 
in addition to insuring prime mortgages  we also insure non prime mortgages  including mainly alt a and a minus loans 
alt a borrowers generally have a similar credit profile as the borrowers under the prime loans that 
table of contents we insure  with fair isaac and company fico credit scores of and higher  but alt a loans are underwritten with reduced documentation and verification of information 
we consider alt a business to be riskier than prime business because of the reduction or elimination of documentation supporting the loans 
alt a loans also tend to have higher balances than other loans that we insure 
we typically charge a higher premium rate for alt a business  particularly alt a loans to borrowers with fico credit scores below  and we have measures in place to limit our exposure to these lower fico alt a loans 
we previously had disclosed our intent to reduce our insurance in force for lower fico alt a business and we have done so  but we continually re evaluate this decision and will only increase our participation in this business if we believe we can do so at acceptable levels of risk and return 
the a minus loans that we insure typically have non traditional credit standards that are less stringent than standard credit guidelines and include loans to borrowers with fico scores ranging from to we receive a significantly higher premium for insuring a minus loans 
during  non prime business accounted for billion or of new primary insurance written by our mortgage insurance business  compared to billion or for of the billion of non prime business written for  billion or was alt a 
the relatively high amount of non prime business is a result of the relatively high level of structured business written in  which tends to be more concentrated in non prime loans 
in  we developed an approach for reinsuring our non prime risk 
the arrangement  which we refer to as smart home  effectively transfers risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
each transaction begins with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then enter into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer pursuant to which we agree to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of non prime residential mortgage loans insured by us 
the smart home reinsurer is funded in the capital markets through the issuance to investors of a series of separate classes of credit linked notes 
each class relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we typically retain the risk associated with the first loss coverage levels  and we may retain or sell  in a separate risk transfer agreement  the risk associated with the aaa rated or most remote coverage level 
holders of the smart home credit linked notes bear the risk of loss from losses paid to us under the reinsurance agreement 
the smart home reinsurer invests the proceeds of the notes in high quality short term investments approved by the rating agencies 
income earned on those investments and a portion of the reinsurance premiums that we pay are applied to pay interest on the notes as well as certain of the smart home reinsurer s expenses 
the rate of principal amortization of the credit linked notes approximates the rate of principal amortization of the underlying mortgages 
since august of  we have completed three smart home arrangements 
details of these transactions are as follows date of transaction pool of non prime mortgages par value risk ceded to reinsurer par value notes sold to investors principal amount december billion billion million february billion million million august million million million million in principal amount of credit linked notes was issued in december an additional million in principal amount was issued in february smart home allows us to continue to take on more non prime risk and the higher premiums associated with insuring these types of products 
as a result  we consider smart home arrangements to be important to our ability to effectively manage our risk profile and to remain competitive in the non prime market 
approximately of our non prime risk in force is currently reinsured through smart home arrangements 
we intend to increase this percentage substantially in because the smart home arrangement ultimately depends on the willingness of investors to invest in smart home securities  we cannot be certain that smart home will always be 
table of contents available to us or will be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
if we are unable to continue to use smart home arrangements  our ability to participate in the non prime mortgage market could be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
premiums written ceded in and include million and million  respectively  related to the smart home transactions 
there were no ceded losses in or as a result of the smart home transactions 
direct primary insurance in force was billion at december   compared to billion at december  in the second quarter of  billion of primary insurance in force from one structured transaction was canceled 
at december   non prime insurance in force was billion or of total primary mortgage insurance in force  compared to billion or at december  of the billion of non prime insurance in force at december   billion or was alt a 
we anticipate that the proportion of non prime mortgage insurance business and non traditional products could continue to grow as a result of structural changes  competitive pricing differentials and competitive products in the mortgage lending and mortgage insurance businesses 
pool risk in force was billion at december   compared to billion at december  in  we wrote a significant amount of pool risk where we are in a second loss position  and will therefore only pay claims if pool losses are greater than any applicable deductible or stop loss 
other risk in force was billion at december   compared to billion at december  the increase in other risk in force at december   was in large part due to the two large international mortgage securitizations comprising billion of risk  in which we provided credit enhancement at a aaa level in credit default swap form 
also included in other risk in force at december   was a single structured transaction that is a aaa wrap that was done in credit default swap form in the first quarter of because of the remote nature of the risk associated with these transactions  premiums are low as a percentage of exposure 
the default and claim cycle in the mortgage insurance business begins with our receipt of a default notice from the insured 
generally  our master policy of insurance requires the insured to notify us of a default within days after the loan has become days past due 
the total number of loans in default increased from  at december   to  at december  the average loss reserve per default decreased from  at the end of to  at december  the loans in default at december   included approximately  defaults related to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
as discussed above  it is too early to tell how many claims we may ultimately have to pay on these defaults 
primary and pool defaults also included approximately and  defaults  respectively  on loans with deductibles in excess of any required reserve 
the loss reserve as a percentage of risk in force was at december   compared to at december  the decline in the reserve per default and reserve as a percentage of risk in force is partially due to the higher mix of defaults in the early stage of delinquency and loans with deductibles in excess of any required reserve and the significant increase in risk in force relating to business in a remote loss position 
we also do not establish reserves on our derivative financial guaranty products 
defaults in the non prime mortgage insurance business  which has experienced a consistent increase in the number of defaults in the past few years  appear to have leveled off for alt a loans  but are still increasing for a minus and below loans 
although the default rate on this business is higher than on prime business  higher premium rates charged for non prime business are expected to compensate for the increased level of expected losses associated with this business 
however  we cannot be certain that the increased premiums charged on non prime business will compensate for the ultimate losses on this business 
the number of non prime loans in default at december   was  which represented of the total primary loans in default  compared to  non prime loans in default at december   which 
table of contents represented of the total primary loans in default 
the default rate on the alt a business was at december   compared to at december  the combined default rate on the a minus and below loans was at december   compared to at december  the default rate on the prime business was at december   compared to at december  the default rate on non prime business increased to at december  from at december   as a result of that business seasoning 
claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business 
relatively few claims on prime business are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy and on non prime business during the first year 
historically  claim activity on prime loans has reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of policy origination  and on non prime loans  this level is expected to be reached in the second through fourth years 
approximately of the primary risk in force and approximately of the pool risk in force at december   had not yet reached its highest claim frequency years 
because it is difficult to predict both the timing of originating new business and the run off rate of existing business  it also is difficult to predict  at any given time  the percentage of risk in force that will reach its highest claim frequency years on any future date 
the combined default rate for both primary and pool insurance  excluding second lien mortgage insurance coverage  was at december   compared to at december   while the default rate on the primary business was at december   compared to at december  direct claims paid for were million  compared to million for the average claim paid has fluctuated over the past few years mostly due to deeper coverage amounts  larger loan balances and mitigation efforts 
in addition  a change in real estate values may also affect the amount of the average claim paid 
the average claim paid in included a larger than normal amount of recoveries and reflects increased loss mitigation efforts 
alt a loans have a higher average claim payment due to higher loan balances 
claims paid on second lien mortgages decreased in compared to as a result of an increase in recoveries  partially offset by the increase in the volume of business written over the past few years on which we have begun paying claims 
during the third quarter of  we announced our intent to limit the amount of second lien mortgage business we would originate in the future  especially where we would be in a first loss position 
we continue to evaluate this decision and may increase our participation in second lien mortgage business if we believe we can do so at acceptable levels of risk and return 
for the majority of risk written on second lien mortgage business in  we are in a second or shared loss position  meaning that the insured must incur losses on the loan above a specified amount or deductible before any claim payments under the policy will be made 
in reviewing our claims inventory  we expect that paid claims will be relatively flat in the first quarter of and will increase modestly after that 
a disproportionately higher incidence of claims in georgia is directly related to what our risk management department believes to be questionable property value estimates performed by outside agencies in that state 
several years ago  our risk management department put into place several property valuation checks and balances to mitigate the risk of this issue recurring  and now applies these same techniques to all mortgage insurance transactions 
we expect this higher incidence of claims in georgia to continue until loans originated in georgia before the implementation of these preventive measures become sufficiently seasoned 
a higher level of claim incidence in texas resulted  in part  from unemployment levels that were higher than the national average and from lower home price appreciation 
we believe that claims in the midwest and southeast have been rising and will continue to rise due to the weak industrial sector of the economy 
we also believe that increased claims in michigan and north carolina are a result of declining economic conditions in those areas  and that in colorado  increased claims are a result of a significant decline in property values in that area

our mortgage insurance segment s net income for was million  a decrease of million or from million in this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in net gains on sales of investments  change in fair value of derivative instruments and other income  partially offset by decreases in the provision for losses and policy acquisition costs 
net premiums written and earned 
net premiums written for were million  an million or increase from million for the comparable period of net premiums earned for were million  a million or decrease compared to million for net premiums earned reflect a decrease of million in premiums earned from non traditional products such as second lien mortgages and nims business 
premiums earned from non traditional products were million in  compared to million in due to significant run off in nims business and  until late in the year  a low volume of second lien mortgage business written 
partially offsetting the decline in earned premiums was an increase of million in premiums earned from the primary insurance business as a result of a change in the product mix to higher premium rate products and the acceleration of premiums earned in the third and fourth quarters resulting from the cancellation of policies contained within a large  single premium structured transaction 
premiums earned will fluctuate as the mix of premiums written changes 
for  the mix included a higher percentage of non prime business  which has higher premium rates compared to the prime business because the level of expected loss associated with this type of insurance is higher than the expected loss associated with prime business 
we intend to increase the percentage of non prime risk that is reinsured through smart home arrangements in to the extent we are able to accomplish this  our earned premiums for would be affected commensurate with the amount of premiums ceded 
net investment income 
net investment income attributable to our mortgage insurance business for was million  compared to million for investment income for reflects a higher level of investment expenses and a decrease in dividend income offset by an increase in interest income on bonds 
net gains on sales of investments and change in fair value of derivative instruments 
net gains on sales of investments in our mortgage insurance business were million for  compared to million for this decrease was principally related to the unusually high net gains on sales of investments recorded in as a result of changes in asset allocation and investment execution strategies 
the change in the fair value of derivatives was a gain of million for  compared to a gain of million for  mainly due to the sale of convertible securities with mark to market gains in and changes in the fair value of embedded options in convertible securities held in the investment portfolio due to market conditions

change in the fair value of derivative instruments was a gain of million for compared to a gain of million for this decrease is principally related to our application in the fourth quarter of of a refined model for valuing corporate collateralized debt obligations 
in the fourth quarter of  we refined our mark to market model to reflect actual credit spreads by individual name  when available  as compared to our previous version of the model  which used average spreads for similarly rated names 
while application of the new model resulted in minimal changes for most of our derivative transactions  one high yield synthetic obligation showed a large difference due to greater spread volatility in the high yield corporate names included in this transaction 
at december   our refined model indicated that we had incurred a million loss on this transaction  which was included on our list of intensified surveillance credits at december  on march   radian asset assurance and its counterparty to

our financial guaranty business paid million in insurance claims for and million in claims for related to a single manufactured housing transaction with conseco finance corp  a transaction for which we have established reserves equal to the entire exposure 
we closely monitor our financial guaranty obligations and we use an internal classification process to identify and track troubled credits 
we classify credits as intensified surveillance credits when we determine that continued performance is questionable and  in the absence of a positive change  may result in a claim 
at december  and  the financial guaranty segment had the following exposure on credits classified as intensified surveillance credits december december of credits par outstanding of credits par outstanding in millions less than greater than total we establish loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts as discussed in critical accounting policies reserve for losses in this item and note to our consolidated financial statements

singer s run off operations consist of servicing and or disposing of singer s previously originated assets and servicing its non consolidated special purpose vehicles 
the results of this subsidiary are not material to our financial results 
at december   we had approximately million and million of non consolidated assets and liabilities  respectively  associated with singer special purpose vehicles 
our investment in these special purpose vehicles was million at december  radian asset assurance has assumed the liabilities of another of our insurance subsidiaries  van american insurance company  inc  which had been engaged on a run off basis in reclamation bonds for the coal mining industry and surety bonds covering closure and post closure obligations of landfill operations 
this business is not material to our financial results and has been dissolved as of december   with any remaining policies transferred to radian asset assurance 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  including payments under operating lease agreements  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as liabilities but represent a contractual commitment to pay 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
although the majority of our loss reserves do not represent contractual obligations and commitments under the securities and exchange commission sec definition  they are included in the table because they represent management s estimate of the claims that we will be required to pay on our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty contracts 
the table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt note capital lease obligations operating lease commitments note purchase obligations reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses notes and total our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects the application of accounting policies described in critical accounting policies reserve for losses 
as of december   we have financial guaranty non specific reserves of million that are not included in the table 
the payments due by period are management s estimates and assume that all of the loss reserves included in the table will result in claim payments 

table of contents we also have obligations with respect to our pension  postretirement and other benefit plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have a million unsecured credit facility  comprised of a million day facility that expires on december   and a million five year facility that expires on december  this facility bears interest on any amounts drawn at a rate dependent on our credit rating at the time of such borrowing and will be calculated according to  at the our option  a base rate or a eurocurrency rate  plus an applicable margin and utilization fee 
if necessary  this facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
there have been no drawdowns on this facility as of december  we also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur contingent commitments 
we do not currently expect that these contingent commitments will result in any amounts being paid by us 
we also utilize letters of credit to back assumed reinsurance contracts  medical insurance policies and an excise tax exemption certificate used for ceded premiums from our domestic operations to our international operations 
these letters of credit are with various financial institutions  have terms of one year and will automatically renew unless we specify otherwise 
the letters of credit outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively 
new securities regulations have come into effect that impose enhanced disclosure requirements on issuers of asset backed including mortgaged backed securities  including most customers in our structured business 
to allow these customers to comply with the new regulations  we may be required in any given transaction  depending on the amount of credit enhancement that we are providing  to provide audited financial statements for the insurance subsidiary participating in the transaction 
we are in the process of producing financial statements and having them audited for each of our primary insurance subsidiaries 
we anticipate that these financial statements will be available in the first half of until they are available  we will provide full and unconditional holding company level guaranties for our insurance subsidiaries obligations in such transactions  principally on our mortgage insurance business for which financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have never previously been available 
to date  we have guarantied two structured transactions for radian guaranty involving approximately million of credit exposure 
off balance sheet arrangements we guarantee payments of up to million of a revolving credit facility issued to sherman 
on december  the facility was extended until december  there have been no drawdowns on this facility 
investments we are required to group assets in our investment portfolio into three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments classified as trading securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of income 
for securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  we conduct a quarterly evaluation of declines in market value of the investment portfolio asset basis to determine whether the decline is other than temporary 
this evaluation includes a review of i the length of time and extent to which fair value is below amortized cost  ii issuer financial condition  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment over a period of time to allow recovery in fair value 
we use a decline in price over four continuous quarters as a guide in identifying those securities that should be evaluated for impairment 
for securities that have experienced rapid price declines or unrealized losses of less than over periods in excess of four consecutive quarters  
table of contents classification as other than temporary is considered 
factors influencing this consideration include an analysis of the security issuer s financial performance  financial condition and general economic conditions 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value through earnings as a realized loss and fair value becomes the new basis 
at december  and  there were no investments held in the portfolio that met these criteria 
realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification method and are included in income 
other invested assets consist of residential mortgage backed securities and forward foreign currency contracts and are carried at fair value 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue no

dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  along with income from our investment portfolio and dividends from our affiliates c bass and sherman  are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations 
these obligations include our operating expenses  taxes and interest and principal payments on debt 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in addition  although we have expense sharing arrangements in place with our principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their share of holding company level expenses  including interest expense on our long term debt  these expense sharing arrangements are subject to termination at any time by the applicable state insurance departments 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us  and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  is subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to expense and tax sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations  we may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity or by selling assets  which we may be unable to do on favorable terms  if at all 
the need to raise additional capital or the failure to make timely payments on our obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
during  we received million in dividends from our mortgage insurance operating subsidiaries and a million dividend from radian asset assurance 
we also received a million dividend from one of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries that was declared in our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount that they may pay in dividends to us during the next months without first obtaining insurance department approval 
we have not made any capital contributions to c bass since we acquired our interest in c bass in connection with our acquisition of efsg in february c bass paid million and million of dividends to one of our insurance subsidiaries during and  respectively 
in february  an additional dividend of million was received from c bass 
the distribution of these amounts to us by our insurance subsidiaries is subject to regulatory limitations 
sherman paid million and million of dividends to one of our insurance subsidiaries during and  respectively 
in february  an additional dividend of million was received from sherman 
the distribution of these amounts to us by our insurance subsidiaries is subject to regulatory limitations 
amounts that we ultimately received from our subsidiaries and c bass and sherman during and were used  in part  to fund our stock repurchase programs 

table of contents our insurance subsidiaries are permitted to allocate capital resources within certain insurance department and rating agency guidelines by making direct investments 
in april  radian guaranty invested million in efsg  for an approximate ownership interest 
this amount was subsequently contributed by efsg to radian asset assurance to support growth in the direct financial guaranty business 
in january  we contributed an additional million in capital to efsg that was subsequently contributed to radian asset assurance 
during the first quarter of  efsg transferred its investment in sherman in the form of a dividend to radian guaranty 
in february  we submitted a request to the insurance department of pennsylvania  to contribute approximately million in capital from radian guaranty to radian insurance to support the additional risk that has been written in that entity  mostly through non traditional products by our capital markets and international mortgage business channels 
in february  upon receiving approval for radian europe ltd 
a subsidiary of radian insurance  radian insurance contributed million in capital to radian europe ltd 
to fund its operations 
short term liquidity needs our liquidity needs over the next months include funds for the payment of dividends on our common stock  debt service payments on our outstanding long term debt  claim payments on our insured obligations and operating expenses 
we expect to fund these requirements with amounts received under our expense sharing arrangements or as dividends from our insurance operating subsidiaries  which include dividends to these subsidiaries from our affiliates c bass and sherman  and from working capital  all of which we expect to be sufficient to make such payments for at least the next months 
based on our current intention to pay quarterly common stock dividends of approximately per share and assuming that our common stock outstanding remains constant at  shares outstanding at december   we would require approximately million to pay our next four quarterly dividends 
we will also require approximately million annually to pay the debt service on our outstanding long term debt 
our sources of working capital consist mostly of premiums written by our insurance operating subsidiaries and investment income at both the parent company and operating subsidiary levels 
working capital is applied mainly to the payment of our insurance operating subsidiaries claims  operating expenses and to fund our stock repurchase programs 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the lower cash flow from operations in resulted mainly from the payment of million as a result of the recapture of previously ceded business that occurred in the first quarter of coupled with higher claims paid and operating expenditures 
in  we paid million as a result of the recapture of previously ceded business that occurred in the first quarter of positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and other expenses 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our insurance subsidiaries will provide those subsidiaries with sufficient funds to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for at least the next months 
in the unlikely event that claim payment obligations and operating expenses exceed the operating cash flows generated by our insurance operating subsidiaries  we believe that we have the ability to fund any excess from sales of short term investments 
at december   we had cash and liquid investment securities of million 
in the unlikely event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of short term investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid securities held by us 
in any event  we do not anticipate the need for borrowings  under credit facilities or otherwise  to satisfy claim payment obligations or other operating expenses 
we plan to continue to invest in significant information technology and infrastructure upgrades over the next two years at an estimated total cost of million to million  which is intended to benefit all of our business segments 
in addition  we are making significant investments in upgrading our business continuity plan 
we expect to use cash flows from operations to fund these expenditures 

table of contents long term liquidity needs our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next twelve months is the repayment of the principal amount of our outstanding long term debt 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs using excess working capital  sales of investments  borrowings under our credit facility or through the private or public issuance of debt or equity securities 
in february  the sec declared effective our million universal shelf registration statement

on december   we amended the facility to extend the expiration date of the day facility from december  to december  the five year facility expires on december  there were no drawdowns on the expired facility  and we have not drawn down any amounts under the new facility through december  our ability to borrow under the new facility is subject to compliance with all applicable covenants 
the new facility bears interest on any amounts drawn down at a rate dependent on our credit rating at the time of such borrowing 
this rate will be calculated according to  at our option  a base rate or a eurocurrency rate  plus an applicable margin and utilization fee

in september  radian asset assurance closed on million of money market committed preferred custodial trust securities  pursuant to which it entered into a series of three perpetual put options on its own preferred stock to radian asset securities inc radian asset securities  our wholly owned subsidiary 
radian asset securities in turn entered into a series of three perpetual put options on its own preferred stock on substantially identical terms to the radian asset assurance preferred stock 
the counterparties to the radian asset securities put options are three trusts established by two major investment banks 
the trusts were created 
table of contents as a vehicle for providing capital support to radian asset assurance by allowing radian asset assurance to obtain immediate access to additional capital at its sole discretion at any time through the exercise of one or more of the put options and the corresponding exercise of one or more corresponding radian asset securities put options 
if the radian asset assurance put options were exercised  radian asset securities  through the radian asset assurance preferred stock thereby acquired  and investors  through their equity investment in the radian asset securities preferred stock  would have rights to the assets of radian asset assurance of an equity investor in radian asset assurance 
such rights would be subordinate to policyholders claims  as well as to claims of general unsecured creditors of radian asset assurance  but ahead of the parent company s claims  through efsg  as the owner of the common stock of radian asset assurance 
if all the radian asset assurance put options were exercised  radian asset assurance would receive up to million in return for the issuance of its own perpetual preferred stock  the proceeds of which would be useable for any purpose  including the payment of claims 
dividend payments on the preferred stock will be cumulative only if radian asset assurance pays dividends on its common stock 
each trust will be restricted to holding high quality  short term commercial paper investments to ensure that it can meet its obligations under the put option

reconciliation of net income to cash flows from operations the following table reconciles net income to cash flows from operations for the years ended december  and in thousands december december net income decrease in reserves deferred tax provision cash paid for clawback increase in unearned premiums increase in deferred policy acquisition costs equity in earnings of affiliates distributions from affiliates net gains on sales and change in fair value of derivatives increase in prepaid federal income taxes depreciation and amortization  net other cash flows from operations cash item 
cash flows from operations for the year ended have increased compared to the comparable period of an increasing portion of our net income has been derived from our equity in earnings of affiliates  which is a non cash item 
this has been partially offset by higher distributions from our affiliates 
cash flows from operations also increased as a result of an increase in premiums received  lower claim payments and lower net payments on the settlement of derivative financial guaranty contracts 
we do not expect net income to greatly exceed cash flows from operations in the future 
stock repurchase programs since september  our board of directors has authorized five separate repurchase programs for the repurchase  in the aggregate  of up to million shares of our common stock on the open market

at december   we had repurchased all million shares authorized under the fourth repurchase program announced august  at a cost of approximately million 
all share repurchases made to date were funded from available working capital  and were made from time to time depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a fifth repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock on the open market under a new repurchase plan 
stock purchases under this program will be funded from available working capital and will be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  stock price and other factors 
the board did not set an expiration date for this program 
we also may purchase shares on the open market to meet option exercise obligations and to fund k matches and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and may consider additional stock repurchase programs in the future

critical accounting policies sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses as described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  we establish reserves to provide for losses and the estimated costs of settling claims in both the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty businesses 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
in our mortgage insurance business  reserves for losses generally are not established until we are notified that a borrower has missed two payments 
we also establish reserves for associated loss adjustment expenses lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer and macroeconomic factors such as regional economic conditions that involve 
table of contents significant variability over time  as well as more static factors such as the estimated foreclosure period in the area where the default exists  to help determine the appropriate loss reserve at any point in time 
with respect to delinquent loans that are in an early stage of delinquency  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
adjustments in estimates for delinquent loans in the early stage of delinquency are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of delinquency 
as the delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the delinquent loan and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
if a default cures  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
this curing process causes an appearance of a reduction in reserves from prior years if the reduction in reserves from cures is greater than the additional reserves for those loans that are nearing foreclosure or have become claims 
we also reserve for defaults that we believe to have occurred but that have not been reported  using historical information on defaults not reported on a timely basis by lending institutions 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 
we generally do not establish reserves for mortgages that are in default if we believe we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
consistent with gaap and industry accounting practices  we generally do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default or believed to be in default 
in january  we implemented a revised modeling process to assist us in establishing reserves in the mortgage insurance business 
in recent years  with the growth in the alt a and non prime business  we realized that the change in the portfolio mix required us to segment the portfolio and evaluate the reserves required for each differently 
the previous model had been designed for a prime product only and needed to be updated with many years of additional data 
the revised model differentiates between prime and non prime products and takes into account the different loss development patterns and borrower behavior that is inherent in these products  whether we are in a first or second loss position and whether there are deductibles on the loan 
the model calculates a range of reserves by product and a midpoint for each product based on historical factors 
in determining the amount of reserve to be recorded  we begin with the calculated midpoint and then we evaluate other conditions  such as current economic conditions  regional housing conditions and the reliability of historical data for new products  to determine if an adjustment to the midpoint calculated by the model is necessary 
the new model did not result in an adjustment to the overall reserve for losses that we recorded 
at december   we made a judgment to reserve at a level slightly above the midpoint  given the uncertainty around the ultimate performance of our non prime products  the potential overpricing in certain housing markets and the uncertainty around hurricane related defaults 
we establish loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts 
we establish case reserves for specifically identified impaired credits that have defaulted and allocated non specific reserves for specific credits that we expect to default 
in addition  we establish unallocated non specific reserves for our entire portfolio based on estimated statistical loss probabilities 
as discussed below  the reserving policies used by the financial guaranty industry are continuing to evolve and are subject to change 
our financial guaranty loss reserve policy requires management to make the following key estimates and judgments setting both case reserves and allocated non specific reserves requires us to exercise judgment in estimating the severity of the claim that is likely to result from an identified reserving event  which may be any amount up to the full amount of the insured obligation 
the reliability of this estimate depends on the reliability of the information regarding the likely severity of the claim and the judgments made by management with respect to that information 
even when we are aware of the occurrence of an event that requires the establishment of a reserve  our estimate of the severity of the claim that is likely to result from that event may not be correct 
at december   we had case and lae reserves on financial guaranty policies of million 
of this amount  million was attributable to a single manufactured housing transaction originated and serviced by conseco finance corp 
we have a high degree of certainty that we will suffer losses 
table of contents with respect to this insured obligation equal to the amount reserved  which equals the total amount of the remaining insured obligation 
the case and lae reserves also include million attributable to reinsured obligations on which our total par outstanding is million 
these reserves are established based on amounts conveyed to us by the ceding companies and confirmed by us 
we do not have any reasonable expectation that the ultimate losses will deviate materially from the amount reserved 
the remaining million of case and lae reserves is attributable to two insured obligations for which we have lae reserves established partially offset by salvage recoveries on two other insured obligations 
at december   three credits were included in our allocated non specific reserves 
we expect that we will suffer losses with respect to these insured obligations equal to the amount reserved of million 
these credits have a par amount of million 
our unallocated non specific reserves are established over time by applying expected default factors to the premiums earned during each reporting period 
the expected lifetime losses for each credit are determined by multiplying the expected frequency of losses on that credit by the expected severity of losses on that credit and multiplying this number  the loss factor  by that credit s outstanding par amount 
the expected frequency and severity of losses for each credit is generated from three sources two that are published by major rating agencies and one that is generated by a proprietary internal model based on the product class  published rating and term to maturity for each credit 
we set the expected lifetime losses for each credit at the approximate midpoint of the range between the highest and lowest expected lifetime loss factors generated by the rating agency and internally generated models 
the default rates published by rating agencies tend to be very low because we mostly insure investment grade obligations that  historically  have a very low probability of default 
although the default rate is low  the amount of losses upon default can be very high because we tend to insure large financial obligations 
because of the low incidence of losses on financial guaranty obligations  it is also very difficult to estimate the timing of losses on our insured obligations for which we have not yet established a case reserve or allocated non specific reserve 
the default factors for the years ended december   and approximated of earned premiums on public finance credits and of earned premiums on structured finance credits 
our unallocated non specific loss reserve at december   was million 
the range between the unallocated non specific reserves that would have resulted from applying the highest and lowest default factors generated by any of the three models was approximately million to million  which we believe provides a reasonably likely range of expected losses 
none of the product types insured by us accounted for a materially disproportionate share of the variability within that range 
at each balance sheet date  we also evaluate both the model generated default factors and our unallocated non specific reserves against management s subjective view of qualitative factors to ensure that the default factors and the unallocated non specific reserves represent management s best estimate of the expected losses on our portfolio of credits for which we have not established a case reserve or an allocated non specific reserve 
these qualitative factors include existing economic and business conditions  overall credit quality trends resulting from industry  geographic  economic and political conditions  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  changes in underwriting policies and procedures and seasoning of the book of business 
the macroeconomic factors that we evaluate are outside of our control and are subject to considerable variability 
our specific factors that we evaluate also require that we make subjective judgments 
in addition  a significant change in the size of our portfolio underlying the unallocated non specific reserves  such as through the expiration of policies or the refunding or recapture of insured exposures  could require an adjustment to the default factors or our level of unallocated non specific reserves 
to date  our evaluation of these qualitative factors has not led us to adjust the default factors or our level of unallocated non specific reserves 
our estimate of our reserves for losses and lae for financial guaranty s other lines of business  principally trade credit reinsurance  depend upon the receipt of accurate reports and individual loss estimates from ceding companies 
the time lag in receiving reports on individual loss estimates in trade credit reinsurance is generally three to six months 
we use historical loss information and make inquiries to the cedants of known events as a means of validating our loss assumptions while 
table of contents awaiting more formal updated reports 
any differences in viewpoints are resolved expeditiously and have historically not resulted in material adjustments 
in addition  a reserve is included for losses and lae ibnr  on trade credit reinsurance 
setting the loss reserves in both business segments involves significant reliance upon estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
the models and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
in january and february  we discussed with the sec staff  both separately and together with other members of the financial guaranty industry  the differences in loss reserve practices followed by different financial guaranty industry participants 
on june   the fasb added a project to its agenda to consider the accounting by insurers for financial guaranty insurance 
the fasb will consider several aspects of the insurance accounting model  including claims liability recognition  premium recognition and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
in addition  we also understand that the fasb may expand the scope of this project to include income recognition and loss reserving methodology in the mortgage insurance industry 
proposed and final guidance from the fasb regarding accounting for financial guaranty insurance is expected to be issued in when and if the fasb or the sec reaches a conclusion on these issues  we and the rest of the financial guaranty industry may be required to change some aspects of our accounting policies 
if the fasb or the sec were to determine that we should account for our financial guaranty contracts differently  for example by requiring them to be treated solely as one or the other of short duration or long duration contracts under sfas no 
 this determination could impact our accounting for loss reserves  premium revenue and deferred acquisition costs  all of which are covered by sfas no 
management is unable to estimate what impact  if any  the ultimate resolution of this issue will have on our financial condition or operating results 
derivative instruments and hedging activity we account for derivatives under sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
some of the fixed maturity securities included in our investment portfolio and certain of our financial guaranty contracts are considered derivatives 
under sfas no 
 the convertible debt and redeemable preferred securities included in our investment portfolio must be characterized as hybrid securities because they generally combine both debt and equity characteristics 
the hybrid classification requires that the convertible security valuation be separated into a fixed income component and an equity derivative component 
valuation changes on the fixed income component are recorded as other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets while valuation changes on the equity derivative component are recorded as net gains and losses on our statements of income 
we believe that the market valuation of each hybrid convertible security is appropriately allocated to its fixed income and equity derivative components 
the gains and losses on the equity derivative component of the security are determined by a third party investment manager using an industry standard option pricing model 
the gains and losses on direct derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models 
the gains and losses on assumed derivative financial guaranty contracts are provided by the primary insurance companies 
with respect to our direct derivative financial guaranty contracts  estimated fair value amounts are determined by us using market information to the extent available  and appropriate valuation methodologies 
for cdo s  credit spreads on individual names in our collateral pool are used to determine an equivalent risk tranche on an industry standard credit default swap index 
we then estimate the price of our equivalent risk tranche based on observable market prices of standard risk tranches on the industry standard credit default swap index 
when credit spreads on individual names are not available  the average credit spread on the credit rating of the name is used 
for certain structured transactions  dealer quotes on similar structured transactions are used 
significant differences may exist with respect to the available market information and assumptions used to determine gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts we 
table of contents could realize in a current market exchange due to the lack of a liquid market 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we refined our mark to market model to use actual credit spreads by individual name  when available as discussed above  as compared to our previous version of the model  which used average spreads for similarly rated names 
while application of the new model resulted in minimal changes for most of our derivative transactions  one synthetic collateralized debt obligation showed a large difference due to greater spread volatility in the underlying high yield corporate names included in this transaction 
at december   our refined model indicated that a million loss should be recognized on this transaction  which was included on our list of intensified surveillance credits at december  on march   radian asset assurance and its counterparty to this transaction terminated this transaction and amended the one other derivative financial guaranty contract insured by radian asset assurance with this same counterparty

a summary of our derivative information as of and for the periods indicated is as follows december in millions balance sheet trading securities amortized cost fair value derivative financial guaranty contracts notional value gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses net unrealized gains the components of the change in fair value of derivative instruments are as follows year ended december in millions income statement trading securities gain on termination of treasury rate lock derivative financial guaranty contracts net gains the following table presents information at december  and related to net unrealized gains losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts included in assets or liabilities  as appropriate  on our consolidated balance sheets

table of contents the application of sfas no 
 as amended  could result in volatility from period to period in gains and losses as reported on our consolidated statements of income 
these gains and losses are mostly the result of changes in corporate credit spreads  changes in the creditworthiness of underlying corporate entities  and the equity performance of the entities underlying the convertible investments 
any incurred gains or losses on such contracts would be recognized as a change in the fair value of derivatives 
we are unable to predict the effect this volatility may have on our financial position or results of operations 
we record premiums and origination costs related to credit default swaps and certain other financial guaranty contracts in premiums written and policy acquisition costs  respectively  on our consolidated statements of income 
see results of operations financial guaranty 
our classification of these contracts is the same whether we are a direct insurer or we assume these contracts 
in accordance with our risk management policies  we entered into derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk related to the issuance of certain long term debt 
as of december   there were two interest rate swap contracts relating to our unsecured senior notes due these interest rate swaps are designed as fair value hedges that hedge the change in fair value of the debt arising from interest rate movements 
during and  the fair value hedges were effective 
therefore  the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of income were offset by the change in the fair value of the hedged debt 
these interest rate swap contracts mature in february we had no interest rate swaps in effect in terms of the interest rate swap contracts at december  were as follows dollars in thousands notional amount rate received fixed rate paid floating a maturity date february  unrealized loss a the december  six month london interbank offered rate libor forward rate at the next swap payment date plus basis points 
in october  we entered into transactions to lock in treasury rates that would have served as a hedge in the event we issued long term debt during such time 
the notional value of the hedges was million at a blended rate of 
at december   we had a million unrealized gain recorded on the hedges 
in january  we discontinued the hedge arrangements and received payments from our counterparties 
we realized a gain of million at termination in deferred policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance business  consisting of compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and reported as deferred policy acquisition costs 
because sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  amortization of these costs for each underwriting year book of business is charged against revenue in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
this includes accruing interest on the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs 
estimates of expected gross profit including persistency and loss development assumptions for each underwriting year used as a basis for amortization are evaluated regularly  and the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted by a charge or credit to the statement of income if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
considerable judgment is used in evaluating these factors when updating the assumptions 
the use of different assumptions would have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 

table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs in our financial guaranty business are comprised of those expenses that vary with  and are principally related to  the production of insurance premiums  including commissions paid on reinsurance assumed  salaries and related costs of underwriting and marketing personnel  rating agency fees  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses  offset by commission income on premiums ceded to reinsurers 
acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned for each underwriting year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is adjusted regularly based on the expected timing of both upfront and installment based premiums 
the estimation of installment based premiums requires considerable judgment  and different assumptions could produce different results 
origination costs for derivative financial guaranty contracts are expensed as incurred 
as noted under reserve for losses above  the fasb is considering the accounting model used by the financial guaranty industry for deferred policy acquisition costs

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
examples of market risk include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our financial instruments  including in particular  investment securities and certain financial guaranty insurance contracts 
this analysis is performed by expressing the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
our sensitivity analysis is sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in yield curve with all other factors remaining constant 
the results of our sensitivity analysis at december  are as follows interest rate risk the primary market risk in our investment portfolio is interest rate risk  namely the fair value sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk through active investment portfolio management to ensure a prudent mix of fixed income investments with a varied maturity schedule 
we estimate the changes in fair value of our fixed income securities by projecting an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates 
the carrying value of our total investment portfolio as of december  and december   was billion for each year  of which and  respectively  was invested in fixed maturities 
we manage our investment portfolio to minimize exposure to interest rates through active portfolio management and intensive monitoring of investments to ensure a proper mix of the types of securities held and to stagger the maturities of fixed income securities 
our analysts estimate the payout pattern of the mortgage insurance loss reserves to determine their duration  which is measured by the weighted average payments expressed in years 
as of december  the average duration of the fixed income portfolio was years 
as of december   hypothetical increases in interest rates of and basis points would cause decreases in the market value of our fixed income portfolio excluding short term investments of approximately and  respectively 
similarly  hypothetical decreases in interest rates of and basis points would cause increases in the market value of our fixed income portfolio of approximately and  respectively 
in april  we entered into interest rate swaps that  in effect  converted a portion of our fixed rate long term debt to a variable rate based on a spread over the six month libor for the remaining term of the debt 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the market value and cost of our long term debt at december  were million and million  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk one means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis 
we analyzed our currency exposure as of december  by identifying our investment portfolio denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our investment portfolio foreign currency exposures were remeasured  generally assuming a decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
under this model  with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated as of december   that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in foreign currencies by million 
equity market price exposure to changes in equity market prices can be estimated by assessing the potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 
table of contents 
at december   the market value and cost of our equity securities were million and million  respectively 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decline in equity market prices would decrease the market value of our equity investments by approximately million  based on our equity positions as of december  credit derivative risk we enter into credit default swaps  which include certain derivative financial guaranty contracts written through our financial guaranty business 
gains and losses on our credit default swaps are derived from market pricing when available  otherwise  we use internally generated pricing models 
both methods take into account credit and market spreads and are recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value is determined using our mark to market model which uses active market spreads 
a widening of of the market spreads associated with these credit default swaps would cause the fair value to decrease by million at december  see critical accounting policies derivative instruments and hedging activity for a discussion of how we account for derivatives under sfas no
