in process research and development charge ipr d on acquisition of saime in may  we recognized as an expense a charge of million with respect to ipr d programs under active development by saime that  at date of acquisition  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value assigned to ipr d was based on an independent appraisal and was comprised of the following projects in thousands project value of ipr d upgrade of the elisee series of ventilators next generation of portable ventilators total the value of ipr d was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established  estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products  discounting the net cash flows to present value  and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto 
the discount rate used in the analysis was  which was based on the risk profile of the acquired assets 
as of the date of acquisition  these projects had estimated costs to complete totaling approximately million 
the projects were in various stages of development but are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from one to three years 
we believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets were reasonable at the time of acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues  development costs or profitability  or events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the projected results 
stock based compensation costs we have granted stock options to personnel  including officers and directors  under both our option plan and our equity participation plan  which we refer to collectively as the plans 
these options have expiration dates of ten years from the date of grant and vest over three or four years 
we granted these options with an exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant 
we have also offered to our personnel  including officers and directors  the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
prior to july   we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  in accounting for our equity plans 
for periods prior to july   we complied with the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no stock based employee compensation cost was reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the 
table of contents underlying common stock on the date of grant or within permitted discounted prices as it pertains to the espp 
results for periods before july  have not been restated to reflect  and do not include the impact of  sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
while our financial statements through june  account for stock option grants pursuant to apb no 
 in accordance with sfas no 
 we disclose in the notes to our financial statements the pro forma impact on our net income had we accounted for stock option grants using the fair value based method of accounting 
as of july   we adopted sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation expense of all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and amortization of the fair value over the vesting period of the award 
under the prospective method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption  determined under the original provisions of sfas no 
 shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the graded attribution method for stock based awards granted prior to july  and the straight line method for stock based awards granted after july  the application of sfas r had the following effect on reported amounts relative to amounts that would have been reported under previous accounting in thousands  except per share data under previous accounting sfas r adjustments as reported cost of sales operating expenses selling  general and administration research and development income from operations income before income taxes net income inventories  net earnings per share basic diluted cashflow from operating activities cashflow from financing activities 
table of contents the fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under our espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions years ended june stock options weighted average fair value weighted average risk free interest rate dividend yield expected option life in years volatility espp purchase rights weighted average risk free interest rate dividend yield expected option life months months volatility expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and implied volatilities from traded options of our stock 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 
the guidance in sfas no 
r is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized 
to date  a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was in fiscal year  and during fiscal years  and  our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately and approximately 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and future effective tax rates will depend upon  numerous factors  including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a australian tax deduction is available  the level of non deductible expenses  and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made the decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to take advantage of a temporary incentive under the american jobs creation act of this temporary incentive provides an exclusion from us taxable income for qualifying dividends received from controlled foreign corporations 
the repatriation of million resulted in a one time additional income tax expense of million for the year ended june  the repatriation of these funds to the united states provides us with increased flexibility in the utilization of cash to further its strategic objectives 

table of contents we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

the results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies 
changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations 
we are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts 
stock split on august   our board of directors declared a two for one split of our common stock which was effected in the form of a stock dividend 
stockholders received one additional share of common stock for every share held of record on september  all share numbers and per share amounts contained in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split 
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  goodwill  impaired assets  intangible assets  income taxes  deferred tax valuation allowances  contingencies and stock based compensation costs 

table of contents we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
provision for warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model  which takes into consideration actual  historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although we engage in product improvement programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment  at which time title transfers to the customer 
revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is 
table of contents not recorded until acceptance is received 
royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned 
service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract 
revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract 
revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract 
freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue 
all freight related expenses are charged to cost of sales 
we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities 
however  as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders  one time special pricing to support new product introductions  sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price breaks for regular order volumes 
the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products 
these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force 
we do not sell our products to these representatives  and do not recognize revenue on such shipments 
our products are predominantly therapy based equipment and require no installation 
as such  we have no significant installation obligations 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with sfas r  we measure the compensation of all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant 
such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including the type of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in sfas r  or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp

we transact business in various foreign currencies  including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar 
we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities and manufacturing expenditures 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in euro s and the australian dollar 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities  and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
we have determined our hedge program to be a non effective hedge as defined under sfas no
