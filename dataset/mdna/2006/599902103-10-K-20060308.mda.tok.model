item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations contains forward looking statements  including statements about our growth and future operating results  discovery and development of products  strategic alliances and intellectual property 
for this purpose  any statement that is not a statement of historical fact should be considered a forward looking statement 
we often used the words believe  anticipate  plan  expect  intend  may  will and similar expressions to help identify forward looking statements 
actual results may differ from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors  including  without limitation  those factors discussed in this annual report under the heading risk factors that may affect results 
overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing innovative products in disease areas with unmet medical needs 
we currently market velcade  the market leader in the multiple myeloma relapsed setting 
we have a development pipeline of seven clinical and preclinical product candidates in our therapeutic focus areas of cancer and inflammation and we have an oncology focused discovery organization 
strategic business relationships are a key component of our business 
on october   we announced our refined business strategy to focus on advancing key growth assets  including velcade  our clinical and preclinical pipeline in oncology and inflammation molecules and our oncology focused discovery organization 
as part of our refined strategy  we have taken and will continue to take steps to reduce total annual research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in by from and from these steps build on our restructured relationship with schering corporation and schering plough ltd  together referred to as sgp 
we reduced the size of our company from  employees at the end of to approximately  employees at the end of  by managing attrition  eliminating integrilin sales and marketing positions  and reducing the number of positions in inflammation discovery and business support groups 
in addition  we are evaluating the potential of further consolidation of our cambridge  massachusetts based facilities 
we expect the total restructuring charge resulting from the refined strategy to be between approximately million and million  primarily consisting of facilities costs and employee termination benefits 
we recorded approximately million of this charge in and we expect to record the remaining charge of between and million in we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives and as a result  future restructuring charges could vary significantly from current expectations 
on september   sgp obtained the exclusive us development and commercialization rights for integrilin products from us and paid us a nonrefundable upfront payment of approximately million 
we receive royalties on net product sales of integrilin in the united states from sgp for so long as sgp is engaged in the commercialization and sale of an integrilin product in the united states  with the potential of receiving royalties beyond the patent expiration date 
in and  minimum royalty payments for each year are set at approximately million 
there are no guaranteed minimum royalty payments beyond in addition  upon closing the sgp transaction in the third quarter of  we recognized strategic alliance revenue of approximately million in connection with the sale to sgp of our existing integrilin raw materials and finished goods inventory  and sgp assumed development responsibilities relating to the product 
we continue to manage the supply of product for integrilin at the expense of sgp for products sold in the sgp territories 
we expect our new relationship with sgp to be at least financially equivalent to the former co promotion arrangement  taking into account the expected future revenues and anticipated costs savings 
strategically  our goal in restructuring the relationship was to increase the near term certainty of revenues from integrilin through the guaranteed minimum royalties for and  while eliminating the need to further invest our resources into integrilin sales and marketing and development activities 
our overall business strategy is to build a portfolio of innovative  new medicines based on our understanding of particular molecular pathways that affect the establishment and progression of specific diseases 
these molecular pathways include the related effects of proteins on cellular performance  reproduction and death 
we plan to develop and commercialize many of our products on our own  but will seek development and commercial collaborators on favorable terms or when we otherwise believe that doing so would be advantageous to us 
for example  we generally intend to enter into sales and marketing alliances with major pharmaceutical companies for products in disease areas that require large sales forces or for markets outside of the united states 
in the near term  we expect to focus our commercial activities in cancer where we plan to build on our commercial and regulatory experience with velcade 
we also are working to obtain approval to market velcade in the united states and  through ortho biotech products  lp  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  or ortho biotech  elsewhere for initial treatment of multiple myeloma and for the treatment of additional cancer types 
we believe that these additional uses of velcade would lead to a significant expansion of our cancer business 
in inflammatory disease  we are advancing novel product candidates in clinical development as potential treatments for serious and widely prevalent conditions 
in the long term  we expect to bring new products to market on a regular basis from our pipeline of discovery and development stage programs and expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our pipeline through in licensing and acquisitions 
if we are successful  we would use the revenues from this expanding portfolio of marketed products to broaden the scope of our operations 
velcade velcade  the first of a new class of medicines called proteasome inhibitors  was the first treatment in more than a decade to be approved in the united states for patients with multiple myeloma 
we received accelerated approval from the food and drug administration  or fda  on may  to market velcade for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy  commonly referred to as third line and beyond 
this approval was subject to the completion of and submission of data from the phase iii apex clinical trial 
in march  we received approval from the fda of our supplemental new drug application  or snda  for velcade for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy  commonly referred to as second line 
this regulatory decision also marks the completion of the may post approval requirements 
in april  the european commission granted marketing authorization for velcade for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy in europe 
under this authorization  a single license was granted to millennium for marketing velcade in the member states of the european union  plus norway and iceland 
velcade was also approved for marketing in the ten accession member countries when those countries officially joined the european union on may  velcade has also been approved in a number of other countries  including countries within latin america and south east asia  bringing the total number of approved countries to more than in april  our collaborator  ortho biotech  received approval from the european commission for velcade as a monotherapy for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation 
the fda granted velcade fast track designation for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma  an aggressive form of non hodgkin s lymphoma  in november  due to the high unmet medical need of these patients and based on the strength of data for velcade in its clinical trials 
this designation allows the fda to accept on a rolling basis portions of a marketing application for review prior to the submission of a final document 
we expect to file a snda for velcade as a monotherapy for the treatment of relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma during the second half of our alliances ortho biotech collaboration in june  we entered into an agreement with ortho biotech to collaborate on the commercialization of and through the agreement with johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  llc  or jjprd  continue clinical development of velcade 
under the terms of the agreement  we retain all commercialization rights to velcade in the united states 
ortho biotech and its affiliate  janssen cilag  have agreed to commercialize velcade outside of the united states and janssen pharmaceutical kk is responsible for japan 
we receive distribution fees from ortho biotech and its affiliates from sales of velcade outside of the united states 
we retain an option to co promote velcade with ortho biotech at a future date in specified european countries 
we are engaged with jjprd in an extensive global program for further clinical development of velcade with the purpose of maximizing the commercial potential of velcade 
this program is investigating the potential of velcade to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological tumors  including continued clinical development of velcade for multiple myeloma 
jjprd was responsible for of the joint development costs through and is responsible for of those costs after in addition  we may receive payments from ortho biotech for achieving clinical development milestones  regulatory milestones outside of the united states or milestones based upon agreed upon sales levels of velcade 
integrilin through august   we co promoted integrilin in the united states in collaboration with sgp  and shared profits and losses 
as of september   sgp markets integrilin in the united states and specified other areas outside of the european union 
glaxosmithkline plc  or gsk  markets integrilin in the european union under a license from us 
sgp collaboration in april  cor therapeutics  inc  or cor  entered into a collaboration agreement with sgp to jointly develop and commercialize integrilin on a worldwide basis 
we acquired cor in february under our original agreement with sgp  we generally shared any profits or losses from sales in the united states with sgp based on the amount of promotional efforts that each party contributed 
since the united states launch of integrilin in june  we shared promotional efforts in the united states equally with sgp  except for costs associated with marketing programs specific to us 
after september   under our amended collaboration agreement with sgp  we began receiving royalties on sales of integrilin in the united states 
sgp continues to pay us royalties on sales of integrilin in specified territories outside of the european union and reimburses us for manufacturing related costs for integrilin 
gsk license agreement in june  we reacquired the rights to market integrilin in europe from sgp and concurrently entered into a license agreement granting gsk exclusive marketing rights to integrilin in europe 
in january  the transition of the integrilin marketing authorizations for the european union from sgp to gsk was completed  and gsk began selling integrilin in the countries of the european union 
gsk also markets integrilin in other european countries where it has received approval of the transfer from sgp to gsk of the relevant marketing authorizations 
under the terms of the agreement  we have received license fees and are entitled to future royalties from gsk on integrilin sales in europe subject to the achievement of specified objectives 
under the license agreement with gsk  decisions regarding the ongoing marketing of integrilin are generally subject to the oversight of a joint steering committee with equal membership from gsk and us 
however  gsk has significant final decision making authority with respect to european marketing issues 
our agreement with gsk continues until the later of december   or as long as gsk continues to commercialize integrilin in any european country 
sanofi aventis inflammatory disease discovery collaboration in june  we entered into a broad agreement in the field of inflammatory disease with aventis  now sanofi aventis  which includes joint discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of specified inflammatory diseases 
this agreement covers a substantial portion of our development program in the inflammatory disease area and provides us with potential access to sanofi aventis large promotional infrastructure in connection with the commercialization of jointly developed products 
the discovery phase of the agreement expired on october  however  we and sanofi aventis are continuing a limited research program covering three advanced preclinical candidates discovered through the research program collaboration 
the development and commercialization programs continue under the agreement 
as provided in the original agreement  in north america  we have agreed to share the responsibility for and cost of developing  manufacturing and marketing products arising from the alliance 
outside of north america  sanofi aventis is responsible for and will bear the cost of developing  manufacturing and marketing products arising from the alliance 
sanofi aventis is required to pay us a royalty on product sales outside of north america 
under this agreement  sanofi aventis acquired million shares of our common stock over a two year period through for million 
to date  we and sanofi aventis have identified a significant number of novel drug targets relevant in inflammatory diseases 
during the remaining portion of the development phase of the alliance  we and sanofi aventis have agreed to focus our joint resources on preclinical and clinical development of candidates identified in the collaboration 
as of the end of  the alliance had identified several development candidates  two of which  mln and mln are now being tested by us in phase i clinical trials 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  our co promotion collaboration through august   our strategic alliances and from royalties based on net sales of licensed products 
we divide our revenue arrangements with multiple elements into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
we classify advance payments received in excess of amounts earned as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize revenue from the sale of velcade in the united states when delivery has occurred and title has transferred 
we record allowances as a reduction to product sales for product returns  chargebacks and discounts at the time of sale 
as velcade is a fairly new product  we estimate product returns based on historical return patterns as they become available 
velcade returns are expected to be generally low because the shelf life for the product is months in the united states and we expect wholesalers not to significantly stock inventory due to the expensive nature of the product 
additionally  we consider several factors in our estimation process including our internal sales forecasts  inventory levels as provided by wholesalers and third party market research data 
during the fourth quarter of  we began distributing velcade through a sole source distribution model 
as we continually monitor actual product returns and inventory levels in the domestic distribution channel  we have reduced and may  from time to time in the future  reduce our product returns estimate 
doing so would result in increased product sales at the time the return estimate is changed 
if circumstances change or conditions become more competitive in the market for therapeutic products that address multiple myeloma  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates 
doing so would result in an incremental reduction of product sales at the time the return estimate is changed 
our accruals for rebates  chargebacks  and other discounts were immaterial at december  through august   we recognized co promotion revenue based on sgp s reported shipments of integrilin to wholesalers 
co promotion revenue included our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin and reimbursements of our manufacturing related costs  development costs and advertising and promotional expenses 
we communicated with sgp to calculate our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin on a monthly basis 
the calculation included estimates of the amount of advertising and promotional expenses and other costs incurred on a monthly basis 
adjustments to our estimates were based upon actual information that we received subsequent to our reporting deadlines 
our estimates were adjusted on a monthly basis and historically the adjustments were not significant due to frequent communication with sgp 
we recognize nonrefundable upfront licensing fees and guaranteed  time based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of research and development  manufacturing or other commercialization efforts by us as strategic alliance revenue ratably over the development period if development risk is significant  ratably over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development risk has been substantially eliminated  or based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  management estimates the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we continually review these estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and the amount of revenue recognized 
milestone payments are recognized as strategic alliance revenue when the performance obligations  as defined in the contract  are achieved 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
reimbursements of research and development costs are recognized as strategic alliance revenue as the related costs are incurred 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we have rights 
these license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product and we record royalty revenues based on estimates of sales from interim data provided by licensees 
beginning september   upon closing the amended collaboration agreement with sgp  we began recording royalty revenues as a separate line item in our statement of operations 
going forward  we will perform an analysis of historical royalties we have been paid  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues will be adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
we do not expect these adjustments to be significant 
to the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate royalty revenue  we will record royalties on a cash basis 
inventory inventory consists of currently marketed products and from time to time product candidates awaiting regulatory approval which were capitalized based upon management s judgment of probable near term commercialization 
we assess the probability of commercialization based upon several factors including estimated launch date  time to manufacture and shelf life 
at december  and december   inventory does not include amounts for products that had not been approved for sale 
inventories primarily represent raw materials used in production  work in process and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at cost  for velcade  raw material used in production and work in process  valued at cost  for integrilin to supply gsk and limited amounts of work in process  valued at cost  for integrilin to supply sgp 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical 
our current sales projections provide for full utilization of the inventory balance 
if product sales levels differ from projections or a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
intangible assets we have acquired significant intangible assets that we value and record 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that are specifically identified and have alternative future uses are capitalized 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets at acquisition 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we engage independent valuation experts who review our critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach when impairment indicators arise 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill on october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date 
however  since the date of acquisition of cor  which generated a significant amount of goodwill  we have experienced a significant decline in market capitalization due to a decline in stock price 
we continually monitor business and market conditions  including the restructured relationship with sgp  to assess whether an impairment indicator exists 
if we were to determine that an impairment indicator exists  we would be required to perform an impairment test which could result in a material impairment charge to our statement of operations 
accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to calculate and record in the statement of operations the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options or restricted stock  awarded to employees for services received 
the cost of the equity instrument is to be measured based on the fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
sfas no 
r is effective at the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june   or january  sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of the statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosure 
we adopted sfas no 
r as of january  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we historically accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we estimate this expense to be in the range of million to million in  dependent upon market price  assumptions used in estimating the fair value and the levels of share based payments granted in changes in market price and our assumptions could cause future expenses to vary significantly from our current estimates 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas no 
 which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the earliest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and restatement with respect to the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  although we will continue to evaluate the application of sfas no 
 management does not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
reclassifications we have reclassified certain prior year amounts within operating activities of the consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current year presentation 
this reclassification has no impact on our previously reported net loss or net cash used in operating activities in any period 
results of operations year ended december  annual percentage change in thousands  except per share revenues net product sales co promotion revenue revenue under strategic alliances royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense investment income  net interest expense gain on sale of equity interest in joint venture debt financing charge net loss amounts per common share net loss per share  basic and diluted weighted average shares  basic and diluted revenues total revenues increased to million in and three percent to million in increases in were primarily due to the net effect of the restructured sgp collaboration relationship and increased net product sales of velcade 
increases in were primarily driven by product related revenue  including net product sales of velcade and increased co promotion revenue 
net product sales of velcade increased to million in and to million in from million in the increase in was primarily due to growth in the second line treatment setting as a result of the march fda market approval of our snda filing 
the increase in over was due to net product sales for months in compared to only eight months in reserves for product returns  chargebacks and discounts represented approximately to of gross product sales in and product sales from velcade represented approximately of our total revenues  of our total revenues and of our total revenues 
co promotion revenue  based on sales of integrilin  decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in as of september   we are no longer reporting co promotion revenue due to our restructured relationship with sgp 
the increase was due to higher net reimbursement from sgp based upon our higher level of spending under our original collaboration agreement and increased product sales in the united states 
co promotion revenue represented approximately of our total revenues  of our total revenues and of our total revenues 
revenue under strategic alliances increased to million in and decreased to million in from million in the increase in was primarily due to the reimbursement of manufacturing related expenses  including the september  one time sale of the existing raw materials and finished goods integrilin inventory to sgp of approximately million 
the decrease in is primarily due to the april termination of the sanofi aventis technology transfer agreement and reduced revenue recognized under the research phase of our alliance with bayer  ag  partially offset by increased revenue under our ortho biotech alliance from milestone payments of approximately million earned in relating to velcade for injection approval in the european union and the achievement of specified sales levels of velcade 
included in strategic alliance revenue in is million that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we expect revenue under strategic alliances to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level of revenues earned for ongoing development efforts  the level of milestones achieved and the number of alliances we may enter into in the future with major pharmaceutical companies 
beginning september   in connection with the closing of our transaction with sgp  we now record royalty revenue 
royalty revenue may include royalties earned upon sales of integrilin in the united states and other territories around the world as provided by sgp  royalties earned upon sales of integrilin in europe as provided by gsk  distribution fees earned upon sales outside of the united states of velcade as provided by ortho biotech and any royalties earned under certain of our early discovery alliances 
during  we recorded million of royalty revenue which primarily included royalties from sgp and ortho biotech 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in and to million in cost of sales includes manufacturing related expenses associated with the sale of velcade and integrilin 
the increase was primarily attributable to the one time sale of existing integrilin inventory to sgp on september  the increase in was primarily driven by increased sales of velcade and integrilin 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in and to million in the decrease in was primarily a result of cost reductions associated with our strategy refinement and restructuring efforts combined with the decreased spending in our discovery organization 
research and development expenses in include outside research and development services primarily related to our further development of velcade  personnel and personnel related costs 
the decrease in primarily reflected the financial benefits of our june restructuring efforts  partially offset by increases in clinical trial costs for mln and integrilin 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease in due to our strategy refinement and restructuring efforts 
in addition to our ongoing clinical trials of velcade  we have a number of drug candidates in clinical and late preclinical development 
in january  as part of our portfolio review process  based on the evaluation of recent clinical data in the context of additional opportunities in the pipeline  we decided to discontinue development of mln in its current form as well as mln in rheumatoid arthritis 
the following chart summarizes the applicable disease indication and the clinical or preclinical trial status of these drug candidates 
product description disease indication current trial status cancer mln is a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase  or rtk  including flt  pdgf r and c kit acute myeloid leukemia glioma renal prostate phase i phase ii phase i planned for phase i planned for phase i planned for mln is a small molecule inhibitor of auroraa kinases advanced malignancies phase i inflammatory diseases mln is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha receptor crohn s disease ulcerative colitis preclinical with prior phase ii data preclinical with prior phase ii data mln is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against ccr multiple sclerosis secondary atherosclerosis scleroderma phase iia phase iia phase iia planned for mln is a small molecule ccr inhibitor chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis phase i with phase iia planned for mln is a small molecule ccr inhibitor  backup to mln chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis phase i mln is a small molecule inhibitor of ikkb inflammatory diseases phase i planned for completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the types of costs incurred during a clinical trial vary depending upon the type of product candidate and the nature of the study 
we estimate that clinical trials in our areas of focus are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase objective estimated completion period phase i establish safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs years phase ii evaluate efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety years phase iii confirm efficacy and safety of the product years upon successful completion of phase iii clinical trials of a product candidate  we intend to submit the results to the fda to support regulatory approval 
however  we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
our clinical trials might prove that our product candidates may not be effective in treating the disease or have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that require us to cease further development of the product candidate 
the cost to take a product candidate through clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the disease indications  the timing  the size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
we could incur increased product development costs if we experience delays in clinical trial enrollment  delays in the evaluation of clinical trial results or delays in regulatory approvals 
some products that are likely to result from our research and development projects are based on new technologies and new therapeutic approaches that have not been extensively tested in humans 
the regulatory requirements governing these types of products may be more rigorous than for conventional products 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the nature and length of the efforts to complete such products as we may experience a longer regulatory process in connection with any products that we develop based upon these new technologies or therapeutic approaches 
in addition  ultimate approval for commercial manufacturing and marketing of our products is dependent on the fda or applicable approval body in the country for which approval is being sought  adding further uncertainty to estimated costs and completion dates 
significant delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
significant categories of costs include personnel  clinical  third party research and development services and laboratory supplies 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development expenses is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not available 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
we do not expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our major research and development projects until a product candidate becomes a profitable commercial product 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased eight percent to million in and increased ten percent to million in the decrease in was primarily the result of reduced sales and marketing expenses associated with the transfer of the us commercialization rights to integrilin to sgp as of september  partially offset by increased sales and marketing spending associated with the launch of velcade for its additional indication 
the increase in was due to increased commercial spending to support velcade and integrilin  particularly the full year of increased headcount and activities by the velcade and expanded integrilin sales forces in partially offset by decreased expenses in corporate general and administrative functions attributable to our restructuring and cost containment efforts 
restructuring during the fourth quarter of  we announced our strategy refinement focused on advancing key growth assets  including velcade  our clinical and preclinical pipeline in oncology and inflammation molecules and our oncology focused discovery organization 
as part of our refined strategy  we have taken a series of steps  building on our restructured relationship with sgp  which together we expect will reduce research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in we have reduced the size of our company from  employees at the end of to approximately  at the end of  by managing attrition  eliminating integrilin sales and marketing positions  and reducing the number of positions in inflammation discovery and in business support groups 
in addition  we are evaluating the potential of further consolidating our cambridge  massachusetts based facilities 
in december and june  we took steps as part of our restructuring plan to focus our resources on drug development and commercialization 
our restructuring plan included consolidation of research and development facilities  overall headcount reduction and streamlining of discovery and development projects 
we account for restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet specified requirements 
costs of termination benefits relate to severance packages  out placement services and career counseling for employees affected by the restructuring 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our facilities related expenses and liabilities under both the and restructuring plans included estimates of the remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we no longer occupy 
we validated our estimates and assumptions with independent third parties having relevant expertise in the real estate market 
we review our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis until the outcome is finalized  and make whatever modifications we believe necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
it is possible that such estimates could change in the future resulting in additional adjustments  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
during  we recorded a total of million of restructuring charges under the strategy refinement and our restructuring plan 
we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million under the restructuring plan primarily related to the remaining rental obligation  net of sublease income  of vacated facilities  the impairment charges for leasehold improvements that were abandoned at such facilities and employee termination benefits for the employees affected by the transfer of the us commercialization rights to integrilin to sgp  as well as the headcount reductions within inflammation discovery and business support groups 
we expect to record additional restructuring charges of between and million in relating to our restructuring efforts 
we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives and as a result  future results could vary significantly from current expectations 
we recorded approximately million of restructuring charges in under our restructuring plan 
the majority of this charge represented million of additional facilities expense recorded in the third quarter of  primarily reflecting changes in our estimate of the length of time it would take to sublease certain vacated properties based upon our continuing review of current real estate market conditions 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets of million in was relatively unchanged from of million and decreased from to amortization decreased in as the specifically identified intangible assets from our leukosite  inc  or leukosite  acquisition were fully amortized as of december amortization in and primarily related to specifically identified intangible assets from the cor acquisition

we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december   the fair value of our notes  notes and notes approximates their carrying value
