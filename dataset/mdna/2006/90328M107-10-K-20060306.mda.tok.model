item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop and manufacture high quality nutritional and personal care products that are distributed through a network marketing system 
net sales are primarily dependent upon the efforts of a network of independent associates who purchase products and sales materials 
we also sell products directly to preferred customers who purchase products for personal use and are not permitted to resell or distribute the products 
as of december   we had approximately  active associates and approximately  active preferred customers worldwide 
for purposes of this report  we only count as active customers those associates and preferred customers who have purchased product from usana at any time during the most recent three month period 
as discussed more fully in note l of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have two reportable segments direct selling and contract manufacturing 
the direct selling segment constitutes our principal line of business developing  manufacturing  and distributing premium  science based nutritional and personal care products through a network marketing system 
the contract manufacturing segment exists primarily to manufacture and package the company s sens product line of skin and personal care products  but also includes contract manufacturing services provided to a limited number of third party customers 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and title passes to our customers 
in  sales in the nine markets within our direct selling segment contributed to consolidated net sales as follows north america united states canada mexico north america total pacific rim australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea singapore pacific rim total segment total sales from the contract manufacturing segment accounted for the remaining of consolidated net sales in as we expand our business into additional international markets  we expect international operations to account for an increasing percentage of net sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials  labor  quality assurance  and overhead costs that are directly associated with the production and distribution of products and sales materials  as well as duties and taxes associated with product exports 
as international sales increase as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales could increase slightly  reflecting additional duties  freight  and other expenses associated with international growth 
associate incentive expenses are incurred only by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant expense for this segment at of net segment sales in associate incentives include commissions and leadership bonuses that are paid weekly  based on sales volume points 
certain promotions and contests are also reported as associate incentives 
products are assigned a sales volume point value that is independent of the product s price 
associates earn commissions based on sales volume points generated in their downline sales organization 
starter kits and sales tools have no sales volume point value  and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  rents and utilities  associate events  promotion and advertising  and professional fees along with other marketing and administrative expenses 
wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
significant depreciation and amortization expense is incurred as a result of continued investments in computer and telecommunications equipment and systems to support international expansion 
we anticipate that significant additional capital investments will be required in future periods to promote and support anticipated growth in sales and the increasing size of our customer base 
research and development expenses include costs incurred in developing new products  enhancing existing products  and formulating products for introduction into international markets

the decrease in net sales of our contract manufacturing segment can be attributed to an increased focus on the manufacture of our sens line and a decreased emphasis on our third party business 
the company follows the practice of providing guidance concerning anticipated net sales 
management currently anticipates annual net sales to grow between and for fiscal year we expect our sales increase will come from our direct selling segment

consolidated gross profit increased to of net sales in from in this improvement in consolidated gross profit can primarily be attributed to a decrease in the impact that the contract manufacturing segment had on the total  and to a lesser extent  modest leverage benefits gained on a rising sales base 
gross profit in the direct selling segment increased modestly in to of net segment sales  compared to in this modest improvement can primarily be attributed to leverage benefits on semi variable costs realized on a rising sales base 
the contract manufacturing segment generated no gross profit from its third party customers for the year  compared to gross profit of in the decline in gross profit margin from third party customers can primarily be attributed to production inefficiencies in the segment s third party business 
the contract manufacturing business was acquired primarily as a means to produce the company s sens product line  not for the third party business 
we anticipate improvement to the gross profit margins in each of our business segments throughout due to lower expected costs on certain raw materials and improved production efficiency 
associate incentives 
expenses related to associate incentives are only incurred by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant cost as a percentage of net sales for this segment 
associate incentives increased to of net segment sales in  compared to in the increase in associate incentives relative to net segment sales can be attributed to a higher payout rate of base commissions generated  as well as an increase in promotions during in the third quarter of we began an initiative to increase rewards to our top performing associates through contests  promotions  and other incentives designed to assist them in growing their respective businesses 
we anticipate that this initiative will result in associate incentives increasing to approximately of net sales in our direct selling segment in selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease  as a percentage of net sales  can be attributed to leverage gained on the increase in sales during in absolute terms  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from to  which was attributable to an increase in spending in many of our markets to support growing sales and an increasing number of associates 
we believe that for the first time in several years  selling  general  and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of net sales in when compared to a portion of the selling  general  and administrative expenses to support our growing sales and associate base operate in a step function such that incremental costs are expected to be incurred at a rate faster than the top line is anticipated to grow 
additionally  we will begin expensing equity compensation during of which the vast majority will be included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
income taxes 
income taxes totaled of earnings before income taxes in  compared with in the increase in the effective tax rate for can be attributed to the first phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion  which was only partially offset by a new deduction for qualified production activities 
additionally  in we received a favorable settlement from a foreign tax audit that was not repeated in we expect the effective tax rate for will be approximately due to an additional phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion benefit to a total phase out  with no increases in the current deduction of qualified production activities income 
net earnings 
net earnings increased to million in  an increase of million  from million in the increase in net earnings can be primarily attributed to increased net sales and improved operating margins 
diluted earnings per share improved to in  an increase of  from in we expect earnings per share for fiscal year to grow between and  excluding the expensing of equity compensation required under sfas no

we commenced operations in mexico in march  which contributed million to net sales for total sales reported in included one additional week worth of sales totaling approximately million fiscal year was a week year and fiscal year was a week year 
the increase in net sales contributed by the contract manufacturing segment can be primarily attributed to the following factors a full year of operations for the segment that commenced in july  a significant increase in sales to the segment s primary customer during  and new contracts added during the following tables summarize the growth in active customers for the direct selling segment by geographic region as of the dates indicated active associates by region rounded to the nearest thousand as of as of change from percent region january  january  prior year change north america united states canada mexico n a north america total pacific rim australia new zealand hong kong japan taiwan south korea singapore pacific rim total total we believe that various factors contributed to the increase in the active associate base  including new market openings  on going communication with associate leaders in the field  improved infrastructure to enhance the associate service level  and company sponsored events and promotions to motivate associates

consolidated gross profit decreased to of net sales in from in the direct selling segment s gross profit remained relatively constant at of net segment sales in  compared to in gross profit in our contract manufacturing segment decreased to of net segment sales from in during  we continued to encounter higher purchase prices for one of our raw materials  coenzyme q coq  due to a persistent shortage in supply 
additionally  we increased our provision for inventory valuation to account for obsolescence of our old sens inventory 
these factors that contributed to a lower gross profit margin were partially offset by improved production efficiencies achieved in the relatively lower gross profit margin in our contract manufacturing segment during was primarily a result of two factors construction upgrades to our manufacturing facility in draper  utah during the first quarter of and higher than anticipated demand  resulting in additional production and distribution costs  such as expediting freight 
associate incentives 
expenses related to associate incentives are incurred only by the direct selling segment and represent the most significant cost as a percent of net sales for the segment 
associate incentives remained relatively constant at of net segment sales in compared to in selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease as a percentage of net sales can be primarily attributed to leverage gained on the increase in net sales during while selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from to  in absolute terms  these expenses increased million or in  virtually all of which can be attributed to the direct selling segment 
the absolute increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses contributed by the direct selling segment can be primarily attributed to the following factors an increase in spending in many of our markets to support a growing associate base and related sales  increased spending in our newest markets of south korea  singapore  and mexico  totaling approximately million due to a full year of operations  and higher translated us dollar of foreign currency expenses  totaling million  as a result of a weaker us dollar

because our products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we are highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality  and efficacy of our products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more products or other products similar to our products could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  quarterly revenues  expenses  and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues in future periods or be able to sustain the level of revenue or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis that we have sustained in the past 
due to the foregoing factors  future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if that occurred  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources we continue to finance our growth with cash flows from operations 
in  net cash flows from operating activities totaled million  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december   from million at january  additionally  net working capital decreased to million at december   compared to million at january  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and net working capital during is due to million used to purchase shares under the company s share repurchase plan 
during the fiscal year ended december   directors  officers  and employees exercised stock options  resulting in cash proceeds and tax benefits to the company of million and million  respectively 
the company has continued to grow significantly over the last several years and is in need of additional administrative and warehouse space  as well as additional parking space 
to address this need  the company will be expanding its corporate headquarters and anticipates the facility expansion will require an investment of approximately nine million dollars during as of december   our credit facilities consisted of a million line of credit  with no amounts outstanding 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with one of the covenants relating to tangible net worth 
the company has since amended the agreement with its bank  and the tangible net worth covenant has been removed from the credit agreement 
we believe that current cash balances  cash provided by operations  and amounts available under the line of credit are sufficient to cover our capital needs in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future 
if we experience an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms 
we might also require or seek additional financing for the purpose of expanding new markets  growing our existing markets  and for other reasons 
such financing may include the sale of additional equity securities 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments convertible into equity securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to existing shareholders 
contractual obligations and commercial contingencies the following table summarizes our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital commitments other commitments total contractual obligations obligations for operating leases in the above table contain the assumption that  in the normal course of business  any operating leases that expire within the time frame represented will be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties  assuming operations continue and will extend  at a maximum  through included in capital commitments in the above table is a planned addition to our corporate headquarters building of office space for executive and administrative personnel  warehouse space  and additional parking space for our employees 
we expect this construction to be complete by the end of  at an estimated total cost of approximately million 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
those estimates and assumptions are derived and continually evaluated based on historical experiences  current facts and circumstances  and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may sometimes differ materially from estimates under different conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as both those that are material to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and as those that require management s most subjective judgments 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as described in this section 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition  revenue is recognized at the point of shipment of the merchandise  at which point the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
sab specifies that revenue is realizable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
for our direct selling segment  we require cash or credit card payment prior to shipping and do not extend credit to customers 
under the guidelines of emerging issues task force no eitf accounting of shipping and handling fees and costs  amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as revenue 
payments received for unshipped products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities 
a reserve for product returns and allowances is provided for and is founded on historical experience 
additionally  we collect an annual renewal fee from our associates that is deferred when collected and recognized as income on a straight line basis over a subsequent twelve month period 
allowance for inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor  and overhead 
an allowance for inventory valuation is maintained and is based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
to estimate the allowance  various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning  and market conditions 
a change in any of these variables could result in additional reserves 
a history of the allowance for inventory valuation for each of the last three fiscal years is provided in note c of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
valuation of goodwill and impairment analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair market value of identifiable net assets of companies acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  however  it is tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
we engage an independent third party to conduct the annual impairment test of goodwill 
we determine the fair market value of reporting units acquired using widely accepted valuation methods  including both a market approach and an income approach 
the market approach involves judgment when considering the appropriateness of comparable entities and use of related multiples to determine fair market value  in terms of operating activities  size  and scope 
the income approach requires the use of estimates and assumptions in projecting future operating results and related cash flows 
based on the valuation conducted as part of the impairment test  if a significant downward revision were made in estimates and assumptions that resulted in a fair market value for the reporting unit that was less than its carrying value  an impairment loss for goodwill would be necessary to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity 
there were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by acquired subsidiary for the year ended december  as shown in note f of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to expand our foreign operations 
net sales  earnings from operations  and net earnings are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates  and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political  and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
foreign currency risks 
sales outside the united states represented   and of net sales in   and  respectively 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency is considered the functional currency of each international subsidiary  with all revenue and expenses being translated at weighted average exchange rates for reported periods 
in general  our reported sales and earnings are affected positively by a weakening us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies for the countries in which our products are sold 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
we seek to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our strategy in this regard includes entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage currency fluctuations of expected net cash flow from certain of our international markets  which are primarily represented by intercompany cash transfers 
during the fiscal year ended december   we entered into option contracts to offset our exposure to the canadian dollar  australian dollar  new zealand dollar  new taiwan dollar  and mexican peso 
for additional disclosure regarding outstanding foreign currency forwards and options  see note j of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
there can be no assurance that our practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks encountered in connection with our foreign currency transactions 
following are the average exchange rates of foreign currency units to one us dollar for each of our foreign markets for the years ended   and year ended canadian dollar australian dollar new zealand dollar hong kong dollar japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won singapore dollar mexican peso chinese yuan the korean won exchange rate represents the average for the first six months of south korea operations that commenced in july the singapore dollar exchange rate represents the average for the first two months of singapore operations that commenced in november the mexican peso exchange rate represents the average for the first ten months of mexican operations that commenced in march the chinese yuan exchange rate represents the average for the first three months of operations of our chinese manufacturing facility acquired in october market was not in operation during year indicated 
interest rate risks 
as of december   we had no outstanding debt  and  therefore  we currently have no direct exposure to interest rate risk
