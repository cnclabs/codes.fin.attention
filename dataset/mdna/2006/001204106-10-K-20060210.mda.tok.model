overview we are a fortune energy services holding company whose principal business is the distribution of natural gas in six states florida  georgia  maryland  new jersey  tennessee and virginia 
our six utilities serve more than million end use customers  making us the largest distributor of natural gas in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states based on customer count 
we also are involved in various related businesses  including retail natural gas marketing to end use customers primarily in georgia  natural gas asset management and related logistics activities for our own utilities as well as for other nonaffiliated companies  natural gas storage arbitrage and related activities  operation of high deliverability underground natural gas storage assets  and construction and operation of telecommunications conduit and fiber infrastructure within selected metropolitan areas 
we manage these businesses through four operating segments distribution operations  retail energy operations  wholesale services and energy investments and a nonoperating corporate segment 
the distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is regulated by regulatory agencies in six states 
these agencies approve rates designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs such as depreciation  interest  maintenance and overhead costs  and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders 
with the exception of atlanta gas light company atlanta gas light  our largest utility  the earnings of our regulated utilities are weather sensitive to varying degrees 
although various regulatory mechanisms provide us a reasonable opportunity to recover our fixed costs regardless of natural gas volumes sold  the effect of weather manifests itself in terms of higher earnings during periods of colder weather and lower earnings in warmer weather 
atlanta gas light charges rates to its customers primarily on monthly fixed charges 
our retail energy operations segment  which consists of southstar energy services llc southstar  also is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies to mitigate potential weather impacts 
our sequent energy management  lp sequent subsidiary within our wholesale services segment is weather sensitive  with typically increased earnings opportunities during periods of extreme weather conditions 

table of contents during the year ended december   we derived approximately of our earnings before interest and taxes ebit from our regulated natural gas distribution business and the sale of natural gas to end use customers primarily in georgia through southstar 
this statistic is significant because it represents the portion of our earnings that directly results from the underlying business of supplying natural gas to retail customers 
although southstar is not subject to the same regulatory framework as our utilities  it is an integral part of the retail framework for providing gas service to end use customers in the state of georgia 
for more information regarding our measurement of ebit  see results of operations agl resources 
the remaining of our ebit was principally derived from businesses that are complementary to our natural gas distribution business 
we engage in natural gas asset management and the operation of high deliverability natural gas underground storage as ancillary activities to our utility franchises 
these businesses allow us to be opportunistic in capturing incremental value at the wholesale level  provide us with deepened business insight about natural gas market dynamics and facilitate our ability  in the case of asset management  to provide transparency to regulators as to how that value can be captured to benefit our utility customers through profit sharing arrangements 
given the volatile and changing nature of the natural gas resource base in north america and globally  we believe that participation in these related businesses strengthens our business 
our competitive strengths we believe our competitive strengths have enabled us to grow our business profitably and create significant shareholder value 
these strengths include regulated distribution assets located in growing geographic regions our operations are primarily concentrated along the east coast of the united states  from florida to new jersey 
we operate primarily urban utility franchises in growing metropolitan areas where we can more effectively deploy technology to improve service delivery and manage costs 
we believe the population growth and resulting expansion in business and construction activity in many of the areas we serve should result in increased demand for natural gas and related infrastructure for the foreseeable future 
demonstrated track record of performance through superior execution we continue to focus our efforts on generating significant incremental earnings improvements from each of our businesses 
we have been successful in achieving this goal in the past through a combination of business growth  opportunistic acquisitions and controlling or reducing our operating expenses 
we achieved these improvements to our operations in part through the implementation of best practices in our businesses  including increased investments in enterprise technology  workforce automation and business process modernization 
our goal is a single operational platform that eliminates duplicate systems and disparate processes among our various companies 
demonstrated ability to acquire and integrate natural gas assets that add significant incremental earnings we take a disciplined approach to identifying strategic natural gas assets that support our long term business plan 
for example  our acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in new jersey  florida and maryland provided us an opportunity to leverage and strengthen one of our core competencies the efficient  low cost operation of natural gas franchises 
the disparity between these utilities pre acquisition utility operating metrics and cost structure and those of our other utilities provided us an opportunity to achieve significant improvements in these businesses  which we have been able to do 
we will continue to seek and implement better methods of operating in order to improve our service delivery and reduce our costs 
in addition  our acquisition of a natural gas storage facility in louisiana in added immediate incremental earnings to our business and  given the possibilities for expansion  has the potential to provide prospective earnings growth 
business accomplishments in we believe the results of our efforts are clear 
we not only delivered solid results to our shareholders again in but also provided customers with improved service 

table of contents in  we increased net income over the prior year to million and increased fully diluted earnings per share to despite increased average outstanding debt of million and million additional shares outstanding in due to our public stock offering in november  both of which were related to acquisitions in the fourth quarter of our board of directors raised our annual dividend in november  to an annual rate of per share 
the increase marked the fourth time in three years our board has raised the dividend  bringing our payout ratio more in line with other publicly traded energy holding companies and local distribution companies and ensuring a competitive dividend yield relative to alternative investments 
we have substantially completed the integration of our two recent acquisitions nui corporation nui  which we acquired on november   and jefferson island storage hub  llc jefferson island  which we acquired on october  jefferson island became a wholly owned subsidiary and was renamed pivotal jefferson island storage hub  llc pivotal jefferson island 
in  we consolidated a number of nui s business technology platforms into our enterprise wide systems  including the accounting  payroll  human resources and supply chain functions 
we also consolidated the former nui utility call center operations into our own centralized call center 
the combination of systems integration and the application of our operational model to managing nui has resulted in significant improvements in its operations  as measured by the various metrics we use to manage our business 
as a result of these integration efforts  we believe that we have achieved our performance goal of successfully integrating these acquisitions and making them accretive to our consolidated earnings within one year of the acquisition closing date 
we continued business process improvement actions  including the deployment of substantial technology resources  in each of our business units 
additionally  through asset management  producer services and storage arbitrage activities at sequent  we captured and recognized incremental net income from opportunities in the marketplace as we provided services during and after hurricanes katrina and rita 
our operational platform was tested when  during hurricane rita  sequent relocated its trading floor from houston to richardson  texas with virtually no service interruptions  in order to keep our commitments to customers and provide continuity in a market where service disruptions were prevalent 
lastly  we worked cooperatively with our regulators during the year 
in georgia  we negotiated a settlement in the atlanta gas light rate case whereby rates billed to customers will not change for a five year period but atlanta gas light will recognize reduced operating revenues of million per year for a total of million over the five year period 
goals our fundamental business goals do not significantly change from one year to the next 
however  we continue to refine our goals  taking into consideration our prior financial and operational performance and those external factors impacting not only us and the natural gas industry  but also the global marketplace 
we are focused on delivering earnings and income growth by effectively managing our gas distribution operations  selectively growing our gas distribution businesses through acquisitions  and developing our portfolio of closely related unregulated businesses 
impact of hurricanes on agl resources and our industry the natural gas production  processing and pipeline infrastructure in the gulf of mexico was significantly affected by hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september this resulted in higher prices and increased price volatility for natural gas  which we and the energy information administration expected would significantly increase the cost to heat a home during the current heating season 
natural gas prices moderated by the end of and early  and weather has been warmer than normal thus far in  but we still expect home heating costs to be significantly higher in the first quarter of compared to prior years 
the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on natural gas prices and transportation costs created diverse offsetting effects on our business 
increased energy and transportation prices are expected to consume a significantly larger portion of consumer household incomes during the remaining winter heating season first quarter of  raising the possibility that we will experience some additional bad debt expense  as well as some margin erosion from increased consumer conservation 
these higher prices have thus far been mitigated in part by significantly warmer than normal temperatures in the eastern united states during the first half of the heating season 
while we expect these factors to have some impact on our financial results  primarily in the first half of  we expect the regulatory and operational mechanisms in place in most of our jurisdictions will help mitigate our exposures to high natural gas prices 
natural gas price volatility during made it further evident that we and our customers need to diversify our sources of natural gas supply 
we receive the majority of our natural gas supplies from a production region in and around the gulf of mexico and generally  demand for this natural gas is growing faster than supply 
this increased demand can often lead to higher natural gas prices and greater price volatility 
we believe a diversification of our supply portfolio  in an effort to moderate prices  is in our customers best interest 
we may need  from time to time  to invest in new projects to improve the viability of such portfolio diversification and would expect to earn regulated returns on such investments 

table of contents the market dynamics brought on by the two hurricanes presented opportunities for sequent  and for our utilities through sequent s affiliate asset management agreements 
sequent drew on its knowledge of the natural gas grid to move gas from supply sources and deliver it to its customers  which involved moving gas over less traditional routes due to gulf coast infrastructure limitations 
for additional information regarding the impacts of these hurricanes on our business  see results of operations distribution operations and results of operations wholesale services 
regulatory environment we continue to manage the ongoing challenge of operating in a regulatory environment that generally does not measure or reward innovation and operational efficiency 
in particular  traditional cost of service regulation  which was originally designed to simulate the actions of a competitive market  has not kept pace with the vast changes taking place in the natural gas industry  in technology utilization and in the global economy 
these are factors that to various degrees affect our company 
the staffs of various state rate setting agencies have argued for significantly lower rates of return on regulated investments without adequate attention to the effects those lower returns might have on capital reinvestment in the company s regulated asset base  the opportunity cost to customers of not providing better and more efficient services  and the disincentive for excellence in management and operations that such returns create 
much of the rate setting is done in adversarial proceedings where rules of evidence and due process can vary greatly among the states 
as a result of these ongoing regulatory challenges  we will continue to work cooperatively with our regulators  legislators and others as we seek  through rate freezes and performance based rates  to create a framework in each jurisdiction that is conducive to our business goals 
furthermore  we will continue to make strategic investments in energy related businesses that either are not subject to traditional state and federal rate regulation or are subject to limited oversight in order to add value for our shareholders 
in august  the energy policy act of energy act was enacted 
the energy act authorized many broad energy policy provisions including significant funding for consumers and businesses for energy related activities  energy related tax credits  accelerated depreciation for certain natural gas utility infrastructure investments and the repeal of the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca 
the effective date of the puhca repeal is february  we continue to evaluate the energy act  but we expect to benefit from provisions in the legislation that will support our efforts to promote energy efficiency in a manner that benefits customers and shareholders 
the energy act gives the federal energy regulatory commission ferc increased authority over utility merger and acquisition activity  removes many of the geographic and structural restrictions on the ownership of public utilities and eliminates certain regulatory burdens 
some of the sec reporting requirements  financing authorizations and affiliate relationship approvals that previously applied to us under the puhca were replaced by the requirements of the energy act 
in addition  the energy act requires a public utility holding company to maintain its books and records and make them available to the ferc and to comply with certain reporting requirements 
however  the ferc may exempt a class of entities or class of transactions if the ferc finds that they are not relevant to the jurisdictional rate of a public utility or natural gas company 
in february  we requested an exemption from energy act oversight of our local distribution companies that were previously exempt from regulation by the ferc 
our filing request will provide us with a temporary exemption 
if the ferc has not taken action within days of our request  the exemption shall be deemed to have been granted 
we expect to qualify for an exemption from these reporting requirements 
for more information regarding pending federal and state regulatory matters  see results of operations distribution operations and results of operations wholesale services 

table of contents results of operations agl resources our results of operations for included three months of the acquired operations of jefferson island and one month of the acquired operations of nui 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin as revised  which we adopted in january  we consolidated southstar s accounts with our subsidiaries accounts as of january  for the years ended december  and  we recorded the piedmont natural gas company  inc piedmont portion of southstar s earnings as a minority interest in our statements of consolidated income and the piedmont portion of southstar s contributed capital as a minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
we eliminated any intercompany profits between segments 
in  we accounted for our noncontrolling financial ownership interest in southstar using the equity method of accounting because southstar did not meet the definition of a variable interest entity under fin under the equity method  we reported our ownership interest in southstar as an investment in our consolidated balance sheets  and we reported our share of southstar s earnings based on our ownership percentage in our statements of consolidated income as a component of other income 
seasonality the operating revenues and ebit of our distribution operations  retail energy operations and wholesale services segments are seasonal 
during the heating season october march  natural gas usage and operating revenues are higher because generally more customers are connected to our distribution systems and because natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather than in periods of warmer weather 
approximately of these segments operating revenues and ebit for the year ended december  were generated during the six month heating season and are reflected in our consolidated income statements for the quarters ended march  and december  our base operating expenses  excluding cost of gas  interest expense and certain incentive compensation costs  are incurred relatively equally over any given year 
thus our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality 
seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items such as receivables  unbilled revenue  inventories and short term debt across quarters 
hedging changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of our operations to variability 
commodity prices tend to be higher in colder months 
our nonutility businesses principally use physical and financial arrangements to economically hedge the risks associated with both seasonal fluctuations and changing commodity prices 
in addition  because these economic hedges are generally not designated for hedge accounting treatment  our reported earnings for the wholesale services and retail energy operations segments reflect changes in the fair values of certain derivatives  these values may change significantly from period to period 
elizabethtown gas utilizes certain derivatives to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these derivative products are marked to market each reporting period 
in accordance with regulatory requirements  realized gains and losses related to these derivatives are reflected in purchased gas costs and ultimately included in billings to customers 
unrealized gains and losses are reflected as a regulatory asset loss or liability gain  as appropriate  in our consolidated balance sheets 
revenues we generate nearly all our operating revenues through the sale  distribution and storage of natural gas 
we include in our consolidated revenues an estimate of revenues from natural gas distributed  but not yet billed  to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the reporting period 
we record these estimated revenues as unbilled revenues in our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents operating margin and ebit we evaluate the performance of our operating segments using the measures of operating margin and ebit 
we believe operating margin is a better indicator than revenues for the contribution resulting from customer growth in our distribution operations segment since the cost of gas can vary significantly and is generally passed directly to our customers 
we also consider operating margin to be a better indicator in our retail energy operations  wholesale services and energy investments segments since it is a direct measure of gross profit before overhead costs 
we believe ebit is a useful measurement of our operating segments performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective  exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes  neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations 
our operating margin and ebit are not measures that are considered to be calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
you should not consider operating margin or ebit an alternative to  or a more meaningful indicator of  our operating performance than operating income or net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our operating margin or ebit measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of our operating margin and ebit to our operating income and net income  together with other consolidated financial information for the years ended december  and  and pro forma results as if southstar s accounts were consolidated with our subsidiaries accounts for the year ended december  the unaudited pro forma results are presented for comparative purposes as a result of our consolidation of southstar s accounts with our subsidiaries accounts as of january  this pro forma basis is a non gaap presentation  however  we believe it is useful to readers of our financial statements since it presents our revenues and expenses for on the same basis as and in millions pro forma operating revenues cost of gas operating margin operating expenses operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income total operating expenses gain on sale of caroline street campus operating income other losses minority interest ebit interest expense earnings before income taxes income taxes income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income basic earnings per common share income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle basic earnings per common share fully diluted earnings per common share income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle fully diluted earnings per common share weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic diluted

atlanta gas light s operating margin increased as a result of higher pipeline replacement revenues  additional carrying costs charged to retail marketers in georgia for gas storage  customer growth and higher customer usage 
virginia natural gas operating margin increased primarily due to customer growth 

table of contents operating expenses increased million on a pro forma basis or primarily as a result of million in higher expenses due to the additions of nui and jefferson island 
in addition  operating expenses at wholesale services increased million due to increased outside service costs related to its energy trading and risk management system and sox compliance projects and an increase in the number of employees  as well as increased depreciation

a rate base of equity for elizabethtown gas was authorized in most recent rate case  however  is used for rate of return calculation purposes based on estimated current regulatory capital structure 
each utility operates subject to regulations provided by the state regulatory agency in its service territories with respect to rates charged to our customers  maintenance of accounting records  and various other service and safety matters 
rates charged to our customers vary according to customer class residential  commercial or industrial and rate jurisdiction 
rates are set at levels that allow recovery of all prudently incurred costs  including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable return on common equity 
rate base consists generally of the original cost of utility plant in service  working capital  inventories and certain other assets  less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service  net deferred income tax liabilities and certain other deductions 
our utilities are authorized to use a purchased gas adjustment pga mechanism that allows them to automatically adjust their rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and to ensure the utilities recover of the costs incurred in purchasing gas for their customers 
we continuously monitor the performance of our utilities to determine whether rates need to be further adjusted by making a rate case filing 
increased natural gas prices  bad debt and conservation increased prices of natural gas are being driven by increased demand that is exceeding the growth in available supply 
the hurricanes in the gulf coast region during the late summer and early fall of impacted the availability of natural gas supply  causing a dramatic rise in natural gas prices 
these higher prices have thus far been mitigated in part by significantly warmer than normal temperatures in the eastern united states during the first half of the heating season 
we expect our customers will incur increases in their bills during the remainder of the current winter heating season 
an increase in the cost of gas due to higher natural gas commodity costs generally has no direct effect on our utility s net operating margins and net income due to the pga mechanisms at our utilities 
however  net income may be reduced as a result of higher expenses that may be incurred for bad debt  as well as lower volumes of natural gas deliveries to customers due to customer conservation and thus lower natural gas consumption 

table of contents these risks of increased bad debt expense and decreased operating margins from conservation are minimized at our largest utility  atlanta gas light  as a result of its straight fixed variable rate structure and because customers in georgia buy gas from certificated marketers rather than from atlanta gas light 
our credit exposure at atlanta gas light is primarily related to the provision of services for the certificated marketers  but that exposure is mitigated because we obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a marketer s highest month s estimated bill 
as part of our integration strategy  we have implemented measures at our new jersey and florida utilities to collect delinquent accounts  these measures are similar to our processes at virginia natural gas and chattanooga gas 
across our utility system  bad debt levels are lower year to date than they have been in previous years  and we will continue to monitor and mitigate the impact of uncollectible expenses 
we are partnering with regulators and state agencies in each of our jurisdictions to educate customers about these issues  and particularly to ensure that those who qualify for low income home energy assistance funds and similar programs receive that assistance 
competition our distribution operations businesses face competition based on customer preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
our principal competition relates to electric utilities and oil and propane providers serving the residential and small commercial markets throughout our service areas and the potential displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances 
the primary competitive factors are the price of energy and the desirability of natural gas heating versus alternative heating sources 
competition for space heating and general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install 
customers generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment 
customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors  including changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy general economic conditions energy conservation legislation and regulations the capability to convert from natural gas to alternative fuels weather in some of our service areas net growth continues to be slowed due to the number of customers who leave our systems because of higher natural gas prices and competition from alternative fuel sources  including incentives offered by the local electric utilities to switch to electric heat alternatives 
we expect customer growth to improve in the future through our efforts in new business and retention 
these efforts include working to add residential customers with three or more appliances  multifamily complexes and high value commercial customers that use natural gas for purposes other than space heating 
in addition  we partner with numerous entities to market the benefits of gas appliances and to identify potential retention options early in the process for those customers who might consider leaving our franchise by converting to alternative fuels 
atlanta gas light this natural gas local distribution utility operates distribution systems and related facilities throughout georgia 
atlanta gas light is regulated by the georgia public service commission georgia commission 
prior to georgia s natural gas competition and deregulation act deregulation act  which deregulated georgia s natural gas market  atlanta gas light was the supplier and seller of natural gas to its customers 
today  marketers that is  marketers who are certificated by the georgia commission to sell retail natural gas in georgia at rates and on terms approved by the georgia commission sell natural gas to end use customers in georgia and handle customer billing functions 
atlanta gas light s role includes distributing natural gas for marketers constructing  operating and maintaining the gas system infrastructure  including responding to customer service calls and leaks reading meters and maintaining underlying customer premise information for marketers since  a number of federal and state proceedings have addressed the role of atlanta gas light in administering and assigning interstate assets to marketers pursuant to the provisions of the deregulation act 
in this role  atlanta gas light is authorized to offer additional sales services pursuant to georgia commission approved tariffs and to acquire and continue managing the interstate transportation and storage contracts that underlie the sales services provided to marketers on its distribution system under georgia commission approved tariffs 

table of contents rate settlement agreement in june  the georgia commission approved a settlement agreement with atlanta gas light that froze atlanta gas light s base rates billed to customers as of april  through april  the settlement agreement also requires atlanta gas light to recognize reduced revenues of million over the same period  to spend million annually on energy conservation programs and to spend an additional million for social responsibility and education programs 
the settlement agreement was effective for rates as of may  atlanta gas light offset the impact of the settlement agreement on its ebit by identifying and implementing reductions in its operating costs and by realizing increased operating margins from net customer growth in during the term of the settlement agreement  atlanta gas light will not seek a rate increase  nor will the georgia commission initiate a new rate proceeding 
atlanta gas light will file information equivalent to information that would be required for a general rate case on november   with new rates to be effective on may  the settlement agreement establishes an authorized return on equity of for atlanta gas light  resulting in an overall rate of return of 
prior to the settlement  atlanta gas light s authorized return on equity was and its overall return was set at 
the settlement agreement extends atlanta gas light s pipeline replacement program prp by five years to require that all replacements be completed by december and sets the per customer prp rate to be billed at per customer per month from may through september and at from october through december atlanta gas light will apply the five year total reduction in recognized base rate revenues of million to the amount of costs incurred to replace pipe  reducing the amount recovered from customers under the prp 
the timing of replacements was subsequently specified in an amendment to the prp stipulation 
this amendment  which was approved by the georgia commission on december   requires atlanta gas light to replace the remaining miles of cast iron pipe and of the remaining miles of bare steel pipe by december the remaining of bare steel pipe is required to be replaced by december the amendment requires an evaluation by atlanta gas light and the georgia commission staff of miles of inch pipe in atlanta by december to determine if such pipe requires replacement 
if replacement of this pipe is required  the pipe must be replaced by december the additional cost to replace this pipe is projected to be approximately million 
the settlement agreement includes a provision that allows for a true up of any over or under recovery of prp revenues that may result from a difference between prp charges collected through fixed rates and actual prp revenues recognized through the remainder of the program 
atlanta gas light will be allowed under the settlement agreement to recover through the prp million of the million in capital costs associated with its march purchase of miles of pipeline in central georgia from southern natural gas company sng  a subsidiary of el paso corporation 
we expect the acquired pipeline to improve deliverable capacity and reliability of the storage capacity from our lng facility in macon to our markets in atlanta 
the remaining capital costs are included in atlanta gas light s rate base and collected through base rates 
straight fixed variable rates atlanta gas light s revenue is recognized under a straight fixed variable rate design whereby atlanta gas light charges rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges 
this mechanism minimizes the seasonality of revenues since the fixed charge is not volumetric and the monthly charges are not set to be directly weather dependent 
weather indirectly influences the number of customers that have active accounts during the heating season  and this has a seasonal impact on atlanta gas light s revenues since generally more customers are connected in periods of colder weather than in periods of warmer weather 
elizabethtown gas this natural gas local distribution utility operates distribution systems and related facilities in central and northwestern new jersey 
most elizabethtown gas customers are located in densely populated central new jersey  where increases in the number of customers primarily result from conversions to gas heating from alternative forms of heating 
in the northwestern region of the state  customer additions are driven primarily by new construction 
elizabethtown gas is regulated by the new jersey board of public utilities njbpu 
weather normalization the elizabethtown gas tariff contains a weather normalization clause that is designed to help stabilize elizabethtown gas results by increasing base rate amounts charged to customers when weather is warmer than normal and decreasing amounts charged when weather is colder than normal 
the weather normalization clause was renewed in october and is based on a year average of weather conditions 

table of contents pipeline replacement in april  elizabethtown gas presented the njbpu with a proposal to accelerate the replacement of approximately miles of to diameter elevated pressure cast iron pipe 
under the proposal  approximately million in estimated capital costs incurred over a three year period would be recovered through a pipeline replacement rider similar to the program in effect at atlanta gas light 
if the program as proposed is approved  cost recovery would occur on a one year lag basis  with collections starting on october  and extending through december   after which time the program would be rolled into base rates 
on december   elizabethtown gas filed testimony in support of its proposal 
the proposal and related testimony will be considered in the following timeframe the new jersey rate payer advocate will file testimony on february  elizabethtown gas will file rebuttal testimony on march  public hearings will convene on march  virginia natural gas this natural gas local distribution utility operates distribution systems and related facilities in southeastern virginia 
virginia natural gas is regulated by the virginia state corporation commission virginia commission 
performance based rates in march  the virginia commission staff issued a report alleging that virginia natural gas rates were excessive and that its rates should be adjusted to produce a million reduction in revenue 
the staff also filed a motion requesting that virginia natural gas rates be declared interim and subject to refund 
in april  virginia natural gas responded to the staff s report and motion  contesting the allegations in the report and objecting to the motion filed by the staff 
on april   the virginia commission ordered the staff s motion to be held in abeyance and directed virginia natural gas to file a rate case by july in july  virginia natural gas filed a performance based rate pbr plan with the virginia commission and included the schedules required for a general rate case in support of its proposal 
under the pbr plan  virginia natural gas proposes to freeze base rates at their levels for additional years 
this would provide virginia natural gas customers an additional years of rate stability  for a total of years without a rate increase 
if the virginia commission approves the proposal  virginia natural gas will become the first virginia natural gas utility to operate under a state law that authorized pbr plans for natural gas utilities 
consistent with state law  virginia natural gas has proposed two exceptions that allow for adjustments to frozen base rates 
virginia natural gas could request a rate adjustment in connection with any changes in taxation of gas utility revenues by the commonwealth and any financial distress of virginia natural gas beyond its control 
based on the virginia commission s scheduling order issued on july   current rates will stay in effect until the pbr is decided  consequently  there was no impact on virginia natural gas revenues 
based on this scheduling order and the virginia commission s approval of requests for extension made by the virginia commission staff in december  the pbr proposal to freeze rates for another five years will be considered on the following timeframe virginia commission staff filed its testimony and exhibits on january  and requested a million rate decrease virginia natural gas filed rebuttal testimony and exhibits on february  public evidentiary hearings will convene on february  the virginia state law authorizing pbr plans also allows a utility to withdraw or modify its pbr application at any time prior to a final ruling by the virginia commission 
virginia natural gas is currently evaluating the withdrawal or modification of its pbr plan in light of current market conditions including rising interest rates  tight natural gas supplies  rising costs and material constraints caused by lower oil supplies 
if the pbr plan is not approved or is modified by the virginia commission in a manner that virginia natural gas chooses not to accept  the virginia commission can take action in the general rate case filing 
virginia natural gas proposal would not affect its virginia commission authorized purchased gas cost  which passes gas commodity costs through to consumers 

table of contents on january   virginia natural gas filed with the virginia commission a proposed motion for approval of virginia natural gas pbr plan 
if the proposed motion is approved  the pbr plan would be implemented as filed and virginia natural gas would commit to certain actions  primarily to construct a pipeline that would connect virginia natural gas northern system to its southern system 
participants in and supporters of the proposed motion include virginia natural gas  agl resources  the virginia office of the attorney general division of consumer counsel  and the virginia industrial gas users association 
on february   the virginia commission s hearing examiner recommended that the virginia commission approve the pbr plan 
accordingly  the rate case schedule remains as previously stipulated 
weather normalization adjustment wna in september  the virginia commission approved a wna program as a two year experiment involving the use of special rates 
the wna program s purpose is to reduce the effect of weather on customer bills by reducing bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increasing bills when winter weather is warmer than normal 
in september  virginia natural gas received approval from the virginia commission to extend the wna program for an additional two years with certain modifications to the existing program 
the significant modifications include removal of the commercial class of customers from the wna program and the use of a rolling year average to calculate the weather factor that is updated annually 
florida city gas this natural gas local distribution utility operates distribution systems and related facilities in central and southern florida 
florida city gas customers purchase gas primarily for heating water  drying clothes and cooking 
some customers  mainly in central florida  also purchase gas to provide space heating during the winter season 
florida city gas is regulated by the florida public service commission 
chattanooga gas this natural gas local distribution utility operates distribution systems and related facilities in the chattanooga and cleveland areas of southeastern tennessee 
chattanooga gas base rates include a weather normalization clause that allows for revenue to be recognized based on a factor derived from average temperatures over a year period  which offsets the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on its operating income 
chattanooga gas is regulated by the tennessee regulatory authority tennessee authority 
base rate increase in june  the tennessee authority upheld its previous october order denying chattanooga gas a million rate increase 
the october order approved an increase of approximately million based on a return on equity and a capital structure of common equity

excludes the gain on the sale of our caroline street campus in we measure effects of weather on our businesses using degree days 
the measure of degree days for a given day is the difference between average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of degrees fahrenheit 
heating degree days result when the average daily actual temperature is less than the degree baseline 
generally  increased heating degree days result in greater demand for gas on our distribution systems 
compared to ebit increased million or reflecting an increase in operating margin of million  partially offset by increased operating expenses of million 
the businesses acquired from nui on november  contributed approximately million of ebit in compared to million in this was due to the full year inclusion of the nui results in compared to one month in 
table of contents the million or increase in operating margin was primarily due to the addition of nui s operations  which contributed million 
the remainder was primarily due to million of higher operating margin at atlanta gas light 
the increase at atlanta gas light resulted primarily from higher prp revenues of million and higher revenue of million from additional carrying charges for gas stored for marketers primarily due to higher gas prices 
atlanta gas light also had approximately million of increased operating margin from net customer growth  which offset a million decrease in operating revenues that resulted from the june settlement agreement with the georgia commission 
operating margin at virginia natural gas and chattanooga gas remained relatively flat compared to last year 
the million or increase in operating expenses primarily reflected the addition of nui s operations which increased operating expenses by million 
compared to there was no change in distribution operations ebit from  however  the results included a pretax gain of million on the sale of our caroline street campus  offset by an million donation to agl resources private foundation  inc exclusive of the gain and donation  ebit in increased million or due to increased operating margin  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
the million or increase in operating margin from included million in combined increases at atlanta gas light and virginia natural gas 
the increase in atlanta gas light s operating margin was primarily due to higher prp revenue as a result of continued prp capital spending  customer growth  higher customer usage and additional carrying charges from gas stored for marketers due to a higher average cost of gas 
the increase in operating margin at virginia natural gas was primarily due to customer growth 
the acquisition of nui added million of operating margin primarily from nui s december operations of elizabethtown gas and florida city gas 
operating expenses increased million or from this was due primarily to the addition of nui operations for the month of december of million 
the remaining increase of million was due to increases in the cost of outside services related to increased information technology services as a result of our ongoing implementation of a work management system  increased legal services due to increased regulatory activity  and increased accounting services related to our implementation of sox employee benefit and compensation expenses also increased primarily as a result of higher health care insurance costs and increased long term compensation expenses 
in addition  depreciation expenses increased primarily due to new depreciation rates implemented at virginia natural gas and increased assets at each utility 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense  primarily due to a tennessee authority ruling that allowed for recovery of the gas portion of accounts written off as uncollectible at chattanooga gas and increased collection efforts at both chattanooga gas and virginia natural gas 
retail energy operations our retail energy operations segment consists of southstar  a joint venture owned by our subsidiary  georgia natural gas company  and by piedmont 
southstar markets natural gas and related services to retail customers on an unregulated basis  principally in georgia 
the southstar executive committee  which acts as the governing board  comprises six members  with three representatives from us and three from piedmont 
under the joint venture agreement  all significant management decisions require the unanimous approval of the southstar executive committee  accordingly  our financial interest is considered to be noncontrolling 
although our ownership interest in the southstar partnership is  southstar s earnings are allocated to us and to piedmont  under an amended and restated joint venture agreement executed in march beginning january   we consolidated the accounts of southstar and eliminated all intercompany balances in the consolidation 
we recorded the portion of southstar s earnings that are attributable to our joint venture partner  piedmont  as a minority interest in our statements of consolidated income  and we recorded piedmont s portion of southstar s capital as a minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
competition southstar competes with other energy marketers  including marketers in georgia  to provide natural gas and related services to customers in georgia and the southeast 
based on its market share  southstar is the largest marketer of natural gas in georgia  with average customers in through in excess of  in addition  similar to distribution operations  southstar faces competition based on customer preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
southstar s principal competition relates to electric utilities and the potential displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances 
this competition with other energy products has been exacerbated by price volatility in the wholesale natural gas commodity market which has resulted in significant increases in the cost of natural gas billed to southstar s customers 

table of contents operating margin southstar generates its operating margin primarily in two ways 
the first is through the sale of natural gas to retail customers in the residential  commercial and industrial sectors  primarily in georgia 
southstar captures a spread between wholesale and retail natural gas prices and also realizes a portion of its operating margin through the collection of a monthly service fee and customer late payment fees 
southstar s operating margins are impacted by weather seasonality as well as by customer growth  and southstar s related market share in georgia  which traditionally ranges from to 
southstar employs a strategy to attract and retain a higher quality customer base through the application of stringent credit requirements 
this strategy results not only in higher operating margin contributions  as customers tend to utilize higher volumes of natural gas  but also higher ebit through a reduction in bad debt expenses 
the second way in which southstar generates margin is through the optimization of storage and transportation assets 
through its hedging transactions and derivative instruments aimed at managing exposures arising from changing commodity prices  southstar utilizes natural gas storage transactions to profit from natural gas pricing differences that occur over time 
southstar does not hold speculative derivative instruments 
southstar is actively seeking to improve its margin generating capabilities by evaluating a number of growth opportunities  including incremental customer growth in georgia and expansion of its retail model to other markets  through either organic growth or acquisition of an existing customer portfolio 
impact of high gas prices southstar s operating margin and ebit from the sales of natural gas to retail customers could be affected by conservation and bad debt trends as a result of higher natural gas prices in the winter heating season 
southstar s bad debt expense as a percentage of operating revenues of approximately for remained consistent with we believe southstar s higher quality customer base and the unregulated pricing structure in georgia mitigates our exposure to higher bad debt expenses 
results of operations the following table presents results of operations for retail energy operations for the years ended december  and  and pro forma results as if southstar s accounts were consolidated with our subsidiaries accounts for the year ended december  the unaudited pro forma results are presented for comparative purposes as a result of our consolidation of southstar in this pro forma basis is a non gaap presentation  however  we believe it is useful to readers of our financial statements since it presents the revenues and expenses for on the same basis as and in  we recognized our portion of southstar s earnings of million as equity earnings

the million or increase in operating margin was primarily the result of higher commodity margins and positive margin captured with southstar s storage assets  offset by lower use per customer and lower late payment fees relative to last year 
there was a slight decrease in operating expenses in compared to the decrease was due to lower bad debt expense resulting from ongoing collection process improvements 
minority interest increased million or as a direct result of increased operating income in compared to 
table of contents compared to the increase in ebit of million or for the year ended december  was primarily the result of higher commodity margins and decreased bad debt expense during the year 
operating margin for the year increased million or  primarily as a result of a million increase due primarily to a lower commodity cost structure resulting from continued refinement of southstar s hedging strategies and a million increase due to a full year of higher customer service charges from third party providers 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to a one time sale of stored gas in and a million decrease in late payment fees due to an improved customer base 
operating expenses increased by million or primarily due to a million increase in costs related to sox implementation and corporate overhead allocations  partially offset by lower bad debt expense resulting from collection process improvements and increased quality of customer base 
there was also a million increase in minority interest as a result of higher southstar earnings in compared to wholesale services wholesale services consists of sequent  our subsidiary involved in asset management  transportation  storage  producer and peaking services and wholesale marketing 
our asset management business focuses on capturing economic value from idle or underutilized natural gas assets  which are typically amassed by companies via investments in or contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage assets 
margin is typically created in this business by participating in transactions that balance the needs of varying markets and time horizons 
sequent provides its customers in the eastern and mid continental united states with natural gas from the major producing regions and market hubs in the country 
sequent also purchases transportation and storage capacity to meet its delivery requirements and customer obligations in the marketplace 
sequent s customers benefit from its logistics expertise and ability to deliver natural gas at prices that are advantageous relative to other alternatives available to its end use customers 
asset management transactions our asset management customers include our own utilities  nonaffiliated utilities  municipal utilities and large industrial customers 
these customers must independently contract for transportation and storage services to meet their demands  and they typically contract for these services on a day basis even though they may only need a portion of these services to meet their peak demands 
sequent enters into agreements with these customers  either through contract assignment or agency arrangement  whereby it uses their rights to transportation and storage services during periods when they do not need them 
sequent captures margin by optimizing the purchase  transportation  storage and sale of natural gas  and sequent typically either shares profits with customers or pays them a fee for using their assets 
in april  sequent commenced asset management responsibilities for elizabethtown gas  florida city gas and elkton gas 
in october  the agreement between sequent and virginia natural gas was renewed for an additional three years 
the agreement was scheduled to expire in october in january  the georgia commission extended the asset management agreement between sequent and atlanta gas light for two additional years 
the agreement was scheduled to expire in march under the terms of the extended agreement  sequent will increase its aggregate net sharing percentage paid to atlanta gas light from to on the majority of transactions sequent will initiate going forward in its role as asset manager 
the following table provides additional information on sequent s asset management agreements with its affiliated utilities

we participate in transactions to manage the natural gas commodity and transportation costs that result in the lowest cost to serve our various markets 
we seek to optimize this process on a daily basis  as market conditions change  by evaluating all the natural gas supplies  transportation alternatives and markets to which we have access and identifying the least cost alternatives to serve our various markets 
this enables us to capture geographic pricing differences across these various markets as delivered gas prices change 
in a similar manner  we participate in natural gas storage transactions where we seek to identify pricing differences that occur over time with regard to future delivery periods at multiple locations 
we capture margin by locking in the price differential between purchasing natural gas at the lowest future price and  in a related transaction  selling that gas at the highest future price  all within the constraints of our contracts 
through the use of transportation and storage services  we are able to capture margin through the arbitrage of geographical pricing differences that occur over time 
producer services our producer services business primarily focuses on aggregating natural gas supply from various small and medium sized producers located throughout the natural gas production areas of the united states  principally in the gulf coast region 
we provide producers with certain logistical and risk management services that offer them attractive options to move their supply into the pipeline grid 
aggregating volumes of natural gas from these producers allows us to provide markets to producers who seek a reliable outlet for their natural gas production 
peaking services sequent generates operating margin through  among other things  the sale of peaking services  which includes receiving a fee from affiliated and nonaffiliated customers that guarantees those customers will receive gas under peak conditions 
sequent incurs costs to support our obligations under these agreements  which are reduced in whole or in part as the matching obligations expire 
we will continue to seek new peaking transactions as well as work toward extending those that are set to expire 
competition sequent competes for asset management business with other energy wholesalers  often through a competitive bidding process 
there has been significant consolidation of energy wholesale operations  particularly among major gas producers 
financial institutions have also entered the marketplace 
as a result  energy wholesalers have become increasingly willing to place bids for asset management transactions that are priced to capture market share 
we expect this trend to continue in the near term  which could result in downward pressure on the volume of transactions and the related margins available in this portion of sequent s business 
seasonality fixed cost commitments are generally incurred evenly over the year  while margins generated through the use of these assets are generally greatest in the winter heating season and occasionally in the summer due to peak usage by power generators in meeting air conditioning load 
this increases the seasonality of our business  generally resulting in higher margins in the first and fourth quarters

the prices actively quoted category represents sequent s positions in natural gas  which are valued exclusively using new york mercantile exchange  inc nymex futures prices 
prices provided by other external sources are basis transactions that represent the cost to transport the commodity from a nymex delivery point to the contract delivery point 
our basis spreads are primarily based on quotes obtained either directly from brokers or through electronic trading platforms

sequent attempts to mitigate substantially all the commodity price risk associated with its storage portfolio 
sequent uses derivative instruments to reduce the risk associated with future changes in the price of natural gas 
sequent sells nymex futures contracts or other over the counter derivatives in forward months to substantially lock in the profit margin it will ultimately realize when the stored gas is actually sold 
natural gas stored in inventory is accounted for differently than the derivatives sequent uses to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with its storage portfolio 
the natural gas that sequent purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the lower of average cost or market 
the derivatives that sequent uses to mitigate commodity price risk are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period 
the difference in accounting can result in volatility in sequent s reported results  even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 
earnings volatility and price sensitivity the market dynamics created by the two gulf coast hurricanes significantly impacted natural gas prices  primarily in the last five months of from june  to september   the forward nymex prices through march increased on average approximately  or 
from october  to december   the same prices decreased on average approximately  or 
these market dynamics created significant market opportunities for sequent  as its storage and transportation activities created increased economic value compared to the accounting differences described above also impact the comparability of sequent s period over period results  since changes in forward nymex prices do not increase and decrease on a consistent basis from year to year 
during most of  sequent s reported results were negatively impacted by increases in forward nymex prices which resulted in the recognition of unrealized losses 
during  the reported results were not as significantly impacted by changes in forward nymex prices 
as a result  a comparison of the and reported results yielded an unfavorable variance during the first nine months of  however  the majority of these unrealized losses were recovered during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents storage inventory outlook the following table presents the nymex forward natural gas prices as of september  and december  for the period january through march  and reflects the prices at which sequent could buy natural gas at the henry hub for delivery in the same time period 
january futures expired on december   however they are included in the table below as they coincide with the january storage withdrawals 
the henry hub  located in louisiana  is the largest centralized point for natural gas spot and futures trading in the united states 
nymex uses the henry hub as the point of delivery for its natural gas futures contracts 
many natural gas marketers also use the henry hub as their physical contract delivery point or their price benchmark for spot trades of natural gas 
nymex forward natural gas prices as of sep dec change change jan feb mar avg 
the forward nymex prices decreased on average in the fourth quarter of due to warmer than normal weather in late december and the diminishing effects of hurricanes rita and katrina in the fall of sequent s original economic profit margin was unaffected by these changes in the nymex forward natural gas prices due to the hedging instruments that it has in place 
however  the decline in nymex prices during the fourth quarter of resulted in the recovery of previously reported unrealized losses associated with sequent s nymex contracts 
sequent s expected withdrawals from physical salt dome and reservoir storage are presented in the table below along with its expected gross margin 
sequent s expected gross margin is net of the impact of regulatory sharing and reflects the amounts that we would expect to realize in future periods based on the inventory withdrawal schedule and forward natural gas prices at december  sequent s storage inventory is fully hedged with futures as its nymex short positions are equal to the physical long positions  which results in an overall locked in margin  timing notwithstanding 
sequent s physical salt dome and reservoir volumes are presented in increments of  million british thermal units mmbtu 
withdrawal schedule in mmbtu expected physical salt dome physical reservoir gross margin in millions jan feb mar total after regulatory sharing the weighted average cost of natural gas in inventory was for physical salt dome storage and for physical reservoir storage 
as noted above  sequent s inventory level and pricing as of december  should result in a gross margin of approximately million through march if all factors remain the same  but could change if sequent adjusts its daily injection and withdrawal plans in response to changes in market conditions in future months 
credit rating sequent has certain trade and credit contracts that have explicit credit rating trigger events in case of a credit rating downgrade 
these rating triggers typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status 
under such circumstances  we would need to post collateral to continue transacting with some of our counterparties 
posting collateral would have a negative effect on our liquidity 
if such collateral were not posted  our ability to continue transacting with these counterparties would be impaired 
if at december  our credit ratings had been downgraded to non investment grade  the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements between sequent and its counterparties would have totaled million

sequent s operating margin increased by million or primarily due to the significant effects of the gulf coast hurricanes during the third quarter of and lingering market disruptions and price volatility throughout the fourth quarter 
for the first nine months of the year  reported operating margin was similar to that of the prior year  with quarterly decreases being offset by quarterly increases 
however  during the third quarter of  while we created substantial economic value by serving our customers during the storms  our reported operating margin was negatively impacted by accounting losses associated with our storage hedges as a result of increases in forward natural gas prices of approximately per mmbtu 
during the fourth quarter  natural gas prices continued to be volatile in the aftermath of the hurricanes and we were able to further optimize our storage and transportation positions at levels in excess of the prior year 
in addition  our previously reported hedge losses were partially recovered during the fourth quarter as forward natural gas prices decreased approximately per mmbtu 
operating expenses increased by million or due to additional payroll associated with increased headcount and increased employee incentive compensation costs driven by sequent s operational and financial growth and depreciation expense in connection with sequent s new energy trading and risk management etrm system  which was implemented during the fourth quarter of the prior year 
compared to ebit increased million or from to due to a million increase in operating margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
operating margin increased by million or primarily due to increased volatility during the fourth quarter of which provided sequent with seasonal trading  marketing  origination and asset management opportunities in excess of those experienced during the prior year 
also contributing to the increase were advantageous transportation values to the northeast and new peaking and third party asset management transactions 
sequent s sales volumes for averaged billion cubic feet per day  a increase from the prior year 
this increase resulted primarily from the addition of new counterparties  increased presence in the midwestern and northeastern markets and continued growth in origination and asset management activities  as well as business generated due to the market volatility experienced during the fourth quarter 
as a result of a decline in forward nymex prices  the results reflected the recognition of unrealized gains associated with the financial instruments used to economically hedge sequent s inventory held in storage 
if the forward nymex price in effect at december  had also been in effect at december   based on sequent s storage positions at december   sequent s reported ebit would have been million 
at december   an increase in forward nymex prices resulted in the recognition of modest unrealized losses associated with inventory hedges 
partially offsetting the improved fourth quarter results was lower volatility during the second quarter of compared to the same period in  which compressed sequent s trading and marketing activities and the related margins within its transportation portfolio 
in addition  sequent s weighted average cost of natural gas stored in inventory was per mmbtu during the first quarter of compared to per mmbtu during the same period in this significant difference in cost resulted in reduced operating margins period over period 

table of contents operating expenses increased by million or due primarily to additional salary expense as a result of an increase in the number of employees  additional costs for outside services related to the development and implementation of sequent s etrm system  the implementation of sox  and increased corporate costs 
in addition  operating expenses reflected depreciation associated with the recently implemented etrm system 
energy investments pivotal jefferson island this wholly owned subsidiary operates a salt dome storage and hub facility in louisiana  approximately eight miles from the henry hub 
the storage facility is regulated by the louisiana public service commission and by the ferc which has limited regulatory authority over the storage and transportation services 
the facility consists of two salt dome gas storage caverns with million dth mmdth of total capacity and about million mmdth of working gas capacity 
the facility has approximately  dth day withdrawal capacity and  dth day injection capacity 
pivotal jefferson island provides for storage and hub services through its direct connection to the henry hub via the sabine pipeline and its interconnection with seven other pipelines in the area 
our subsidiary pivotal energy development pivotal development is responsible for day to day operation of the facility 
pivotal jefferson island is fully subscribed for the winter period 
in october  pivotal jefferson island also announced that it is soliciting customer interest  in the form of nonbinding bids for capacity  in a project that would expand pivotal jefferson island s salt dome storage facility by from its current capacity of mmdth to as much as mmdth 
the expansion under consideration includes the development of a third and a fourth storage cavern at the facility  with each cavern having a working gas capacity of mmdth 
if there is sufficient customer interest in the project  construction would begin in early we would expect to complete the third cavern by and would expect the fourth cavern to be operational by the expansion project also includes expanding the number of pipeline interconnections in order to enhance pivotal jefferson island s flexibility with regard to storage capacity and deliverability 
in february  our board of directors approved the project and authorized it to go forward 
we expect to spend up to approximately million on the expansion project 
pivotal development s engineering estimates and the need to acquire equipment with appropriate specifications could result in increased costs and delays in the completion of the project 
pivotal jefferson island s competition is limited to other saltdome caverns in the gulf coast 
we believe that pivotal jefferson island is uniquely situated with its direct connection to the henry hub and its connection to seven other pipelines 
for these reasons we believe that pivotal jefferson island will be subscribed ahead of most of its competitors 
pivotal propane in  this wholly owned subsidiary completed the construction of a propane air facility in the virginia natural gas service area that provides up to  dth of propane air per day on a day per year basis to serve virginia natural gas peaking needs 
agl networks this wholly owned subsidiary is a provider of telecommunications conduit and dark fiber 
agl networks leases and sells its fiber to a variety of customers in the atlanta  georgia and phoenix  arizona metropolitan areas  with a small presence in other cities in the united states

agl networks typically provides underground conduit and dark fiber to its customers under leasing arrangements with terms that vary from to years 
in addition  agl networks offers telecommunications construction services to companies 
agl networks competitors are any entities that have or will lay conduit and fiber on the same route as agl networks in the respective metropolitan areas 
sale of certain nui assets in august  we sold our interest in saltville gas storage company  llc saltville and associated subsidiaries virginia gas pipeline and virginia gas storage to a subsidiary of duke energy corporation  the other partner in the saltville joint venture 
we acquired these non utility assets as part of our purchase of nui in november we received million in cash at closing  which included million in working capital adjustments  and used the proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes

table of contents compared to the million or increase in ebit in was primarily the result of increased operating margin of million  offset by million in higher operating expenses 
of the million or increase in operating margin  million resulted from pivotal jefferson island  nui s nonutility businesses  which contributed million  and pivotal propane which contributed million 
agl networks contributed million primarily from growth both in recurring revenues from fiber leasing activities of million and in construction and new business activities of million 
of the million or increase in operating expenses  million resulted from nui s nonutility businesses  million resulted from pivotal jefferson island and million resulted from pivotal propane 
agl networks operating expenses were relatively flat in as compared to compared to the increase in ebit of million was primarily the result of million from pivotal jefferson island and million from agl networks 
the remaining increase of million was from the sale of heritage propane partners  lp and the sale of a residential and retail development property in savannah  georgia in the second quarter of operating margin for the year increased million primarily as a result of the addition of pivotal jefferson island s million of operating margin and an operating margin increase at agl networks of million due to increased revenue from a variety of customers 
operating expenses decreased by million or primarily due to decreased headcount at agl networks 
corporate our corporate segment includes our nonoperating business units  including agl services company agsc  agl capital corporation agl capital and pivotal development 
agsc is a service company established in accordance with the puhca 
agl capital provides for our ongoing financing needs through a commercial paper program  the issuance of various debt and hybrid securities  and other financing arrangements 
pivotal development coordinates  among our related operating segments  the development  construction or acquisition of assets in the southeastern  mid atlantic and northeastern regions in order to extend our natural gas capabilities and improve system reliability while enhancing service to our customers in those areas 
the focus of pivotal development s commercial activities is to improve the economics of system reliability and natural gas deliverability in these targeted regions 
we allocate substantially all of agsc s and agl capital s operating expenses and interest costs to our operating segments in accordance with the puhca and state regulations 
our corporate segment also includes intercompany eliminations for transactions between our operating business segments 
our ebit results include the impact of these allocations to the various operating segments 
the acquisition of additional assets  such as nui and pivotal jefferson island  typically will enable us to allocate corporate costs across a larger number of businesses and  as a result  lower the relative allocations charged to those business units we owned prior to the acquisition of the new businesses 
agsc restructuring as a result of the nui acquisition  the associated centralization of certain administrative and operational functions and our ongoing desire to operate as efficiently as possible  we began  during the first quarter of  a review of certain functions within our agsc subsidiary 
we expect this process to be part of an ongoing effort to optimize staffing levels and work processes across our entire company 
the effects of this effort were the restructuring of certain key corporate functions and the elimination of filled and vacant positions within agsc 
we recorded a charge of million in  primarily as a result of severance related costs associated with the restructuring and elimination of the filled positions at agsc 
based on efforts performed to date  as well as actual costs incurred to date and our original basis for the earnings guidance previously provided  we estimate the annual savings from these efforts to be in the range of million to million

as such  changes in ebit amounts for the indicated periods reflect the relative changes in various general and administrative expenses  such as payroll  benefits and incentives and outside services 
compared to the million or increase in ebit for compared to was primarily due to decreased operating expenses of million 
these decreased costs were primarily due to merger and acquisition related costs incurred in but not in with respect to total operating expenses before allocations  payroll expenses in increased due to headcount in the corporate segment resulting from the acquisition of nui in november of and the realignment and transfer of certain corporate functions to agsc 
outside services expenses increased primarily due to higher costs associated with process improvement projects in the information technology  finance and human resources areas 
benefits and incentives increased primarily as a result of higher payroll related expenses 
in addition  severance expenses increased as a result of the agsc restructuring and process improvement initiatives 
compared to the decrease in ebit of million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily was due to an increase in operating expenses of million 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased outside services costs associated with software maintenance  licensing and implementation of our work management system project  higher costs due to our sox compliance efforts  merger and acquisition related expenses  and expenses related to pivotal development s activities in the increase in operating expenses was offset by a loss of million on the sale of our caroline street campus in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements we rely on operating cash flow  short term borrowings under our commercial paper program  which is backed by our supporting credit agreement credit facility  borrowings under sequent s and southstar s lines of credit  and borrowings or stock issuances in the long term capital markets 
our issuance of various securities  including long term and short term debt  is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and  through february   the sec 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation 
the availability of borrowings under our credit facility is limited and subject to a total debt to capital ratio financial covenant specified within the credit facility  which we currently meet 
we believe these sources will be sufficient for our working capital needs  debt service obligations and scheduled capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
the relatively stable operating cash flows of our distribution operations businesses currently contribute most of our cash flow from operations  and we anticipate this to continue in the future 
we will continue to evaluate our need to increase our available liquidity based on our view of working capital requirements  including the impact of changes in natural gas prices  liquidity requirements established by the rating agencies and other factors 
additionally  our liquidity and capital resource requirements may change in the future due to a number of other factors  some of which we cannot control 
these factors include the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our resulting short term borrowing requirements  which typically peak during colder months increased gas supplies required to meet our customers needs during cold weather changes in wholesale prices and customer demand for our products and services regulatory changes and changes in ratemaking policies of regulatory commissions contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments interest rate changes pension and postretirement funding requirements changes in income tax laws margin requirements resulting from significant increases or decreases in our commodity prices operational risks the impact of natural disasters  including weather 
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we have incurred various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operating and financing activities 
contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements  such as debt and lease agreements 
these obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities 
we calculate any required pension contributions using the projected unit credit cost method 
under this method  we were not required to make any pension contribution in  but we voluntarily made a million contribution in august the following table illustrates our expected future contractual obligations as of december  payments due before december  in millions total thereafter interest charges on outstanding debt pipeline charges  storage capacity and gas supply long term debt short term debt prp costs operating leases commodity and transportation charges environmental remediation costs total floating rate debt is based on the interest rate as of december  and the maturity of the underlying debt instrument 
charges recoverable through a pga mechanism or alternatively billed to marketers 
also includes demand charges associated with sequent 
a subsidiary of nui entered into two year agreements for the firm transportation and storage of natural gas during with annual aggregate demand charges of approximately million 
as a result of our acquisition of nui and in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we valued the contracts at fair value 
the million allocated to accrued pipeline demand charges in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  represents our estimate of the fair value of the acquired contracts 
the liability will be amortized over the remaining lives of the contracts 
includes million of notes payable to trusts redeemable in and includes charges recoverable through rate rider mechanisms 
we have certain operating leases with provisions for step rent or escalation payments and certain lease concessions 
we account for these leases by recognizing the future minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the respective minimum lease terms  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
however  this accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein 
southstar has natural gas purchase commitments related to the supply of minimum natural gas volumes to its customers 
these commitments are priced on an index plus premium basis 
at december   southstar had obligations under these arrangements for bcf for the year ending december  this obligation is not included in the above table 
southstar also had capacity commitments related to the purchase of transportation rights on interstate pipelines 
we also have incurred various financial commitments in the normal course of business 
contingent financial commitments represent obligations that become payable only if certain predefined events occur  such as financial guarantees  and include the nature of the guarantee and the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of us as the guarantor 
the following table illustrates our expected contingent financial commitments as of december  commitments due before dec 
 in millions total thereafter standby letters of credit  performance surety bonds 
table of contents cash flow from operating activities we prepare our statement of cash flows using the indirect method 
under this method  we reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period 
these reconciling items include depreciation  undistributed earnings from equity investments  changes in deferred income taxes  gains or losses on the sale of assets and changes in the consolidated balance sheet for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period 
year over year changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our distribution operations  wholesale services and retail energy operations segments resulting from the impact of weather  the price of natural gas  the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 
we generate a large portion of our annual net income and subsequent increases in our accounts receivable in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to significant volumes of natural gas delivered by distribution operations and southstar to our customers during the peak heating season 
in addition  our natural gas inventories  which usually peak on november  are largely drawn down in the heating season and provide a source of cash as this asset is used to satisfy winter sales demand 
during this period  our accounts payable increases to reflect payments due to providers of the natural gas commodity and pipeline capacity 
the value of the natural gas commodity can vary significantly from one period to the next as a result of the volatility in the price of natural gas 
our natural gas costs and deferred purchased natural gas costs due from or to our customers represent the difference between natural gas costs that we have paid to suppliers in the past and amounts that we have collected from customers 
these natural gas costs can cause significant variations in cash flows from period to period 
in  our net cash flow provided from operating activities was million  a decrease of million or from the same period last year 
the decrease was primarily a result of increased working capital requirements including increased spending of million for seasonal inventory injections in advance of the winter sales demand 
we spent more on these injections in primarily because of higher natural gas prices due to the effects of the hurricanes in the gulf coast region and of the full year impact associated with the purchase of natural gas for the utilities acquired in november from nui  principally for elizabethtown gas 
these higher natural gas prices resulted in a increase in the average cost of our natural gas inventories 
our operating cash flow of million for included southstar s operating cash flow of approximately million as a result of our consolidation of southstar effective january  in our operating cash flow only included amounts for cash distributions from southstar  consistent with the equity method of accounting 
excluding southstar  our cash flow from operations for was million  an increase of million from year to year changes in our operating cash flow  excluding southstar  were primarily the result of increased earnings of million and decreased spending for injection and purchase of natural gas inventories of million 
cash flow from investing activities our investing activities consisted primarily of property  plant and equipment pp e expenditures in  and and our acquisitions of nui for million and pivotal jefferson island for million in in  our investing activities included our cash payment of million for the purchase of dynegy inc s interest in southstar 
the following table provides additional information on our actual and estimated pp e expenditures 
in millions construction or preservation of distribution facilities sng pipeline prp pivotal propane plant pivotal jefferson island telecommunications other total estimated includes corporate information technology systems and infrastructure expenditures 
the increase of million or in pp e expenditures for compared to was primarily due to the million acquisition of a mile pipeline in georgia from sng and increased expenditures of million for the construction of distribution facilities  including million at elizabethtown gas and florida city gas  both of which were acquired in november also contributing to the increase was million of additional expenditures at pivotal jefferson island which completed a capital project to improve its compression capabilities 
these increases were offset by reduced prp expenditures of million due to the settlement agreement between atlanta gas light and the georgia commission that extended the program to  reduced expenditures of million at the pivotal propane plant in virginia as most of its construction expenditures were incurred last year and reduced expenditures of million at sequent as its etrm system was implemented in 
table of contents approximately of our pp e expenditures in included costs for the prp  which are approved by the georgia commission 
in the near term  the primary financial impact to us from the prp is reduced cash flow from operating and investing activities  as the timing related to cost recovery through atlanta gas light s base rates which include an allowed rate of return on its prp capital expenditures does not match the timing related to costs incurred 
we expect our future prp expenditures will primarily include larger diameter pipe than in prior years  the majority of which is located in more densely populated areas 
the following table provides more information on our expected prp expenditures 
year miles of pipe to be replaced expenditures in millions totals the increase of million or in pp e expenditures for compared to was primarily due to increased prp expenditures of million and our construction of the virginia propane plant by pivotal propane for million 
also contributing to the increase were million of expenditures for the construction of the macon peaking pipeline  million for the etrm system at sequent  million at pivotal jefferson island and million at southstar 
cash flow from financing activities our financing activities are primarily composed of borrowings and payments of short term debt  payments of medium term notes  borrowings of senior notes  distributions to minority interests  cash dividends on our common stock and the issuance of common stock 
our capitalization and financing strategy is intended to ensure that we are properly capitalized with the appropriate mix of equity and debt securities 
this strategy includes active management by us of the percentage of total debt relative to our total capitalization  as well as the term and interest rate profile of our debt securities 
we also work to maintain or improve our credit ratings on our debt to effectively manage our existing financing costs and enhance our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms 
factors we consider important in assessing our credit ratings include our balance sheet leverage  capital spending  earnings  cash flow generation  available liquidity and overall business risks 
we do not have any trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any transaction that would require us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events 
as of february  our senior unsecured debt ratings are bbb from standard poor s ratings services s p  baa from moody s investors service moody s and a from fitch ratings fitch 
in july upon the announcement of our proposed acquisition of nui  s p placed our credit ratings on creditwatch with negative implications  moody s affirmed our ratings but changed its rating outlook to negative from stable  and fitch placed our credit ratings on rating watch negative 
since the closing of the acquisition on november   s p removed us from creditwatch and changed our outlook to negative  fitch took us off rating watch negative and affirmed our ratings with a stable outlook  and moody s changed our outlook to stable 
s p has indicated that the negative outlook is the result of the execution risks in integrating the nui acquisition 
our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
if the rating agencies downgrade our ratings  particularly below investment grade  it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase 
in addition  we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings  and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease 
our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that  if not complied with  could require early payment  additional collateral support or similar actions 
our most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio  insolvency events  nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments  and acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions 
our credit facility s financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than  however  our goal is to maintain this ratio at levels between and of debt to total capitalization 
we are currently in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants 
for more information on our debt  see note 
table of contents we believe that accomplishing these capitalization objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and to allow us access to capital at reasonable costs

dollars in millions dec 
 short term debt long term debt total debt common shareholders equity total capitalization dollars in millions dec 
 short term debt long term debt total debt common shareholders equity total capitalization net of interest rate swaps 
short term debt our short term debt is composed of borrowings under our commercial paper program  sequent s lines of credit  southstar s line of credit and the current portion of our capital leases 
our short term debt financing generally increases between june and december because our payments for natural gas and pipeline capacity are generally made to suppliers prior to the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
we typically reduce short term debt balances in the spring because a significant portion of our current assets are converted into cash at the end of the winter heating season 
our credit facility was amended in august under the terms of the amendment  the term of the credit facility was extended to august  the aggregate principal amount available under the amended credit facility was increased to million  with an option to increase the aggregate cumulative principal amount available for borrowing to billion on not more than three occasions during each calendar year

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from our estimates 
each of the following critical accounting policies involves complex situations requiring a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements 
pipeline replacement program prp atlanta gas light was ordered by the georgia commission through a joint stipulation between atlanta gas light and the commission staff to undertake a prp that would replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in its system in the state of georgia within a year period beginning october  atlanta gas light initially identified  and provided notice to the georgia commission in accordance with this stipulation   miles of bare steel and cast iron pipe to be replaced 
atlanta gas light had subsequently identified an additional miles of pipe subject to replacement under this program 
on june   the georgia commission approved a settlement agreement with atlanta gas light that  among other things  extends atlanta gas light s prp by five years to require that all replacements be completed by december the timing of replacements was subsequently specified in an amendment to the prp stipulation 
this amendment  which was approved by the georgia commission on december   requires atlanta gas light to replace all cast iron pipe and of all bare steel pipe by december the remaining of bare steel pipe is required to be replaced by december approximately miles of cast iron and miles of bare steel pipe still require replacement 
the amendment also requires an evaluation by atlanta gas light and the georgia commission staff of miles of inch pipe in atlanta by december to determine if such pipe requires replacement 
if replacement of this pipe is required  the pipe must be replaced by december the additional cost to replace this pipe is projected to be approximately million 
if atlanta gas light does not perform in accordance with the initial and amended prp stipulation  it can be assessed certain nonperformance penalties 
however  to date  atlanta gas light is in full compliance 

table of contents the stipulation also provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program  which atlanta gas light has recorded as a regulatory asset 
the regulatory asset has two components the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through rate riders the future expected costs to be recovered through rate riders the determination of future expected costs involves judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the future expected costs are projected capital expenditure spending and remaining footage of infrastructure to be replaced for the remaining years of the program 
atlanta gas light recorded a long term liability of million as of december  and million as of december   which represented engineering estimates for remaining capital expenditure costs in the prp 
as of december   atlanta gas light had recorded a current liability of million  representing expected prp expenditures for the next months 
we report these estimates on an undiscounted basis 
if the recorded liability for prp had been higher or lower by million  atlanta gas light s expected recovery would have changed by approximately million 
environmental remediation liabilities atlanta gas light historically reported estimates of future remediation costs based on probabilistic models of potential costs 
we report these estimates on an undiscounted basis 
as we continue to conduct the actual remediation and enter cleanup contracts  atlanta gas light is increasingly able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of many elements of its remediation program 
these estimates contain various engineering uncertainties  and atlanta gas light continuously attempts to refine and update these engineering estimates 
our latest available estimate as of december  for those elements of the remediation program with in place contracts or engineering cost estimates is million for atlanta gas light s sites in georgia and florida 
this is a reduction of million from the estimate as of december  of projected engineering and in place contracts  resulting from program expenditures during for elements of the remediation program where atlanta gas light still cannot perform engineering cost estimates  considerable variability remains in available estimates 
the estimated remaining cost of future actions at these sites is million 
atlanta gas light estimates certain other costs it pays related to administering the remediation program and remediation of sites currently in the investigation phase 
through january  atlanta gas light estimates the administration costs to be million 
beyond  these costs are not estimable 
atlanta gas light s environmental remediation liability is included in its corresponding regulatory asset 
as of december   the regulatory asset was million  which is a combination of the accrued remediation liability and unrecovered cash expenditures 
atlanta gas light s estimate does not include other potential expenses  such as unasserted property damage  personal injury or natural resource damage claims  unbudgeted legal expenses  or other costs for which it may be held liable but with respect to which the amount cannot be reasonably forecast 
atlanta gas light s recovery of environmental remediation costs is subject to review by the georgia commission which may seek to disallow the recovery of some expenses 
in new jersey  elizabethtown gas is currently conducting remediation activities with oversight from the new jersey department of environmental protection 
although the actual total cost of future environmental investigation and remediation efforts cannot be estimated with precision  the range of reasonably probable costs is million to million 
as of december   no value within this range is better than any other value  so we recorded a liability of million 

table of contents the njbpu has authorized elizabethtown gas to recover prudently incurred remediation costs for the new jersey properties through its remediation adjustment clause 
as a result  elizabethtown gas has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately million  inclusive of interest  as of december   reflecting the future recovery of both incurred costs and future remediation liabilities in the state of new jersey 
elizabethtown gas has also been successful in recovering a portion of remediation costs incurred in new jersey from its insurance carriers and continues to pursue additional recovery 
as of december   the variation between the amounts of the environmental remediation cost liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and the associated regulatory asset is due to expenditures for environmental investigation and remediation exceeding recoveries from ratepayers and insurance carriers 
we also own several former nui remediation sites located outside of new jersey 
one site  in elizabeth city  north carolina  is subject to an order by the north carolina department of energy and natural resources 
we do not have precise estimates for the cost of investigating and remediating this site  although preliminary estimates for these costs range from million to million 
as of december   we have recorded a liability of million related to this site 
there is another site in north carolina where investigation and remediation is probable  although no regulatory order exists and we do not believe costs associated with this site can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  there are as many as six other sites with which nui had some association  although no basis for liability has been asserted 
we do not believe that costs to investigate and remediate these sites  if any  can be reasonably estimated at this time 
with respect to these costs  we currently pursue or intend to pursue recovery from ratepayers  former owners and operators and insurance carriers 
although we have been successful in recovering a portion of these remediation costs from our insurance carriers  we are not able to express a belief as to the success of additional recovery efforts 
we are working with the regulatory agencies to prudently manage our remediation costs so as to mitigate the impact of such costs on both ratepayers and shareholders 
derivatives and hedging activities sfas  as updated by sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  established accounting and reporting standards which require that every derivative financial instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
however  if the derivative transaction qualifies for and is designated as a normal purchase and sale  it is exempted from the fair value accounting treatment of sfas  as updated by sfas  and is accounted for using traditional accrual accounting 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if the derivatives meet those criteria  sfas allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge  or to record the gains and losses in other comprehensive income oci until maturity in the case of a cash flow hedge 
additionally  sfas requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment 
two areas where sfas applies are interest rate swaps and gas commodity contracts at sequent and southstar 
our derivative and hedging activities are described in further detail in note interest rate swaps we designate our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges as defined by sfas  which allows us to designate derivatives that hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability 
we record the gain or loss on fair value hedges in earnings in the period of change  together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
the effect of this accounting is to reflect in earnings only that portion of the hedge that is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
commodity related derivative instruments we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
elizabethtown gas utilizes certain derivatives for nontrading purposes to hedge the impact of market fluctuations on assets  liabilities and other contractual commitments 
pursuant to sfas  such derivative products are marked to market each reporting period 
pursuant to regulatory requirements  realized gains and losses related to such derivatives are reflected in purchased gas costs and included in billings to customers 
unrealized gains and losses are reflected as a regulatory asset loss or liability gain  as appropriate  in the consolidated balance sheet 
through sequent and southstar  we use derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas 
sequent recognizes the change in value of derivative instruments as an unrealized gain or loss in revenues in the period when the market value of the instrument changes 
sequent recognizes cash inflows and outflows associated with the settlement of its risk management activities in operating cash flows  and reports these settlements as receivables and payables in the balance sheet separately from the risk management activities reported as energy marketing receivables and trade payables 

table of contents under our risk management policy  we attempt to mitigate substantially all our commodity price risk associated with sequent s natural gas storage portfolio and lock in the economic margin at the time we enter into purchase transactions for our stored natural gas 
we purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price we pay plus storage costs is less than the market price we could receive in the future 
we lock in the economic margin by selling nymex futures contracts or other over the counter derivatives in the forward months corresponding with our withdrawal periods 
we use contracts to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially lock in the profit margin we will ultimately realize when the stored natural gas is actually sold 
these contracts meet the definition of a derivative under sfas the purchase  storage and sale of natural gas are accounted for differently from the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio 
the difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported net income  even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 
we do not currently use hedge accounting under sfas to account for this activity 
natural gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for on an accrual basis  at the lower of average cost or market  classified as inventory in our consolidated balance sheets  it is no longer marked to market following our implementation of the accounting guidance in eitf under current accounting guidance  we would recognize a loss in any period when the market price for natural gas is lower than the carrying amount of our purchased natural gas inventory 
costs to store the natural gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred 
we recognize revenues and cost of natural gas sold in our statement of consolidated income in the period we sell gas and it is delivered out of the storage facility 
the derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the margin upon the sale of stored natural gas are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period  with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change 
this difference in accounting  the accrual basis for our storage inventory versus mark to market accounting for the derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk  can result in volatility in our reported net income 
over time  gains or losses on the sale of storage inventory will be offset by losses or gains on the derivatives  resulting in realization of the economic profit margin we expected when we entered into the transactions 
this accounting difference causes sequent s earnings on its storage positions to be affected by natural gas price changes  even though the economic profits remain essentially unchanged 
sequent manages underground storage for our utilities and holds certain capacity rights on its own behalf 
the underground storage is of two types reservoir storage  where supplies are generally injected and withdrawn on a seasonal basis salt dome high deliverability storage  where supplies may be periodically injected and withdrawn on relatively short notice southstar also uses derivative instruments to manage exposures arising from changing commodity prices 
southstar s objective for holding these derivatives is to minimize volatility in wholesale commodity natural gas prices 
a portion of southstar s derivative transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges are recorded in oci and are reclassified into earnings in the same period the underlying hedged item is reflected in the income statement 
as of december   the ending balance in oci for derivative transactions designated as cash flow hedges under sfas was million 
any hedge ineffectiveness  defined as when the gains or losses on the hedging instrument do not offset the losses or gains on the hedged item  is recorded into earnings in the period in which it occurs 
southstar currently has minimal hedge ineffectiveness 
southstar s remaining derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under sfas therefore  changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the period of change 
contingencies our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities  including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables  rate matters  and legal and environmental exposures 
we accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered  and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future 
actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates can be  and often are  revised either negatively or positively  depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure 

table of contents pension and other postretirement plans our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
we annually review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement cost 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider absolute high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s corporate aa long term bond rate of and the citigroup pension liability rate of at december  we further use these market indices as a comparision to a single equivalent discount rate derived with the assistance of our actuarial advisors 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs 
prior to  we estimated the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
however  starting in  our postretirement plans have been capped at for increases in health care costs 
consequently  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care trend rate does not materially affect our periodic benefit cost for our postretirement plans 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase our accumulated projected benefit obligation by million 
a one point percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease our accumulated projected benefit obligation by million 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
at december   we had an increase in our minimum pension liability by approximately million  resulting in an aftertax loss to oci of million 
this adjustment reflected our funding contributions to the plan and updated valuations for the projected benefit obligation and plan assets 
to the extent that our future expenses and contributions increase as a result of the additional minimum pension liability  we believe that such increases are recoverable in whole or in part under future rate proceedings or mechanisms 
equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported unfunded accumulated benefit obligation abo  as the primary factors that drive the value of our unfunded abo are the assumed discount rate and the actual return on plan assets 
additionally  equity market performance has a significant effect on our market related value of plan assets mrvpa  which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets 
the mrvpa recognizes the differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology 
gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the mrvpa based on the five year moving weighted average methodology  which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense 

table of contents a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease the agl resources inc retirement plan s abo by approximately million and decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase the agl resources inc retirement plan s abo by approximately million and increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
additionally  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on assets would decrease or increase the agl resources inc retirement plan s annual pension expense by approximately million 
additionally  in we recorded a million liability for the amount of nui s projected benefit obligation in excess of the fair value of pension plan assets at the date of our acquisition of nui 
at december  our accrued liability for nui s projected obligation is million  reflecting million in adjustments for terminations and settlement of liabilities affected by the nui purchase transaction offset by net periodic benefit cost of million in a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease the nui corporation retirement plan s abo by approximately million and decrease annual benefit cost by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase the nui corporation retirement plan s abo by approximately million and increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
in addition  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the nui corporation retirement plan s expected return on assets would decrease or increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
as of december   the market value of the pension assets was million compared to a market value of million as of december  the net decrease of million resulted from contributions of million in august contributions of million in to our supplemental retirement plan an actual return on plan assets of million less benefits paid of million our million in contributions to the pension plan in reduced annual pension expense by approximately million in the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets will have an impact on our benefit obligation as of december  and our pension expense for we are unable to determine how this actual return on plan assets will affect future benefit obligation and pension expense  as actuarial assumptions and differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are determined at the time we complete our actuarial evaluation as of december  our actual returns may also be positively or negatively impacted as a result of future performance in the equity and bond markets 
accounting developments for information regarding accounting developments  see note risk factors the following are some of the factors that could affect our future performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may adversely affect our business  but the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant factors that we have identified at this time 
risks related to our business risks related to the regulation of our businesses could affect the rates we are able to charge  our costs and our profitability 
our businesses are subject to regulation by federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
in particular  at the federal level our distribution businesses have been regulated by the sec under the puhca and  effective february  will be regulated by the ferc under the puhca at the state level  our distribution businesses are regulated by the georgia commission  the tennessee authority  the njbpu  the florida commission  the virginia commission and the maryland commission 
these authorities regulate many aspects of our distribution operations  including construction and maintenance of facilities  operations  safety  rates that we can charge customers  rates of return  the authorized cost of capital  recovery of pipeline replacement and environmental remediation costs  carrying costs we charge marketers for gas held in storage for their customer accounts and relationships with our affiliates 
our ability to obtain rate increases and rate supplements to maintain our current rates of return depends on regulatory discretion  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue receiving our currently authorized rates of return 
deregulation in the natural gas industry is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components 
deregulation typically focuses on the separation of the gas distribution business from the gas sales business and is intended to cause the opening of the formerly regulated sales business to alternative unregulated suppliers of gas sales services 

table of contents in  the georgia legislature enacted the natural gas competition and deregulation act 
to date  georgia is the only state in the nation that has fully deregulated gas distribution operations  which ultimately resulted in atlanta gas light exiting the retail natural gas sales business while retaining its gas distribution operations 
gas marketers then assumed the retail gas sales responsibility at deregulated prices 
the deregulation process required atlanta gas light to completely reorganize its operations and personnel at significant expense 
it is possible that the legislature could reverse the deregulation process and require or permit atlanta gas light to provide retail gas sales service once again or require southstar to change the nature of how it provides natural gas to certain customers 
in addition  the georgia commission has statutory authority on an emergency basis to order atlanta gas light to temporarily provide the same retail gas service that it provided prior to deregulation 
if any of these events were to occur  we would incur costs to reverse the restructuring process or potentially lose the earnings opportunity embedded within the current marketing framework 
furthermore  the georgia commission has authority to change the terms under which we charge marketers for certain supply related services  which could also affect our future earnings 
we have a concentration of credit risk in georgia  which could expose a significant portion of our accounts receivable to collection risks 
we have a concentration of credit risk related to the provision of natural gas services to georgia marketers 
at september  prior to deregulation  atlanta gas light had approximately million end use customers in georgia 
in contrast  at december   atlanta gas light had only certificated and active marketers in georgia  four of which based on customer count and including southstar accounted for approximately of our consolidated operating margin for as a result  atlanta gas light now depends on a concentrated number of customers for revenues 
the failure of these marketers to pay atlanta gas light could adversely affect atlanta gas light s business and results of operations and expose it to difficulties in collecting atlanta gas light s accounts receivable 
additionally  southstar markets directly to end use customers and has periodically experienced credit losses as a result of cold weather  variable prices and customers inability to pay 
the cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits to eligible former employees is subject to changes in pension fund values and changing demographics and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all full time employees and qualified retirees 
the cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets and changing demographics  including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five years 
any sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields may have a material adverse effect on the value of our pension funds 
in these circumstances  we may be required to recognize an increased pension expense or a charge to our statement of consolidated income to the extent that the pension fund values are less than the total anticipated liability under the plans 
we face increasing competition  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenues  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
the natural gas business is highly competitive  and we are facing increasing competition from other companies that supply energy  including electric companies  oil and propane providers and  in some cases  energy marketing and trading companies 
in particular  the success of our investment in southstar is affected by the competition southstar faces from other energy marketers providing retail natural gas services in the southeast 
natural gas competes with other forms of energy 
the primary competitive factor is price 
changes in the price or availability of natural gas relative to other forms of energy and the ability of end users to convert to alternative fuels affect the demand for natural gas 
in the case of commercial  industrial and agricultural customers  adverse economic conditions  including higher gas costs  could also cause these customers to bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per unit costs or disconnect from our system 

table of contents our wholesale services segment competes with larger  full service energy providers  which may limit our ability to grow our business 
our wholesale services segment competes with national and regional full service energy providers  energy merchants  and producers and pipelines for sales based on our ability to aggregate competitively priced commodities with transportation and storage capacity 
some of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are and have more national and global exposure than we do 
the consolidation of this industry and the pricing to gain market share may affect our margins 
we expect this trend to continue in the near term  and the increasing competition for asset management deals could result in downward pressure on the volume of transactions and the related margins available in this portion of sequent s business 
our asset management arrangements between sequent and our affiliated local distribution companies and between sequent and its nonaffiliated customers may not be renewed or may be renewed at lower levels  which could have a significant impact on sequent s business 
sequent currently manages the storage and transportation assets of our affiliates atlanta gas light  elizabethtown gas  virginia natural gas  florida city gas and chattanooga gas and shares profits it earns from the management of those assets with those customers and their customers  except at elizabethtown gas and elkton gas where sequent is assessed an annual fixed fee payment 
in addition  sequent has asset management agreements with certain nonaffiliated customers 
entry into and renewal of these agreements are subject to regulatory approval 
sequent s results could be significantly impacted if these agreements are not renewed or are amended or renewed with less favorable terms 
our profitability may decline if the counterparties to sequent s asset management transactions fail to perform in accordance with sequent s agreements 
sequent focuses on capturing the value from idle or underutilized energy assets  typically by executing transactions that balance the needs of various markets and time horizons 
sequent is exposed to the risk that counterparties to our transactions will not perform their obligations 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  we might be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements  honor the underlying commitment at then current market prices or return a significant portion of the consideration received for gas under a long term contract 
in such events  we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts  if any  already paid to or received from counterparties 
we have a concentration of credit risk at sequent that could expose us to collection risks 
we often extend credit to our counterparties 
despite performing credit analyses prior to extending credit and seeking to effectuate netting agreements  we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 
if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral we have secured is inadequate  we could experience material financial losses 
we have a concentration of credit risk at sequent  which could expose a significant portion of our credit exposure to collection risks 
approximately of sequent s credit exposure is concentrated in counterparties 
although most of this concentration is with counterparties that are either load serving utilities or end use customers and that have supplied some level of credit support  default by any of these counterparties in their obligations to pay amounts due sequent could result in credit losses that would negatively impact our wholesale services segment 
we are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in wholesale services 
the commodity  storage and transportation portfolios at sequent consist of contracts to buy and sell natural gas commodities  including contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate  we could experience financial losses from our trading activities 
value at risk var is defined as the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability 
based on a confidence interval and employing a day and a day holding period for all positions  sequent s portfolio of positions as of december  had a day holding period var of million and day holding period var of million 
our accounting results may not be indicative of the risks we are taking or the economic results we expect due to changes in accounting for wholesale services 
although sequent enters into various contracts to hedge the value of our energy assets and operations  the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges does not always match up with the profits or losses on the item being hedged 
the difference in accounting can result in volatility in sequent s reported results  even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 

table of contents our business is subject to environmental regulation in all jurisdictions in which we operate and our costs to comply are significant  and any changes in existing environmental regulation could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal  state and municipal laws and regulations 
such environmental legislation imposes  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances into the environment 
environmental legislation also requires that our facilities  sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
our current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant to our results of operations and financial condition 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may expose us to fines  penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations 
in addition  claims against us under environmental laws and regulations could result in material costs and liabilities 
existing environmental regulations could also be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur 
with the trend toward stricter standards  greater regulation  more extensive permit requirements and an increase in the number and types of assets operated by us subject to environmental regulation  our environmental expenditures could increase in the future  particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers 
additionally  the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions could give rise to expenditures and liabilities  including fines or penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we could incur additional material costs for the environmental condition of some of our assets  including former manufactured gas plants 
we are generally responsible for all on site and certain off site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the natural gas assets that we have operated  acquired or developed  regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are or were known or unknown 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets  we may obtain  or be required to provide  indemnification against certain environmental liabilities 
before natural gas was widely available in the southeast  we manufactured gas from coal and other fuels 
those manufacturing operations were known as manufactured gas plants  or mgps  which we ceased operating in the s 
we have identified sites in georgia and in florida where we  or our predecessors  own or owned all or part of a mgp site 
we are required to investigate possible environmental contamination at those mgp sites and  if necessary  clean up any contamination 
to date  cleanup has been completed at these sites  and as of december   the soil and sediment remediation program was complete for all georgia sites  although groundwater cleanup continues 
as of december   projected costs associated with the mgp sites were million 
for elements of the mgp program where we still cannot provide engineering cost estimates  considerable variability remains in available future cost estimates 
in addition  we are associated with former sites in new jersey  north carolina and other states that we assumed with our acquisition of nui in november material cleanups of these sites have not been completed nor are precise estimates available for future cleanup costs 
for the new jersey sites  cleanup cost estimates range from million to million 
costs have been estimated for only of the non new jersey sites  for which current estimates range from million to million 
our growth may be restricted by the capital intensive nature of our business 
we must construct additions to our natural gas distribution system each year to continue the expansion of our customer base 
the cost of this construction may be affected by the cost of obtaining government approvals  development project delays or changes in project costs 
weather  general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost of a project 
our cash flows are not fully adequate to finance the cost of this construction 
as a result  we must fund a portion of our cash needs through borrowings and the issuance of common stock 
this may limit our ability to increase infrastructure to connect customers due to limits on the amount we can economically invest  which shifts costs to potential customers 
this may make it uneconomical for these potential customers to connect to our distribution systems 

table of contents changes in weather conditions may affect our earnings 
weather conditions and other natural phenomena can have a large impact on our earnings 
severe weather conditions can impact our suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to our distribution system 
extended mild weather  during either the winter period or summer period  can have a significant impact on demand for and the cost of natural gas 
we have a wna mechanism for elizabethtown gas  chattanooga gas and virginia natural gas that partially offsets the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on residential and commercial customer billings and margin 
the wna is most effective in a reasonable temperature range relative to normal weather using historical averages 
the protection afforded by the wna depends on continued regulatory approval 
the loss of this continued regulatory approval could make us more susceptible to weather related earnings fluctuations 
inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 
inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses and has required us to replace assets at higher costs 
we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates 
historically  we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so 
the ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results 
rapid increases in the price of purchased gas cause us to experience a significant increase in short term debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased  which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered 
increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable 
this situation also results in higher short term debt levels and increased bad debt expense 
should the price of purchased gas increase significantly in the upcoming heating season  we would expect increases in our short term debt  accounts receivable and bad debt expense during finally  higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our utility customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods or switching to other more efficient competing products 
the higher costs have also allowed products utilizing energy sources other than natural gas for applications that have traditionally used natural gas to be in more competitive position  encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources 
a decrease in the availability of adequate pipeline transportation capacity could reduce our revenues and profits 
our gas supply depends on the availability of adequate pipeline transportation and storage capacity 
we purchase a substantial portion of our gas supply from interstate sources 
interstate pipeline companies transport the gas to our system 
a decrease in interstate pipeline capacity available to us or an increase in competition for interstate pipeline transportation and storage service could reduce our normal interstate supply of gas 
risks related to our corporate and financial structure if we breach any of the material financial covenants under our various indentures  credit facilities or guarantees  our debt service obligations could be accelerated 
our existing debt and the debt of certain of our subsidiaries contain a number of significant financial covenants 
if we or any of these subsidiaries breach any of the financial covenants under these agreements  our debt repayment obligations under them could be accelerated 
in such event  we may not be able to refinance or repay all our indebtedness  which would result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of cross default provisions in our borrowing arrangements  we may be unable to satisfy all our outstanding obligations in the event of a default on our part 
our credit facility and the indenture under which atlanta gas light s outstanding medium term notes were issued contain cross default provisions 
accordingly  should an event of default occur under some of our debt agreements  we face the prospect of being in default under other of our debt agreements  obliged in such instance to satisfy a large portion of our outstanding indebtedness and unable to satisfy all our outstanding obligations simultaneously 

table of contents we depend on our ability to successfully access the capital markets 
any inability to access the capital or financial markets may limit our ability to execute our business plan or pursue improvements that we may rely on for future growth 
we rely on access to both short term money markets in the form of commercial paper and lines of credit and long term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations 
if we are not able to access financial markets at competitive rates  our ability to implement our business plan and strategy will be affected 
certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access one or more financial markets 
such market disruptions could result from adverse economic conditions adverse general capital market conditions poor performance and health of the utility industry in general bankruptcy or financial distress of unrelated energy companies or marketers in georgia significant decrease in the demand for natural gas adverse regulatory actions that affect our local gas distribution companies terrorist attacks on our facilities or our suppliers extreme weather conditions a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital 
s p  moody s and fitch currently assign our senior unsecured debt a rating of bbb  baa and a  respectively 
our commercial paper currently is rated a  p and f by s p  moody s and fitch  respectively 
if the rating agencies downgrade our ratings  particularly below investment grade  it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase 
in addition  we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease 
additionally  if our credit rating by either s p or moody s falls to non investment grade status  we will be required to provide additional support for certain customers of our wholesale business 
as of december   if our credit rating had fallen below investment grade  we would have been required to provide collateral of approximately million to continue conducting our wholesale services business with certain counterparties 
the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 
we use derivatives  including futures  forwards and swaps  to manage our commodity and financial market risks 
we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts 
we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt  which could lead to changes in interest expense 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
in order to maintain our desired mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  we use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements  without exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in structuring such swap agreements to effectively manage our risks 
if we are unable to do so  our earnings may be reduced 
in addition  higher interest rates  all other things equal  reduce the earnings that we derive from transactions where we capture the difference between authorized returns and short term borrowings 

table of contents risks related to our industry transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 
our gas distribution activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks  such as leaks  accidents and mechanical problems  which could cause substantial financial losses 
in addition  these risks could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution and impairment of our operations  which in turn could lead to substantial losses to us 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
natural disasters  terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our businesses 
natural disasters may damage our assets 
the threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the united states and its allies may lead to increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations 
in addition  future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states  and companies in the energy industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
the insurance industry has also been disrupted by these events 
as a result  the availability of insurance covering risks against which we and our competitors typically insure may be limited 
in addition  the insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles  higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates and credit 
commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business 
credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is particularly concentrated at atlanta gas light in distribution operations and in wholesale services 
our risk management committee rmc is responsible for establishing the overall risk management policies and monitoring compliance with  and adherence to  the terms within these policies  including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels 
our rmc consists of senior executives who monitor commodity price risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities 
it is chaired by our chief risk officer  who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the rmc to perform its monitoring functions 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatments are described in further detail in note commodity price risk retail energy operations southstar s use of derivatives is governed by a risk management policy  created and monitored by its risk management committee  which prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
a confidence interval is used to evaluate var exposure 
a confidence interval means there is a probability that the actual change in portfolio value will be greater than the calculated var value over the holding period 
we calculate var based on the variance covariance technique 
this technique requires several assumptions for the basis of the calculation  such as price volatility  confidence interval and holding period 
our var may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because  although var is a common metric in the energy industry  there is no established industry standard for calculating var or for the assumptions underlying such calculations 
the following table provides more information on southstar s day and day holding period var 
in millions day day period end period end southstar generates operating margin from the active management of storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions and derivative instruments aimed at managing exposures arising from changing commodity prices 
southstar uses these hedging instruments to lock in economic margins as spreads between wholesale and retail commodity prices widen between periods and thereby minimize its exposure to declining operating margins 

table of contents wholesale services this segment routinely utilizes various types of financial and other instruments to mitigate certain commodity price risks inherent in the natural gas industry 
these instruments include a variety of exchange traded and over the counter energy contracts  such as forward contracts  futures contracts  options contracts and financial swap agreements 
the following table includes the fair values and average values of our energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities as of december  and we base the average values on monthly averages for the months ended december  and average values at december  in millions asset liability value at december  in millions asset liability we employ a systematic approach to evaluating and managing the risks associated with our contracts related to wholesale marketing and risk management  including var 
similar to southstar  sequent uses a day and a day holding period and a confidence interval to evaluate its var exposure 
sequent s open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management  including the chief risk officer 
because sequent generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures markets  its open exposure is generally minimal  permitting sequent to operate within relatively low var limits 
sequent employs daily risk testing  using both var and stress testing  to evaluate the risks of its open positions 
sequent s management actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting var 
sequent continues to maintain a relatively matched book  where its total buy volume is close to sell volume  with minimal open commodity risk 
based on a confidence interval and employing a day and a day holding period for all positions  sequent s portfolio of positions for the months ended december   and had the following day and day holding period vars 
in millions day day period end month average high low period end month average high low period end month average high low values represent amounts less than million 
during sequent experienced increases in its high  month average and period end day and day var amounts 
these increases were directly associated with the market impacts and related price volatility created by the gulf coast hurricanes during the third quarter and the lingering effects through year end 
interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
our policy is to manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
to facilitate the achievement of desired fixed rate to variable rate debt ratios  agl capital entered into interest rate swaps whereby it agreed to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable amounts calculated by reference to agreed on notional principal amounts 
these swaps are designated to hedge the fair values of million of the million senior notes due at the beginning of  we had million of outstanding interest rate swap agreements associated with our note payable at agl capital trust ii 
on september   we terminated these interest rate swap agreements 
we received a payment of million related to this termination  which included accrued interest and the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements at the termination date 
in september  we also executed five treasury lock agreements totaling million to hedge the interest rate risk associated with an anticipated financing 
the agreements will result in a interest rate on the year united states treasury bond against which we will be measured in issuing our own debt instruments and were designated as cash flow hedges against the future interest payments on the anticipated financing 

table of contents credit risk distribution operations atlanta gas light has a concentration of credit risk because it bills only marketers in georgia for its services 
the credit risk exposure to marketers varies with the time of the year  with exposure at its lowest in the nonpeak summer months and highest in the peak winter months 
marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end use customers in georgia 
these retail functions include customer service  billing  collections  and the purchase and sale of the natural gas commodity 
these marketers  in turn  bill end use customers 
the provisions of atlanta gas light s tariff allow atlanta gas light to obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a marketer s highest month s estimated bill from atlanta gas light 
for  the largest marketers based on customer count  one of which was southstar  accounted for approximately of our consolidated operating margin and of distribution operations operating margin 
several factors are designed to mitigate our risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation 
in addition to the security support described above  atlanta gas light bills intrastate delivery service to marketers in advance rather than in arrears 
we accept credit support in the form of cash deposits  letters of credit surety bonds from acceptable issuers and corporate guarantees from investment grade entities 
the rmc reviews on a monthly basis the adequacy of credit support coverage  credit rating profiles of credit support providers and payment status of each marketer 
we believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify  manage and report on atlanta gas light s credit risk exposure to marketers 
atlanta gas light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments to marketers of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity 
although atlanta gas light assigns this capacity to marketers  in the event that a marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity  the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from atlanta gas light 
the fact that some of the interstate pipelines require marketers to maintain security for their obligations to the interstate pipelines arising out of the assigned capacity somewhat mitigates this risk 
retail energy operations southstar credit scores firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency and enrolls  without security  only those customers that meet or exceed southstar s credit threshold 
the average credit score of southstar s georgia customers has increased since southstar investigates potential interruptible and large commercial customers through reference checks  review of publicly available financial statements and review of commercially available credit reports 
prior to entering into a physical transaction  southstar also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on their moody s  s p and fitch ratings  commercially available credit reports and audited financial statements 
wholesale services sequent has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties  as well as the quality of pledged collateral 
sequent also utilizes master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk 
when sequent is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and it also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty  the net mark to market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of sequent s credit risk 
sequent also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions 
master netting agreements enable sequent to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty 
sequent also nets across product lines and against cash collateral  provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions 
additionally  sequent may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary 
sequent conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for its counterparty s line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed 
in most cases  the counterparty must have a minimum long term debt rating of baa from moody s and bbb from s p 
generally  sequent requires credit enhancements by way of guaranty  cash deposit or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not meet the minimum ratings threshold 
sequent  which provides services to marketers and utility and industrial customers  also has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its day receivable exposure plus forward exposure 
as of december   sequent s top counterparties represented approximately of the total counterparty exposure of million  derived by adding together the top counterparties exposures and dividing by the total of sequent s counterparties exposures 
as of december   sequent s counterparties  or the counterparties guarantors  had a weighted average s p equivalent credit rating of a  which is consistent with the prior year 
the s p equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the s p or moody s ratings to an internal rating ranging from to  with being equivalent to aaa aaa by s p and moody s and being d or default by s p and moody s 
a counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty 

table of contents to arrive at the weighted average credit rating  each counterparty s assigned internal rating is multiplied by the counterparty s credit exposure and summed for all counterparties 
that sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties exposures  and this numeric value is then converted to an s p equivalent 
the following tables show sequent s commodity receivable and payable positions as of december  and as of december  in millions gross receivables receivables with netting agreements in place counterparty is investment grade counterparty is non investment grade counterparty has no external rating receivables without netting agreements in place counterparty is investment grade counterparty is non investment grade counterparty has no external rating amount recorded on balance sheet gross payables payables with netting agreements in place counterparty is investment grade counterparty is non investment grade counterparty has no external rating payables without netting agreements in place counterparty is investment grade counterparty is non investment grade counterparty has no external rating amount recorded on balance sheet sequent has certain trade and credit contracts that have explicit rating trigger events in case of a credit rating downgrade 
these rating triggers typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non investment grade status 
under such circumstances  sequent would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of its counterparties 
posting collateral would have a negative effect on our liquidity 
if such collateral were not posted  sequent s ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be impaired 
if at december  sequent s credit ratings had been downgraded to non investment grade status  the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements between sequent and its counterparties would have totaled million
