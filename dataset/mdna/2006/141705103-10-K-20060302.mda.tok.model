item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following md a is to help facilitate an understanding of the significant factors influencing our historical operating results  financial condition and cash flows and also to convey management s expectations of the potential impact of known trends  events or uncertainties that may materially impact future results 
this md a contains forward looking statements as described on page i of this annual report on form k 
our md a should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
overview we are one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states 
our services assist employers  insurance companies  unions  government employee groups  managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in delivering prescription drugs in a cost effective manner 
our pharmaceutical services are generally referred to as pharmacy benefit management  or pbm  services and involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the costs and improving the safety  effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use 
we generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs  either directly through our mail service pharmacies or indirectly through our network of third party retail pharmacies  and through providing certain other services  including disease management  health benefits management and data access to our customers  which are primarily employers  unions  government employee groups  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states 
our net revenue represents amounts earned from both our customers and the participants in our customers health benefit plans and includes copayments paid by participants both to us  for prescriptions filled from the pharmacies we own  and to the third party pharmacies in our retail network  for most retail prescriptions 
our net revenues reflect the effects of any discounts provided to our customers 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for detailed information concerning our revenue recognition policies 
we generate cost savings for our customers primarily by negotiating for the discounted purchase of pharmaceutical products dispensed to their participants 
we purchase pharmaceutical products from  and negotiate various forms of discounts from established list prices with  pharmaceutical manufacturers  pharmaceutical wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
when we purchase pharmaceutical products directly from their manufacturer  as is typically the case with generic and biotech products  we generally receive any negotiated discount at the time of purchase 
when we purchase pharmaceutical products indirectly eg  through a wholesaler or from a retail pharmacy at the point of dispensing  as is typically the case with brand name  nonbiotech products  we generally receive a discount from the vendor and  in many cases  the product s manufacturer 
in these cases  the vendor discount is received at the time of purchase  however  the manufacturer discount is received after the product is dispensed 
our cost of revenues reflects the effects of these discounts 
the prices we have negotiated with our customers for the pharmaceutical products we dispense to their participants are generally based on contractual discounts from established list prices and may also include additional discounts based on the type ie  preferred brand  non preferred brand  generic  etc 
of prescriptions filled 
the prices in our vendor contracts with various parties manufacturers  wholesalers  retail pharmacies  etc 
for the purchase of these pharmaceuticals are also based on discounts from established list prices plus  in many cases  additional discounts in the form of prompt payment terms and or rebates 
additionally  both our customer and vendor contracts typically contain clauses which would allow us to renegotiate pricing in the event that legislation or other events limiting or eliminating the various discounting practices in the pharmaceutical industry  including the practice of providing discounts in the form of rebates  were to occur 
we generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs on behalf of our customers 
we dispense these prescriptions drugs through our seven large  automated mail service pharmacies  our smaller  regional mail service pharmacies and a nationwide network composed of over  retail pharmacies with which we have contracted to purchase pharmaceuticals on behalf of our customers for immediate delivery to their participants 
one customer  the federal employees health benefit plan  accounted for approximately of our net revenue in critical accounting policies and estimates income taxes 
we previously had a significant deferred tax asset related to federal and state income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards that were primarily generated from losses incurred in our discontinued ppm business 
the significant majority of these nols were utilized to offset taxable income for the year ended december  and prior years 
due to the complexity of our discontinued operations divestiture and the fact that the tax periods in which the nols were generated can be audited well beyond a normal three year statutory audit period  the amount of the nols which may ultimately be realized may vary materially from the amount utilized to offset taxable income 
we have established an accrual for tax related contingencies primarily related to issues which may arise from the tax periods when the nols were generated 
this accrual is based on our estimates of the amount of benefit from the nols that we may ultimately be unable to realize 
subsequent revisions to the accrual for tax related contingencies may cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
estimates concerning contingencies 
generally accepted accounting principles specify the criteria for disclosing contingent losses and recording any related estimate of the loss amount 
these criteria are based on both probability assessments of the eventual outcome of the contingent event and on the availability of information necessary to estimate the amount of the loss 
if it is determined that i it is probable a material loss has been incurred and ii the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated  the nature of the loss should be disclosed  and an estimate of the loss should be recorded 
if it is reasonably possible that a material loss has been incurred  the nature of the possible loss should be disclosed along with an estimate of the amount of the loss if it is available 
to the extent that the incurrence of a material loss is judged remote  no disclosure is required 
the most significant contingencies to which we are exposed  other than the tax related contingencies discussed above  relate to damages sought by claimants under various lawsuits and investigations 
the specific cases for which we believe it may be at least reasonably possible that we have incurred a loss are discussed further at item  legal proceedings and in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
probability estimates related to the anticipated outcomes of lawsuits investigations and to the amounts of damages which may ultimately be awarded are inherently uncertain 
we have made our estimates based on all available facts and circumstances existing as of the date such estimates were made 
although these estimates have been made based on our prior experience with litigation investigations  our knowledge of the details of each case  and  in many cases  our consultation with external legal counsel  the actual outcome of pending litigation and investigations could differ materially from our estimates 
accounts receivable valuation allowances 
we are exposed to credit losses from accounts receivable that are recorded as assets in our financial statements but may ultimately be uncollectible and to adjustments to accounts receivable based on contractual interpretations and customer audits 
we perform detailed analyses of accounts receivable and related data on a monthly basis and have attempted to allow for expected adjustments based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable 
we believe our accounts receivable valuation allowances to be adequate  however  it is possible that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation processes to make them as reactive to these changes as possible  however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate the amounts of these accounts receivable that will ultimately be collected 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to market our services profitably  which is  in turn  heavily dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate discounts for pharmaceutical purchases at various points in our supply chain and to successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
our future operating results and financial condition may be affected by a number of additional factors  including  but not limited to i identification of  and competition for  growth and expansion opportunities  ii our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers  iii declining reimbursement levels for  or increases in the costs of  products dispensed  iv the timing and launch of generic pharmaceutical products into the marketplace  v exposure to liabilities in excess of our insurance  vi compliance with  or changes in  government regulation and legislation  including  but not limited to  pharmacy licensing requirements and healthcare reform legislation  vii our participation in the federal government s medicare part d program  viii adverse developments in the healthcare or pharmaceutical industry generally  including  but not limited to  developments in any investigation related to the pharmaceutical industry that may be conducted by governmental authorities  ix adverse resolution of existing or future lawsuits or investigations  and x the availability of prescription drug products in the marketplace as affected by product recalls and voluntary product withdrawals by manufacturers 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition 
there are various legal matters which  if adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

these amounts are included in total depreciation for each period 
operating income equals net revenue less cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock option expense and integration and other related expenses 
operating income is computed in accordance with sec rules  however  it is subject to the same limitations as our presentation of ebitda as described at below 
we believe that ebitda  which is a non gaap financial measure  is a supplemental measurement tool used by analysts and investors to help evaluate a company s overall operating performance  its ability to incur and service debt and its capacity for making capital expenditures 
we use ebitda  in addition to operating income and cash flows from operating activities  to assess our liquidity and performance and believe that it is important for investors to be able to evaluate our company using the same measures used by our management 
ebitda can be reconciled to net cash provided by continuing operations  which we believe to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  as follows in thousands year ended december  net income depreciation and amortization interest income expense  net provision for income taxes ebitda cash interest receipts payments  net cash tax payments refunds  net non operating gain  net other non cash expenses other changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions disposals of businesses net cash provided by continuing operations ebitda does not represent funds available for our discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flow from operations data as measured under gaap 
the items excluded from ebitda are significant components of our statement of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of our overall financial performance 
ebitda and the associated year to year trends should not be considered in isolation 
our calculation of ebitda may not be consistent with calculations of ebitda used by other companies 
includes approximately billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively  of amounts paid by individual participants in our customers benefit plans directly to the third party pharmacies in our retail networks ie  retail copayments 
pro forma operating results the following table sets forth selected pro forma information about our results of operations for the years ended december   and this pro forma information was prepared as if the advancepcs acquisition had been consummated at the beginning of each respective period 
additional information concerning the pro forma presentation appears in note  acquisition of advancepcs and integration plan  to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k

the results of operations of advancepcs are included in our statement of income beginning march  the primary factor influencing the comparison of our results of operations for compared to was the advancepcs acquisition 
net revenue 
net revenue increased by approximately billion to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in on a pro forma basis  net revenue increased by approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in pro forma revenue growth primarily reflects increases due to drug cost inflation partially offset by a higher dispensing rate of generic drugs  which have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers  that had the effect of reducing revenues 
excluding the impact of higher generic dispensing rates  pro forma revenues for the year ended december   would have increased approximately over the pro forma amount 
on a pro forma basis  revenues from mail service claims increased approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this increase results from an increase in mail service claim volume of approximately and an increase in average revenue per mail service claim of approximately 
the mail service claim volume increases are related to increases from both new customers and the percentage of mail service claims adjusted for differences in average days supply to total pharmacy claims  referred to as our mail penetration rate 
the increase in mail service claim volume and the mail penetration rate during is due primarily to the fact that new customer starts in were substantially mail order  while several large retail oriented customers terminated during and on a pro forma basis  our mail penetration rate was approximately in  compared to a mail penetration rate of in the increase in average revenue per mail service claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates as described above 
on a pro forma basis  our mail service generic dispensing rate was in  compared to a mail service generic dispensing rate of in on a pro forma basis  revenues from retail claims decreased approximately million  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this decrease is the result of a decrease in retail claim volume of approximately offset by an increase in average revenue per retail claim of approximately 
the increase in average revenue per retail claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates 
on a pro forma basis  our retail generic dispensing rate was in  compared to a retail generic dispensing rate of in the retail claim volume decrease is primarily related to the termination of several large retail oriented accounts as described above 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased approximately billion to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in pro forma cost of revenues for as a percentage of net revenue decreased by compared to and was favorably impacted by economies of scale resulting from the advancepcs acquisition 
pro forma cost of revenue growth and cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenue were also impacted by a higher dispensing rate of generic drugs which have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers 
pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues increased by approximately million  or  on a pro forma basis to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase relates primarily to additional customer service center and pharmacy costs incurred to service the overall increases in mail service claims in from levels experienced in pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues remained flat as a percentage of revenue on a pro forma basis at in and in addition  during  the company incurred additional expenses to implement the substantial amount of net new business  which was weighted significantly toward mail service 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis in  due primarily to the advancepcs acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by on an absolute basis and decreased as a percentage of net revenue  to from primarily reflecting the impact of elimination of duplicative costs subsequent to the advancepcs acquisition 
depreciation 
depreciation increased in due primarily to the advancepcs acquisition 
depreciation increased in on a pro forma basis  due primarily to the amounts and timing of depreciation related to capital expenditures made to increase capacities in our mail service pharmacies and customer service centers 
depreciation expense is expected to total approximately million to million in amortization of intangible assets 
the amortization of intangible assets recorded in and was related entirely to the intangible assets acquired from advancepcs on march  amortization of intangible assets is expected to total approximately million in interest income expense  net 
the change in net interest income expense in resulted primarily from increased interest income generated by cash on hand and short term investments and a decrease in interest expense on long term debt due to principal repayments 
net interest income is expected to total approximately million to million in this estimate may vary based on interest rates during the year  as well as the amount of cash that we have invested  which can vary based on share repurchase activity and other cash uses 
stock option expense 
the stock option expense recorded in and relates to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options held by advancepcs optionees on the date of the advancepcs acquisition 
the amount to be expensed will change from the remaining unvested intrinsic value to the remaining unvested fair value as determined on the date of the advancepcs acquisition beginning january   due to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r as amended  share based payment  fas r 
additionally  the fair value of all other outstanding  unvested stock options will begin to be expensed over the remaining vesting periods of the underlying options upon our adoption of fas r 
we expect share based compensation to total approximately to million in integration and other related expenses 
the decrease in integration and other related expenses primarily reflects costs incurred for outside consulting services for integration planning activities in that were not incurred in we incurred approximately million of integration and other related expenses for the year ended december   primarily for integration activities related to our acquisition of advancepcs and involuntary termination employee retention and related benefits 
we incurred approximately million of integration and other related expenses for the year ended december   consisting primarily of approximately million for involuntary termination benefits  a writeoff of approximately million of deferred loan costs for indebtedness retired in conjunction with the closing of the advancepcs acquisition  approximately million of integration planning activities related to the advancepcs acquisition and approximately million related to retention benefit obligations under the advancepcs retention plan 
the balance of the costs incurred in relate primarily to payments to outside service vendors used for various integration related projects 
in  we expect integration and other related expenses to be minimal and anticipate that such expense will no longer be presented separately 
non operating gain  net 
non operating gain  net is primarily comprised of a million gain on the sale of our remaining investment in a private company that was formerly one of our subsidiaries 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was recorded using a effective tax rate on book income in compared to an approximately effective tax rate on book income in the decrease related to a positive adjustment to the provision for income taxes  primarily to reflect resolution of income tax uncertainties from prior periods 
results of operations for compared to advancepcs operating results 
the results of operations of advancepcs for the period march  through december   are included in our statement of income for the year ended december  the primary factor influencing the comparison of our results of operations for compared to was the advancepcs acquisition 
net revenue 
net revenue increased by approximately billion to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in on a pro forma basis  net revenue increased by approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in pro forma revenues for the year ended december   were reduced by approximately billion from amounts recorded in the same period in due to the previously announced renewal of a large contract and a corresponding change in revenue recognition for this contract from a gross basis to a net basis 
this accounting change had no impact on net income 
pro forma revenue growth was also reduced by a higher dispensing rate of generic drugs that have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers 
excluding the impact of higher generic dispensing rates  pro forma revenues for the year ended december   would have increased approximately over the pro forma amount  reflecting drug cost inflation and net new business in on a pro forma basis  revenues from mail service claims increased approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this increase resulted from an increase in mail service claim volume of approximately and an increase in average revenue per mail service claim of approximately 
the increase in mail service claim volume was related to both increases from new customers and an increase in the mail penetration rate 
on a pro forma basis  our mail penetration rate was approximately in  compared to a mail penetration rate of in the increase in average revenue per mail service claim reflected increases in the prices of products dispensed as well as a slight change in overall mix towards higher priced specialty pharmaceutical products offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates as described above 
on a pro forma basis  our mail service generic dispensing rate was in  compared to a mail service generic dispensing rate of in on a pro forma basis  revenues from retail claims increased approximately million  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this increase resulted from an increase in retail claim volume of approximately and an increase in average revenue per retail claim of approximately 
the retail claim volume increases were related to increases from new customers offset by the mail penetration rate increase referred to above 
the increase in average revenue per retail claim reflected increases in the prices of products dispensed offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates and the contract change described above 
on a pro forma basis  our retail generic dispensing rate was in  compared to a retail generic dispensing rate of in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased approximately billion to approximately billion in the year ended december   from approximately billion in on a pro forma basis  drug ingredient costs increased approximately billion  or  to approximately billion in from approximately billion in this increase resulted from an increase in total claim volume of approximately and an increase in average drug ingredient cost per claim of approximately 
the total claim volume increases were related primarily to increases from new customers 
the increase in average drug ingredient cost per claim reflected increases in the prices of products dispensed as well as a slight change in overall mix towards higher priced specialty pharmaceutical products offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates and the contract change described above 
generic drugs have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers and generally a higher gross profit margin for the company 
pro forma cost of revenues for the year ended december   were reduced by approximately billion from amounts recorded in the same period in due to the contract change referred to above 
the rate of increase in pro forma drug ingredient costs was also favorably impacted by economies of scale achieved through the combined purchasing efficiency of caremark and advancepcs 
pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues increased by approximately million  or  on a pro forma basis to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase related primarily to additional customer service center and pharmacy costs incurred to service the overall increases in call volumes and mail service claims in from levels experienced in pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the decrease in pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues in relation to revenues primarily reflected the realization of efficiency increases in our mail service pharmacies and customer service centers gained from capacity additions and technological enhancements made through a significant component of the increase in depreciation expense described below related to capital assets purchased in conjunction with the capacity additions and technological enhancements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis in  due primarily to the advancepcs acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by on an absolute basis 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue  to from  reflecting primarily the impact of the cost reductions achieved to date from the advancepcs acquisition 
depreciation 
depreciation increased in due primarily to the advancepcs acquisition 
depreciation increased in on a pro forma basis due primarily to the amounts and timing of depreciation related to capital expenditures made to increase capacities in our mail service pharmacies 
amortization of intangible assets 
the amortization of intangible assets recorded in was related entirely to the intangible assets acquired from advancepcs 
interest income expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted primarily from reductions in the amount of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements and increased interest income generated by cash on hand and short term investments 
stock option expense 
the stock option expense recorded in related to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options held by advancepcs optionees on the date of the advancepcs acquisition 
integration and other related expenses 
we incurred approximately million of integration and other related expenses for the year ended december   as previously described  compared to million in costs incurred in consisted primarily of pre acquisition integration planning activities with respect to the advancepcs acquisition and relocation expenses for moving our corporate headquarters to nashville  tennessee 
provision for income taxes 
as a result of the advancepcs acquisition  our provision for income taxes was recorded using a effective tax rate on book income beginning in the second quarter of compared to the effective tax rate on book income in and the first quarter of historical liquidity and capital resources general 
we broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing to meet our business objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
the following tables set forth selected information concerning our liquidity and capital resources and changes therein at and for the year ended december  dollars in millions net cash and cash equivalents provided by used in continuing operations investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents december  cash and cash equivalents december  december  december  net working capital long term debt fixed rate debt availability under revolving credit facility working capital equals total current assets minus total current liabilities 
the december  net working capital and fixed rate long term debt amounts reflect the classification of million of our senior notes due as long term debt due to our ability to refinance this amount on a long term basis 
the amount classified as long term debt is limited to the availability under our revolving credit facility  and the remaining million of our senior notes due is classified as a current liability 
the december  net working capital and fixed rate long term debt amounts reflect the repayment of the million then outstanding balance of our term loan facility on february  and the repurchase of our remaining outstanding advancepcs senior notes  at of face value  on april  cash flows from continuing operations 
our cash flows from continuing operations of  million for the year ended december   significantly exceeded our net income of million 
the primary reasons for this difference  in addition to ordinary fluctuations in non cash working capital  are i the million difference in the amount of cash taxes paid million and the amount of tax provision recorded during the period million offset by ii our payment of million to settle disputed claims with the federal government as further described in item  legal proceedings 
the amounts of cash taxes we paid through december   have been significantly reduced by our utilization of nols as previously described 
we expect the amount of cash taxes we pay in future periods to more closely approximate the provision for income taxes that we record in our statements of income than it has in previous periods 
the net increase in non cash working capital affecting cash flows from continuing operations from december  to december  also includes the effect of the timing of certain payments in related to transactions that generated cash receipts in  primarily related to the advancepcs acquisition 
for many of the customer contracts we assumed in the advancepcs acquisition  discount payments to customers are based on the discounts that we have collected from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
accordingly  during  we made payments to these customers for their portions of manufacturer discounts that were collected in in addition  cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by approximately million during due to the termination of certain client contracts which had significant levels of retail claims 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily include million invested in available for sale securities and million of capital expenditures  offset by proceeds of million from the sale of our retained interest in a previously disposed subsidiary 
cash flows from financing activities 
in february  we repaid the entire million balance then outstanding under our term loan facility  and in april  we repaid the million remaining outstanding advancepcs senior notes 
we also made payments of approximately million to repurchase million shares of our common stock during the year ended december  these payments were offset by net proceeds of approximately million from issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  including exercises of stock options 
credit facility 
we have a credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent that currently consists of a million revolving credit facility which matures on march  we repaid the million then outstanding balance of the million term loan component of our bank credit facility in february this repayment had no impact on availability under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility  exclusive of approximately million reserved under letters of credit 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and contains restrictive covenants 
the guarantees and covenants applicable to the credit facility are described in further detail in note  long term debt  derivative financial instrument and interest rate risk management  to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
receivables backed credit facility 
we had a million revolving trade receivables sales facility which expired on march  there were no amounts outstanding under this facility in senior notes 
our senior notes are in an aggregate principal amount of million and bear interest at annually  with all principal amounts due in october the indenture for the senior notes contains  among other things  restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness  sale and leaseback transactions and consolidation  merger and sale of assets 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by any subsidiary 
the indenture for the senior notes also contains restrictions on indebtedness secured by liens 
to comply with this covenant  we have secured the senior notes on an equal and ratable basis with the credit facility 
advancepcs senior notes 
we repurchased the then remaining outstanding advancepcs senior notes at of face value on april  outlook liquidity and capital resources overview 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from i commitments related to financing obtained through the issuance of long term debt  ii working capital requirements and iii capital expenditures 
additionally  we have acquired businesses recently  may continue to acquire additional businesses in the future  and could fund any such acquisition using cash on hand and short term investments  availability under our revolving credit facility  or a combination thereof 
we believe that our cash on hand  short term investments  cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
stock repurchase program 
we are authorized to repurchase up to billion of our common stock on the open market under our previously announced repurchase program and subsequent amendments 
repurchases under the program will occur at times and in amounts that management deems appropriate  and we have repurchased approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately billion under this program through february  additional details for repurchases under our stock repurchase program appear at part ii item derivative financial instrument 
we plan to issue year fixed rate debt in the second half of to replace our million principal amount senior notes  which mature in october in june  we entered into a treasury lock agreement for the purpose of eliminating the variability in future interest payments on the planned issuance of year fixed rate debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rate that may occur between the execution date of the agreement and the pricing date of the fixed rate debt 
the treasury lock agreement is based on a year us treasury note with an aggregate principal balance of million 
we have designated the treasury lock agreement as a cash flow hedge  and have recorded the fair value of the agreement in prepaid expenses and other current assets with a corresponding offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the agreement  which represents both the present value of future cash flows and the amount we would receive if the agreement were terminated  was approximately million as of december  the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged forecasted transaction are the same  and we had no ineffectiveness with regard to the agreement 
the ultimate effective gain or loss on the agreement will be recognized over the term of the debt as a component of the total interest expense related to interest payments on the debt issuance 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments continuing operations 
we have various contractual obligations and or commercial commitments arising from both our continuing and discontinued operations 
these obligations and commitments are more fully described in this annual report on form k under various headings in md a as well as in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to our continuing operations at december  in millions payments due under contractual obligations total after long term debt letters of credit long term debt senior notes operating leases see historical liquidity and capital resources credit facility and financial statement note  long term debt  derivative financial instrument and interest rate risk management

see discontinued operations  including off balance sheet guarantees for information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments related to our discontinued operations 
planned capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures for to total approximately million 
this amount could vary significantly depending on the timing of projects and related expenditures 
discontinued operations  including off balance sheet guarantees 
future cash needed to fund the remaining liabilities of discontinued operations and estimated exit costs was estimated to be approximately million  in aggregate  at december   consisting primarily of accruals for real estate leases and legal disputes 
we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising from our discontinued operations 
these primarily include obligations under various leases for commercial real estate 
these leases had aggregate remaining rental payments  net of amounts to be paid to us under subleases  of approximately million at december   due as follows million  million  million and after million 
additionally  we are named as guarantor or obligor on additional discontinued operations real estate leases which we assigned to third parties 
the aggregate amount of these guarantees totaled approximately million at december   and expire as follows million  million  million and after million 
deferred income taxes 
we previously had significant federal income tax nol carryforwards that were primarily generated from losses incurred in our discontinued ppm business 
during the year ended december   we generated sufficient taxable income to utilize our remaining federal income tax nol carryforward  except for a portion of the amount which was acquired through the advancepcs acquisition 
as previously described  the amounts of cash taxes we paid through december   have been significantly reduced by our utilization of nols 
we expect the amount of cash taxes we pay in future periods to more closely approximate the provision for income taxes that we record in our statements of income than it has in previous periods 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fas r  a revision of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment fas 
fas r requires companies to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options as an expense in their financial statements  as opposed to the footnote only pro forma disclosure requirements contained in fas companies may continue the fas pro forma disclosures through the required effective date of adoption of fas r 
in april  the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of fas r to january   for most public companies  including us 
under the transition provisions of fas r  options currently being reflected in the fas pro forma disclosures will be expensed over their remaining vesting periods as of the date of adoption of fas r using the valuation assumptions and methods previously used to prepare the pro forma disclosures 
the estimated grant date fair value of any new stock option grants made after fas r is adopted will be expensed over the vesting periods of the underlying stock option 
additionally  fas r changes the accounting for many equity instruments other than stock options that may be issued to employees under our various benefit plans 
a portion of future transactions under our employee stock purchase plan espp  as currently structured  would result in compensation expense after adoption of fas r  and instruments such as the restricted stock or stock units which may be issued under our stock incentive plan would be impacted as well 
fas r also changes the statement of cash flows classification of tax benefits received for the amount of income tax deductions taken for option exercises in excess of amounts expensed thereunder 
these amounts are currently classified in cash flows from operating activities  however  they will be classified as cash flows from financing activities after adoption of fas r 
the payroll taxes we pay related to stock option exercises will remain classified as cash flows from operating activities 
we expect the adoption of fas r on january  to result in additional stock option expense of approximately million during for the majority of our options outstanding at december   for which we currently record no expense 
in addition  our espp  as currently structured  is expected to generate expense of approximately million under fas r  and the advancepcs replacement options will continue to be expensed over their remaining vesting periods and are expected to generate expense of approximately million in we expect total expense under fas r to be approximately million in  excluding income tax benefit and the impact of any stock option grants 
based on our prior stock option grant practices  we would expect to record approximately million to million of expense in for options granted in we do not expect the adoption of fas r in to have a material effect on our financial position or cash flows excluding the classification impact on the statement of cash flows discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and the fair value of our fixed rate debt are subject to change as a result of movements in market interest rates 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value and future cash flows associated with our treasury lock agreement  described below 
we plan to issue year fixed rate debt in the second half of to replace our million principal amount senior notes  which mature in october in june  we entered into a treasury lock agreement for the purpose of eliminating the variability in future interest payments on the planned issuance of year fixed rate debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rate that may occur between the execution date of the agreement and the pricing date of the fixed rate debt 
the treasury lock agreement is based on a year us treasury note with an interest rate of approximately and an aggregate principal balance of million 
the fair value of the agreement  which represents both the present value of future cash flows and the amount we would receive if the agreement were terminated  was approximately million as of december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of  or approximately basis points  from the rate at december   would result in a decrease in the fair value of the agreement of approximately million as of december  the fair value of the agreement was approximately million as of january
