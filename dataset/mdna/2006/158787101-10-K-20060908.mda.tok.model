our franchisees licensees could take actions that could harm our business franchisees licensees are independent operators and are not employed by us 
we provide training and support to franchisees licensees  but any number of factors beyond our control may diminish the quality of franchised licensed restaurant operations 
consequently  franchisees licensees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel 
if franchisees licensees do not operate in accordance with our standards  our image and reputation may suffer materially and system wide sales could significantly decline 
also  the presence of franchised licensed restaurants may limit our ability to expand in a desired market through company owned restaurants 

table of contents our operations are susceptible to changes in food availability and costs  which could adversely affect our operating results our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national distributor  as the primary supplier of our food 
any increase in distribution prices or failure of sysco to perform could cause our food costs to increase 
there also could be a significant short term disruption in our supply chain if sysco failed to meet our distribution requirements or our relationship was terminated 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  governmental regulation  production  availability and seasonality may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results of operations our success depends  in part  upon the popularity of the menu items served in the champps environment and our dining style 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially and adversely affect our future profitability 
in addition  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
health concerns relating to the consumption of our food products could negatively impact our results of operations we are subject to the risk that consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of particular food products or outbreaks of disease in a food product  such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy ie mad cow disease or avian influenza 
beef and chicken are the key ingredients in many of our menu items 
negative publicity concerning food quality  illness and injury  publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us  or other dietary and health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants 
increases in utility  insurance or other costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our restaurants operating margins are affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as natural gas  electricity and water 
the premiums that we pay for our insurance programs  including workers compensation  general liability  health and directors and officers liability  may increase at any time as may the amount we pay for claims experienced under our high deductible programs 
also  our restaurants incur a number of other costs in order to operate not limited to supplies  services  banking credit card fees and repair and maintenance costs 
all of such costs may increase at any time and negatively affect our operating margins 

table of contents we depend on the services of key executives and management  the loss of whom could materially harm our business our future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our executive officers and key employees  such as regional directors of operation  restaurant general managers and kitchen managers 
competition for these key employees is intense 
the loss of the services of members of our senior management and key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could adversely harm our business until suitable replacements can be found 
litigation or assessments could have a material adverse affect on our business we are subject to complaints or allegations from current and former or prospective employees from time to time 
in addition  we are subject to complaints or litigation from guests alleging discrimination  illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid  whether we are liable  or whether such allegations involve one of our franchisees or licensees 
a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision that could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are also subject to state dram shop laws and regulations  which generally provide that a person injured by an intoxicated person may seek to recover damages from an establishment that illegally over served alcohol to such person 
while we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance  we may still be subject to a judgment in excess of our insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain or continue to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs  or at all 
in connection with the spin off of daka in late  we assumed certain contingent liabilities of daka and its subsidiary  daka  inc daka 
under our post closing covenant agreement with daka  we are responsible for certain resulting liabilities and handling the defense of these claims  including the appeals  which have previously been significant 
from time to time  champps and its predecessors have been party to various assessments of taxes  penalties and interest from federal  state and local agencies 
we provide reserves in our financial statements for these and other matters 
the approximate amounts of these reserves are reviewed periodically to determine their adequacy 
although we believe that our current reserves are adequate in light of our analyses of the potential outcomes of the matters  there can be no guarantees that we will not have to recognize additional charges as these matters are ultimately resolved 
any resulting charges could be significant 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  it could reduce our ability to capitalize on our brand names pursuant to a master agreement dated february   we acquired the champps  champ s and champps americana service marks  trademarks and trade names 
our business prospects depend  in part  on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of the champps name and logo 
our trademarks could be infringed in ways that leave us without redress  such as by imitation 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  and we employ various methods to protect our concepts and recipes 
however  such methods may not afford adequate protection and others could independently develop similar know how or obtain access to our know how  concepts and recipes 
from time to time  we pursue litigation to protect our name and logo  which can be costly and  if unsuccessful  could impair 
table of contents our rights 
moreover  we may face claims of infringement that could both interfere with our use of our proprietary know how  concepts  recipes  trade secrets or trademarks or subject us to damages 
defending against such claims may be costly and  if unsuccessful  may prevent us from continuing to use such proprietary information in the future 
although champps  champ s and champps americana are federally registered trademarks  there are other restaurants and bars that operate under similar names 
if these restaurants or bars are affected by negative publicity and consumers confuse these competitors with our champps branded restaurants  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulations including  but not limited to  the sale and serving of alcoholic beverages and wages paid to our employees that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to expand and develop our restaurants the restaurant industry is subject to various federal  state and local governmental regulations 
while at this time we have been able to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental licenses  permits and approvals  the failure to maintain these licenses  permits and approvals  including food and liquor licenses  could adversely affect our operating results 
difficulties or failure in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants 
local authorities may suspend  revoke or deny renewal of our food and liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct or facilities do not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations 
smoking bans in some locations could also have an adverse effect on our business 
for fiscal  approximately of our restaurant food and beverage sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages  and we believe our ability to serve these beverages is an important factor in attracting guests 
alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and  in certain locations  county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on sundays 
typically  licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time  which could include sales to minors or intoxicated persons 
alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants 
the failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain liquor or food service licenses would adversely affect the restaurant s operations 
various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect our operating costs 
these laws include minimum wage requirements  overtime pay  unemployment tax rates  workers compensation rates  and citizenship requirements 
additional government imposed increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leave of absence and mandated health benefits  increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements could harm our operating results 
we are also subject to the ada which may increase the cost of construction or remodeling 
on june   the united states supreme court ruled that the internal revenue service irs can use aggregate tip estimates to ensure that the employer is paying fica taxes on allegedly underreported tips 
under the ruling  the irs does not need to examine individual employees records and it is permissible for the irs to estimate the amount of cash tips given to employees based on tips included on credit card receipts 

table of contents the reporting of tips is the responsibility of the employees receiving the tips 
we encourage and train our employees to abide by the law and report of the tips that they receive 
while we believe our employees adequately report tips  we have implemented tip reporting policies and procedures that are in full compliance with the recommended irs policies and procedures as defined in our tip reporting alternative commitment agreement that was executed by the company and the irs in fiscal we may not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize our income tax operating loss and credit carryforwards as of july   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and fica tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal nol s expire at various times through and the fica tip tax credits expire at various times through also as of july   we had certain state net operating loss carryforwards totaling million expiring at various dates through while we expect to fully utilize all of the federal carryforwards and the state carryforwards to reduce our income tax liabilities  future income may not be sufficient for full utilization of the carryforwards 
our financial results are subject to fluctuations due to the seasonal nature of our business our sales fluctuate seasonally and therefore our quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
for fiscal years and  our relative sales were highest in our second quarter october through december  followed by our third quarter january through march  then by our first quarter july through september 
our fourth quarter april through june recorded the lowest relative sales for those years 
factors influencing sales variability in addition to those noted above include the frequency and popularity  or lack thereof  of sporting events  holidays including which day of the week the holiday occurs and weather 
we may be locked into long term and non cancelable leases that we want to cancel  and may be unable to renew leases that we want to extend at the end of their terms most of our current leases are non cancelable and typically have terms ranging from to years and renewal options for terms ranging from five to years 
leases that we enter into in the future likely will also be long term and non cancelable and have similar renewal options 
we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease if we close restaurants  which would include  among other things  payment of rents for the balance of the lease terms 
additionally  the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels 
as a result  ongoing operations at underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations 
in addition  at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant  we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost  if at all 
as a result  we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant  which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to repay or refinance our indebtedness our long term debt is principally comprised of a million face value issuance of convertible notes due december the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
we may redeem some or all of the notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
there are no assurances that the convertible debt holders will convert their debt into shares prior to december  nor are there any assurances that the stock price will rise  allowing us to convert the debt 
if the debt is not converted it may be necessary for us to seek additional financing when this debt matures 
if we seek additional financing there are no assurances that we will be able to do so at that time  and the terms of the debt may not be as favorable as our existing debt 
our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and to have our registered independent accounting firm attest to such evaluation 
we have devoted significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so in the future  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our internal controls will be adequate in the future 
if we fail to timely complete our future internal controls evaluations  or if our registered independent accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause us to fail to satisfy our public reporting requirements 
if certain of our restaurants fail to perform to a level sufficient to cover their asset value  we may be forced to incur further write downs of our assets  which could negatively impact our financial performance based on our evaluation of the estimated fair values of impaired assets of our underperforming restaurants we recorded asset impairment charges of million covering three restaurants and million covering four restaurants during fiscal and fiscal  respectively additionally  we have two additional restaurants open for at least six quarters which had positive or approximately break even cash flow over the last twelve months  but the level of such cash flows were not high enough to sufficiently cover the restaurants long term asset values if such cash flows continue for the remainder of the restaurants lives 
as of july   the long lived asset value of these two restaurants was million 
we have not recorded an impairment charge at this time for these restaurants because management believes that each of these restaurants has the opportunity to improve their cash flows to a level sufficient to cover their asset value once external factors impacting their sales are properly addressed 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not experience circumstances in the future that require us to write down additional assets of these or other restaurants 
million and million of asset impairment charges in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were recorded as discontinued operations

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a restaurant company competing in the upscale casual dining market 
as of july   we owned and operated restaurants and franchised licensed restaurants under one of the following names champps americana  champps restaurant or champps restaurant and bar 
we operate and franchise license restaurants in states with larger concentrations of restaurants in the upper midwest  mid atlantic and texas 
champps menu consists of high quality ingredients  freshly prepared and served with exceptional service in an exciting environment through the use of videos  music  sports and promotions 
our restaurants generally are open seven days a week from am to am we serve our guests in the dining room and bar area during lunch  after work  during dinner and after dinner during our late night period 

table of contents the first champps opened in at june  we owned restaurants 
we opened seven restaurants in each of our fiscal years and in fiscal  we opened four additional locations 
we opened one company owned restaurant in fiscal also  a licensee joint venture restaurant of which we own an eight percent equity interest opened in the dallas fort worth airport in october our growth in fiscal was purposely modest as we concentrated on certain initiatives outlined below aimed at improving our existing operations and redefining our growth plans and site selection criteria 
in may  we closed three underperforming restaurants 
financial results related to these three restaurants have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
the closures follow our january announcement that as many as five restaurants were being considered for closure 
decisions regarding the remaining two locations have not been made 
the ultimate decision on whether or not to close restaurants will depend on various factors including  without limitation  reaching mutually acceptable closure or lease concession arrangements with the landlords  assessing the alternatives of operating or subleasing to third parties  analyzing the improvement or further deterioration in revenues or profitability  and reviewing various other financial and operational considerations 
our current restaurants range in size from approximately  square feet to  square feet  with an average of about  square feet 
we have built smaller restaurants starting in fiscal  averaging approximately  square feet 
pre opening expenses have historically averaged approximately  per restaurant but may increase in the future because of the new accounting requirement requiring expensing of rents during the construction period 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity for funding our operations and expansion have been cash provided from operations  and standard restaurant financing methods  such as build to suit transactions  sale leaseback transactions  mortgage facilities  notes payable  tenant improvement allowances and equipment financing 
also  in we issued million of convertible subordinated notes and warrants and in we secured a three year million revolving bank credit facility 
as of july   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility 
key factors that can be used in evaluating and understanding our restaurants and assessing our business include the following comparable sales or same store sales this indicator compares the revenue performance of our restaurants open for more than full months to the same restaurants in the prior year thereby eliminating the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing stores 
small changes in comparable sales can have a proportionally higher impact on operating margins because of the high degree of fixed costs associated with operating restaurants 
average unit volumes a per store average sales amount 
this indicator helps us assess the changes in customer traffic  pricing and impact of adding different sized restaurants 
store operating margin restaurant sales less restaurant level operating costs product costs  labor costs  other operating expenses and occupancy 
we review store operating margins both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of restaurant sales 

table of contents our results  and the results of the restaurant industry as a whole  may be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes  discretionary spending priorities  national  regional and local economic conditions  demographic trends  consumer confidence in the economy  traffic patterns  weather conditions  employee availability  state and federal minimum wage requirements and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
our operating margins are also susceptible to fluctuations in prices of food commodities  costs associated with delivering the products to our stores and other operating necessities such as natural gas and other utility supplies 
the timing of revenues and expenses associated with opening new restaurants is also expected to result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results 
changes in any of these factors could adversely affect us and our financial results 
our comparable sales trends have been negative for eight consecutive quarters after being modestly positive for fiscal year we believe that certain site selection factors may have contributed to the lower sales  as well as  other external factors such as the nhl hockey strike for the entire nhl season and economic factors affecting consumer spending 
our average weekly sales per restaurant have also been decreasing over the last several years as our new stores have lower average weekly sales than our existing stores due in part to their reduced size 
however  the average sales per square foot for our newer stores have been substantially lower than those of our more established locations 
we believe this is due largely to certain underperforming sites selected over the past several years 
we are in the process of implementing a new site selection process which will incorporate an improved analytical evaluation  which we believe will lead to more attractive restaurant results 
from a store operating margin perspective  we have generally been successful in lowering our product costs and labor costs over the past several years  however  other operating expenses and occupancy have increased as a percent of restaurant sales primarily due to the fixed nature of these costs over lower average sales volumes for our restaurants 
rising costs coupled with negative comparable sales have also contributed to the decrease in operating margin 
in fiscal  we experienced significantly higher utility costs with average store utility costs increasing compared to fiscal minimum wage increases have occurred in both this and last fiscal year in a number of states where we operate 
while most of our kitchen staff are paid in excess of minimum wage levels and would typically not be affected by the increases  our server and bar staff are generally paid the tipped minimum wage and we generally must pay a higher hourly wage to those individuals as a result of the state mandated minimum wage increases 
over this last fiscal year  we have been working on certain key strategic initiatives 
we believe we made significant progress in many of these areas  but our goal of reversing our negative comparable sales trends and ultimately improving our long term profitability has not yet materialized 
we believe that our efforts have been hampered by macroeconomic factors which  in the second half of our fiscal year  were generally believed to negatively impact sales of many companies in the full service casual segment of the restaurant industry 
these macroeconomic factors include higher gas prices  higher interest rates and lower consumer confidence 
we plan to continue to pursue our key strategic initiatives and enhancements thereto  described below  as we believe our goals will ultimately be achieved through the initiatives 

table of contents menu changes our main goal has been to renew the focus of the menu on popular  memorable and craveable items favored by our customers 
we have been and plan to continue revising and improving our menu 
the menu changes are intended to allow for better execution  increased quality of our items and ultimately  greater guest satisfaction 
improving our consistency of execution will be a key focus to improve guest satisfaction over the next year 
also  we revamped our specials program in fiscal our specials have been developed with the assistance of outside culinary experts and are now featured more prominently within our menu utilizing a full color layout 
the specials are also being rotated less frequently than in past years to build consumer trial and improve operational execution 
we have seen an increase in our menu mix associated with specials as a result of these efforts 
menu pricing was also examined and adjusted in fiscal while we did not significantly increase overall menu prices  we instituted a tiered group approach to pricing within our restaurants based on analysis of consumer sensitivities to pricing levels within the individual restaurants 
the intent of this revised pricing structure was to take advantage of pricing opportunities without compromising consumer volumes 
we expect to continue to explore these types of pricing opportunities in fiscal validation and training programs in the first half of the year  we recertified and validated all of our restaurant managers 
in fiscal  we also targeted certain training toward our hourly employees 
this continuous improvement effort is aimed at improving our systems and developing our people and culture while creating a heightened awareness of champps mission of offering exceptional food and hospitality to our customers 
heightened and enhanced training will be a key focus for us in fiscal we plan to revamp a number of our training programs including use of new training tools and techniques and also provide leadership development programs for select individuals 
we recently completed a visioneering process to define and communicate our foundational ideas  principles and stakeholder commitments with the help of a consultant who pioneered the process 
the visioneering program is intended to be rolled out system wide in fiscal bar reinvigoration for several years prior to fiscal  our alcohol sales had declined as a percentage of overall revenues 
in fiscal  we reversed this trend and approximately of our restaurant food and beverage sales was attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages  which is one of the highest alcohol sales in the upscale casual dining market 
our goal has been to attract new customers to our bars by improving service levels  ingredient quality and drink presentation 
actions to accomplish this in fiscal included implementing a training program aimed at improving customer service levels  updating or replacing draft beer systems  and adding freezers in all of our restaurants for chilling beer mugs 
we also reworked many of our recipes and drink mixes and developed new specialty drinks for promotions 
prices were adjusted based on competitive considerations and we modified happy hour programs in a number of stores to enhance the guest experience 

table of contents revised general manager bonus plan in  we implemented a more aggressive and performance based bonus plan for our managers focused on monthly unit level cash flow 
we believe this plan provides our restaurant managers with greater performance based compensation and an increased sense of accountability and ownership in each restaurant s success 
this bonus plan has been further enhanced by creating cash flow arrangements under which selected general managers and directors of operation may purchase an enhanced cash flow interest in the restaurants they operate 
as of july   seven of our general managers and two of our directors of operations had executed such agreements 
we expect to continue to offer this opportunity to a number of other general and district managers in fiscal real estate strategy while we do not expect to open any new restaurants in fiscal  our site selection process has been upgraded to include more rigorous evaluation of the success factors for new site development to allow us to achieve our expected investment returns on renewed future growth 
to aid in this process  a multi factor  risk analysis regression software model has been developed with an outside consultant aimed at accurately predicting sales levels and decreasing the risks of opening new restaurants 
we expect to resume opening new restaurants in fiscal also  as part of our real estate strategy  we closed three underperforming restaurants in may and have identified two additional restaurants for possible closure in the next fiscal year 
we also plan to actively monitor and evaluate our restaurant portfolio on an ongoing basis to determine if any further closures are warranted 
franchise network development we value franchising as a potentially profitable function but we purposely did not actively pursue this initiative in fiscal as we viewed the other initiatives as important precursors to our franchising efforts 
we expect to start pursuing a cohesive franchising program in fiscal in addition to the initiatives outlined above  we plan to increase our marketing efforts and expenditures in early fiscal  specifically testing radio promotions in two markets 
our financial results for fiscal ended july  included consolidated revenues decreased by to million reflective of the decreased comparable store sales of  the extra week in fiscal offset by the inclusion of full year results in from four restaurants opened in fiscal income before income taxes of million was recorded in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
included in fiscal s and s results were asset impairment charges and restaurant closings disposals of million and million  respectively 
a loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million was recorded in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  relates to the operations of three locations which were closed in may and related asset impairment charges and restaurant closing disposal costs 
a net loss of million  or diluted loss per share  was reported in fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or diluted loss per share  in fiscal at july   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  reflecting a net increase of million for fiscal

loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in discontinued operations was primarily due to a million pre tax asset impairment charge related to two of the restaurants that ultimately closed in may 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of july   our cash balance was million  which reflects a million increase during the fiscal year 
our net working capital increased by million in fiscal our cash balance and net working capital increased primarily as a result of reduced capital expenditures and receipt of tenant improvement allowances of million 
however  our cash balance and working capital needs are generally low  as sales are made for cash or through credit cards that are quickly converted to cash  purchases of food and supplies and other operating expenses are generally paid within to days after receipt of invoices and labor costs are paid bi weekly 
the timing of our sales collections and vendor and labor payments are consistent with other companies in the restaurant industry 
for fiscal years  and  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow from operations from compared to was primarily due to reduced profitability  costs associated with store closures and lease terminations  and reduced proceeds from tenant improvement allowances 
the decreased cash flow from operations in versus was primarily due to decreased cash from working capital changes and reduced proceeds from tenant improvement allowances 
proceeds from tenant improvement allowances in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  contributed significantly to cash flow from operating activities 
tenant improvement allowances are reimbursements received from certain of our landlords for a portion of initial construction expenditures 
our operating cash flow is enhanced by our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits to offset our federal income tax liability 
at july   we had million of such carryforwards and million of credits available through to offset federal taxes 
we expect to fully utilize these carryforwards and credits in the next seven to ten years 
historically  a significant portion of our cash flow generated from operating activities has been invested in capital expenditures  the majority of which was for the construction of new restaurants 
however  we significantly reduced our new location growth in fiscal we opened only one new restaurant in fiscal  the capital expenditures of which were mostly incurred in the prior year 
we opened four new restaurants in fiscal the following table  in thousands  details our capital expenditures 
fiscal year ended july  july  june  new store construction existing store remodel and refurbishment corporate related capital expenditures purchase of equipment previously under operating lease purchase of property and equipment we expect to spend from million to million for capital expenditures for fiscal these expenditures will primarily be for upgrades to existing restaurants but are expected to include expenditures for new restaurants expected to open in fiscal we review our capital expenditures budget frequently and amounts are subject to change 

table of contents we have an agreement with aei fund management  inc for development and sale leaseback financing up to million 
at july   we had not completed any restaurants under this commitment and had none under development 
the agreement expires in october and we do not anticipate extending this agreement 
the funding of this build to suit facility is subject to various pre closing conditions 
in fiscal  and  we elected to prepay million  million and million  respectively  of our existing debt to reduce our annual interest costs 
the funds to prepay the debt came from excess cash and borrowings under our million senior bank credit facility described below 
no debt extinguishment costs were recorded with the and prepayments 
prepayment penalties and a write off of unamortized deferred financing fees totaling  were recorded in fiscal as a result of prepaying the debt before its scheduled maturity 
we have a three year million senior secured credit facility  which expires in march we initially used a portion of the facility to refinance certain of our existing debt  and the facility may also be used to support opening new restaurants and general working capital needs and provide up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility is secured by a blanket lien on all of our personal assets and real property 
borrowings under the facility will bear interest depending on a total funded debt to ebitda ratio and can range from the prime rate to prime plus percent or  if elected by us  libor plus to percent 
total funded debt is defined as all indebtedness of the consolidated entities  including senior and subordinated debt  capital lease obligations and contingent liabilities 
we paid an up front fee of  and are required to pay an annual unused commitment fee of to percent 
the credit facility limits the opening of new company owned restaurants to a maximum of twenty four over a three year period of which through july  we have opened six new company owned restaurants and also limits the amount of dividends and or stock repurchases to million over a three year period of which through july   we have repurchased million see stock repurchase plan discussion below 
as of july   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and had placed letters of credit of million under the facility with million available for additional borrowing 
the facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth level and not exceed certain thresholds for total funded debt to ebitda and total senior debt to ebitda ratios

we are currently are in the process of negotiating a new credit facility with our existing lender to replace the facility that expires in march 
table of contents in addition  we have million of principal amount outstanding convertible notes due december the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
at any time on or after december   we may redeem some or all of the notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
there are no assurances that the convertible debt holders will convert their debt into common shares prior to december if the debt is not converted  we expect to either pay the debt off with available cash  proceeds from credit facility borrowings  refinanced term debt  or a combination of these methods 
if we seek additional financing there are no assurances that we will be able to do so at that time  and the terms of the debt may not be as favorable as our existing debt

in january  our board of directors approved and announced a plan to use up to million to repurchase our common stock from time to time over the next two years 
through july   we purchased  shares of common stock for million under this plan 
purchases under the program may be made in the open market or in private transactions 
purchases under the program will depend  among other factors  on the prevailing stock price  market conditions  alternative investment opportunities and are expected to be funded primarily with available cash balances and operating cash flow 
there is no minimum or maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the program 
the repurchased shares will be held in treasury and used for issuance under our equity incentive plans 
we have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock and currently have no plans to do so 
we closed three restaurants in may and are currently evaluating whether to close up to two additional restaurants in connection with lease renegotiations with certain landlords 
we exited one location in june through lease termination at a cost of million 
we purchased one closed location from its landlord for million and we are planning to resell the property 
the other closed location is expected to be disposed of through a sublease or lease termination as we currently still are paying rent for that space 
ultimately  we believe that the net cash cost will be between to million to exit these three locations 
we can not make any assurances that we will either close or keep open the two remaining restaurants currently being evaluated 
during fiscal  we did not incur any costs related to predecessor company matters 
during fiscal and fiscal  we expended approximately million and million  respectively  for settlements and on going legal costs related to the predecessor company matters 
we believe that such costs in fiscal and beyond will not be significant and  if any  will be limited to on going legal costs 
for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies  including our payments associated with our predecessor company activities  please refer to the information provided under note commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe our cash flow from operations  together with funds available under our million credit facility million available at july  or a new credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt repayment  share repurchases  expansion and any additional potential restaurant closure costs at least through the end of calendar year however  changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described previously under forward looking statements and in part i  item a 
risk factors may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed 
table of contents could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate or grow our business 
contractual obligations and commitments payments  including interest  due by period as of july  in s contractual obligations total one year and less two to three years four to five years after five years operating leases long term debt letters of credit royalties we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for our headquarters and all but one of our restaurants 
the fixed terms of the restaurant leases range up to years and generally contain multiple renewal options for various periods ranging from five to years 
the table  as presented above  includes only the non cancelable portion of our leases as we are only obligated for that period 
our restaurant leases also contain provisions that require additional rent payments based on sales performance and the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes 
amounts in this table do not reflect any of these additional amounts 
our long term debt is comprised of a million issuance of convertible notes due december the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
at any time on or after december   we may redeem some or all of the notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
there are no assurances that the convertible debt holders will convert their debt into common shares prior to december  nor are there any assurances that the stock price will rise  allowing us to automatically convert the debt 
if the debt is not converted it may be necessary for us to seek additional financing when this debt matures 
if we seek additional financing there are no assurances that we will be able to do so at that time  and the terms of the debt may not be as favorable as our existing debt 
we have letters of credit outstanding to guarantee performance under insurance contracts and to secure other arrangements 
the letters of credit are irrevocable and have one year renewable terms 
we regularly have commitments under contracts for the purchase of property and equipment and for the construction of buildings under build to suit arrangements or otherwise 
as of july   we did not have any such commitments which were not reflected as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we are obligated to pay a licensing fee for the use of the champ s and champps service marks  trademarks and trade names 
although this agreement runs in perpetuity  under royalties in the schedule above we have presented only years of our obligation 
see trademarks in the business section  part  item of this report 
table of contents impact of inflation over the last three years  we have not operated in a period of high general inflation  although we have experienced material increases in specific commodity costs and utilities 
also  a large number of our restaurant employees are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay property taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we cannot predict whether inflation will have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
seasonality our sales fluctuate seasonally and therefore our quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
for fiscal years and  our relative sales were highest in our second quarter october through december  followed by our third quarter january through march  then by our first quarter july through september 
our fourth quarter april through june recorded the lowest relative sales for those years 
factors influencing sales variability in addition to those noted above include the frequency and popularity of sporting events  holidays including which day of the week the holiday occurs and weather 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed by us to be reasonable under the circumstances 
items significantly impacted by estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  loss contingencies generally related to litigation and assessments  self insured risks relating to workers compensation and general liability claims  the useful lives and recoverability of our long lived assets such as property and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  lease accounting  fair value of stock based compensation including estimating forfeitures  valuation of deferred tax assets and the recording of income tax expense 
loss contingencies and self insurance reserves we maintain accrued liabilities and reserves relating to the resolution of certain contingent obligations and reserves for self insurance 
significant contingencies may include those related to litigation and state tax assessments 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
contingencies which are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the best estimate within that range  if none of the estimates within that range is better than another  we accrue to the low end of the range 

table of contents we are self insured for a significant portion of our employee health benefits  workers compensation and general liability programs 
however  we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our individual claim and total exposures under those programs 
we estimate our accrued liability for the ultimate costs to close known claims  including claims incurred but not yet reported to us as of the balance sheet date 
our recorded estimated liability for self insurance is based on the insurance companies incurred loss estimates and management s judgment  including assumptions and factors related to the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history and our claims settlement practice 
the assessment of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of loss contingencies and self insurance reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our financial statements 
useful lives of property and equipment land  buildings  leasehold improvements and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or reasonably assured lease term for leasehold improvements 
these estimates may produce materially different amounts of reported depreciation and amortization expense if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact our need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
the annualized effect of a one year increase in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment would decrease our depreciation expense by approximately million 
the effect of a one year decrease in the estimated useful lives would increase our depreciation expense by approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and related identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
we separately evaluate each individual restaurant for impairment 
generally  a restaurant is not evaluated for impairment until it has been open a full six quarters  as the initial two quarters of operations are generally characterized by operating inefficiencies associated with start up operations 
however  we may review a restaurant sooner for impairment if it is operating significantly below our expectations or other factors indicate that impairment could be likely 
we consider a total of four trailing quarters of negative cash flow or losses to be an indication that an individual restaurant may be impaired 
in evaluating whether an impairment charge is appropriate  we estimate the future cash flows for such potentially impaired restaurants utilizing such factors as restaurant sales trends  local conditions  demographics and competition  management plans and initiatives and other factors deemed appropriate in the circumstances 

table of contents during the third quarters of fiscal and  we recorded asset impairment charges of million covering three restaurants and million covering four restaurants  respectively  part of which was classified as discontinued operations 
additionally  we have two additional restaurants open for at least six quarters which had positive or approximately break even cash flow over the last twelve months  but the level of such cash flows were not high enough to sufficiently cover the restaurants long term asset values if such cash flows continue for the remainder of the restaurants lives 
as of july   the long lived asset value of these two restaurants was million 
we have not recorded an impairment charge at this time for these restaurants because management believes certain plans can be implemented to improve the future prospects of those restaurants 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill and other unidentifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we are required to assess impairment at least annually by means of a fair value based test 
at july   we evaluated our goodwill and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates related to our business and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimate 
leases we lease most of our properties including our corporate office 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 both entitled accounting for leases  as well as other subsequent amendments and authoritative literature 
to classify the lease as either an operating or a capital lease we use the non cancelable term of the lease if there is no penalty to cancel the lease at the conclusion of the non cancelable period 
if a penalty exists  we use the non cancelable period plus option s in determining the term to use when classifying the lease 
a penalty is deemed to occur if we would forego an economic benefit  or suffer an economic detriment by not renewing the lease 
this penalty can either be pursuant to the lease provisions or can arise from the retirement of an asset with value 
this same lease term is used to calculate straight line rent and in calculating depreciation expense for our leasehold improvements 
we record the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and record the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments tenant improvement allowances received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
the fasb has announced its intention to review lease accounting standards and future authoritative changes to the methods of accounting for leases could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options and restricted stock awards to certain employees and non employee directors 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying value for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes
