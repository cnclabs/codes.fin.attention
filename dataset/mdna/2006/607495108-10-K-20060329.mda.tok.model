item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of many factors including those under the caption forward looking information in item overview our strategy for returning to growth is continuing to gain market share in the custom folding cartons business and aggressively entering the commercial print market by serving the largest print distributors and internet print providers while capturing direct customers in select markets 
we believe the commercial print industry will continue consolidating and  given our operational expertise to serve multitudes of large orders on a rapid  profitable basis  we can rapidly gain market share 
we believe we can effectively challenge other printer businesses because we offer faster speed  higher variability and flexibility and can capitalize on our superprint facility s economies of scale to offer competitive prices with better margins than those printers whose business models are based on long lead times and large production runs or those lacking the depth in capabilities and sufficient scale to profitably serve such a diverse marketplace 
during the period of through reviewed in the following discussion  our operations have been significantly influenced by the activities associated with our supply agreements with vistaprint limited 
in  we lost vistaprint s business to its decision to produce its print products in house  however  we had stepped up our sales and marketing efforts to expand our existing custom folding carton market and to build new market opportunities for our commercial print products 
we anticipate expenditures for sales and marketing to continue into  however  we anticipate there should be reductions in our sales and marketing spending of approximately million as a result of not having the marketing activities associated with the launch of our web to print store  www

excluding the revenue related to the contract buy out fee  revenue was million compared with million in the custom folding cartons product line had sales of million in  up million  or  from million in approximately of this increase came from new customers  while came from higher volumes with existing customers 
commercial print on demand product line sales were down million  or  to million in from million in until the fourth quarter of  commercial print product sales were  for the most part  to vistaprint 
during the first eight months of  mod pac s contract with vistaprint was based on a long term cost recovery approach with the terms of the agreement stretching until april vistaprint was billed for the costs in our plant that were dedicated to their production requirements plus a one third mark up on product fulfillment 
on september   this arrangement was revised to a more traditional customer vendor supply arrangement with the definitive term of the agreement changed to one year  through august  the pricing structure was changed as well to a units based approach 
as a part of the restructuring of the agreement  mod pac received payment of million from visatprint as a buy out fee for the remaining years of the original contract 
this fee was to be amortized over a month period  which was defined by the month definitive term of the new agreement that was effective september  and the month period for which a pricing framework was described in this agreement relative to any subsequent agreements 
on april   mod pac agreed to an amendment of the supply agreement that was effective september   which modified the exclusivity provision regarding the north american market 
as a result of the amendment  vistaprint was allowed to produce and ship product to its north american customers from 
table of contents its windsor  ontario plant prior to august   the expiration of the supply agreement 
in exchange  mod pac received payments that approximated mod pac s fixed costs and mark up on such costs for the actual products vistaprint shipped 
during the period april  through the termination of the supply agreement at august   mod pac received million in payments from vistaprint 
simultaneously  the company executed a supply agreement with vistaprint for the month period ending august  this agreement established unit pricing for volumes above  per month  while for volumes below that threshold  a low volume surcharge was put into place 
vistaprint  however  was not obligated to purchase printed products from mod pac under this agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  given the conclusion that the company does not anticipate any future sales to vistaprint  the remaining million of the unamortized portion of the contract buy out fee was recognized as revenue 
net sales in mod pac s stock box product line remained flat year over year at million  while the personalized print product line realized a slight increase of million in net sales to million in  from million in compared with for fiscal  revenue was million compared with million in  an increase of million or 
commercial print on demand  which had net product sales of million in  accounted for million of this increase

revenue in also included million associated with the amortization of the contract buy out fee from vistaprint 
the custom folding cartons product line had net sales of million  up million  or from million in approximately of this increase came from new customers with the balance of the increase coming from higher volume to existing customers

throughout the majority of this three year period  we have added additional capacity measured both in terms of equipment and production hours available 
in the first half of  two high speed presses were added  and by the second half of  we were generally running three shifts a day 
in  another high speed press was added  while we continued to increase the capabilities of our second and third shifts through increased supervision and production support  such as engineering  material handling  shipping and receiving 
in  additional machinery for finishing was purchased  including a stitchmaster  folder  and cutter that allows us to enlarge our portfolio of commercial print products 
this aggressive ramp up of capacity through the beginning of was undertaken both to successfully service the rapidly growing vistaprint business and to address our strategic effort to aggressively enter the commercial print market 
during the latter half of  capacity was underutilized and pressure was placed on our cost of products sold 
an increase in raw material costs and changing sales mix also contributed to the increase in costs 
the increase in cost of products sold  excluding the amortization of the contract buy out fee  in to of revenue from of revenue in was primarily the result of increased raw material cost  changing sales mix  and investment in resources which supported previous vistaprint business 
with the loss of vistaprint as a customer  the company now has excess capacity  which we plan to use to reestablish growth in the commercial print business 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue in  excluding the amortization of the contract buy out fee  was compared with in the increase was a result of the costs associated with our increased capacity not recovered through volume increases and the effect on revenue related to the change in our billing structure with vistaprint

the increase in from was a result of borrowings to fund the company s capital program 
loss on disposal of assets the loss on sale of assets of thousand in resulted from the sale or disposal of mainly pre press equipment and components  which became redundant as a result of the implementation of more advanced technology 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  in  and in the tax rate was higher than would be customary due to an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to new york state tax credits 
new york state enacted tax legislation resulting in a change to the new york state apportionment methodology 
the enacted legislation will lower the apportionment of the company s taxable income to new york state and should result in lower new york state income taxes 
accordingly  the company s ability to use or realize new york state tax credits was reduced 
as a result  the company increased its valuation allowance reflecting an increase to income tax expense of approximately  in the tax rate was lower than customary due to the company reducing its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as a result of realizing a portion of the deferred tax assets for the state tax credits

liquidity and capital resources in  cash used in operating activities was million  million less than the million in cash generated in this decrease is primarily due to the receipt of the million advance payment from vistaprint in and the million of income taxes paid in related to the receipt of this payment

since the company s spin off from astronics in  our high speed press capacity has increased by with the addition of three large format presses 
in connection with these presses  substantial investment was made in pre press and post press equipment 
during this time  four production lines were added which were based on leading edge digital press technology 
additionally  production  warehouse and office space were expanded at both of our production facilities in western new york 
at the main production facility  a megawatt power plant was installed in that provides a more secure and stable source of electrical power to operate our production equipment than could have been achieved through the local utility 
capital expenditures for are expected to be substantially less and primarily related to maintenance 
the company anticipates up to approximately million in capital spending for the company acquired temporary investments in of million with its extra cash  million of this was used in to pay income taxes above our regular requirements as all of the income taxes associated with the advanced contract buy out fee were paid in the company borrowed million on a term loan facility in the proceeds were used to pay amounts due astronics and to fund capital expenditures

mod pac had a supply agreement with vistaprint limited pursuant to which they were vistaprint limited s exclusive north american supplier of printed products through august  this agreement  which was effective july  set prices on a price per unit basis and provided a framework for pricing products covered by any renewals or extensions through august the unit prices were arrived at by reference to mod pac s fully burdened costs for products subject to the agreement  plus a mark up 
the million buyout fee that vistaprint paid mod pac on august  was negotiated between the two companies 
the buyout fee was primarily associated with providing mod pac cost recovery and profit on the production resources developed or acquired which were dedicated to the fulfillment of vistaprint s business in north america through this agreement replaced a previous supply agreement that extended to  and whereby mod pac charged vistaprint on a cost plus one third mark up basis 
on april   the company agreed to an amendment of the supply agreement with vistaprint  which modified the exclusivity provision regarding the north american market 
as a result  vistaprint was allowed to produce and ship product to its customers in north america from its windsor  ontario plant prior to august   the expiration of the supply agreement  in exchange for payments to mod pac that approximated mod pac s fixed costs and mark up on such costs for the actual products vistaprint ships

recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than january   which is when the company will adopt it 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
statement r allows for prospective adoption methods or restating prior years 
the company intends to apply the prospective method upon adoption 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  no amounts of operating cash flows were recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by this statement clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and waste spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november the company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
in developing such estimates  management evaluates the facts known to it at the time and applies such facts within the framework of certain critical accounting policies that govern valuation allowances of the company s assets 
these policies include determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to doubtful accounts receivable  lower of cost or market reserves related to the company s inventories  depreciation allowances  impairment reserves with respect to the company s long lived assets and valuation allowances with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
often  management must make certain assumptions about the future when applying these policies 
management uses past experience in developing such assumptions about the future 
actual experience will be different than the assumptions made and the differences could result in material adjustments to management s estimates 

table of contents specifically and with respect to deferred tax assets  the company had gross deferred assets at december  of million related to new york state tax credits 
these credits are subject to certain statutory provisions  such as length of available carry forward period and minimum tax  which reduces the probability of realization of the full value of such credits 
management estimates the amount of credits the company is likely to realize in the future based on actual historical realization rates and the statutory carry forward period 
as a result of the analysis performed as of december   management adjusted the valuation allowance for these credits to million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of short cycle times  the company does not have any long term commitments to purchase production raw materials or sell products that would present significant risks due to price fluctuations 
raw paper stock is available to us from multiple domestic sources and  as a result  we believe the risk of supply interruptions due to such things as strikes at the source of supply or to logistics systems are limited 
risks due to fluctuation in interest rates are not material to the company at december   because we have no exposure to floating rate debt and limited market risk on our million of temporary investments because interest is reset to market rates up to every days 
since may of  over of the company s power needs are met through natural gas 
the company has investigated supply contracts of various lengths  currently it has no supply arrangements for fixed prices 
historically  the price of natural gas has fluctuated widely 
in the past months  natural gas prices have been as low as per decatherm and as high as per decatherm  and it is currently trading around per decatherm for april natural gas 
a one dollar per decatherm change in the price of natural gas would affect the company s annual net income by approximately  although the company is concerned about cost  and has from time to time acquired contracts for natural gas  its main concern is availability 
the company monitors the availability of natural gas  considering such factors as amount in storage  gas production data and transportation data  so that it can take appropriate action if concerns about availability occur 
the company has investigated and tested a back up power source in the form of a rented transportable diesel powered generator 
although such generators are generally available  the company cannot be assured that a generator adequate to meet the company s needs would be available if and when such need should arise 
we have no foreign operations  nor do we transact any business in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we have no foreign currency market risks 
the market risk that the company was exposed to at december  was generally the same as described above
