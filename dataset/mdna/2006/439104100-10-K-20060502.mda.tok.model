the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations reflects the above described restatements 
overview hooper holmes  inc and its subsidiaries currently engage in businesses that are managed as two separate divisions the health information division and the claims evaluation division 
our health information division hid provides medical related risk assessment information to life and health insurance carriers  information that is integral to such carriers underwriting decisions 
these services include arranging paramedical and medical examinations of individual insurance policy applicants mainly life insurance policy applicants throughout the united states under the portamedic brand name and in the united kingdom under the medicals direct brand name  performing telephone interviews of applicants and collecting applicants medical records  testing the blood  urine and other specimens obtained in connection with a portion of the paramedical examinations we coordinate  as well as specimens provided by third party health information service providers  and underwriting life insurance policies on an outsourced basis for life insurance companies 
our health information division accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
our core portamedic paramedical examination business accounted for of our hid revenue and of our total revenue in in and  portamedic accounted for and of hid revenues and and of our total revenues  respectively 
our claims evaluation division ced provides medical claims evaluation services to property and casualty p c insurance carriers  law firms  self insureds and third party administrators for use in processing personal injury accident claims 
the core activity of this business consists of arranging for independent medical exams imes 
an ime is a medical examination by a doctor other than a claimant s physician for purposes of rendering an objective opinion regarding the nature  origin  treatment and causal relationship of an injury  typically to establish whether the claimant needs further treatment or is disabled  or to determine what medical expenses are eligible for payment or reimbursement 
we provide our claims evaluation services in connection with automobile particularly no fault  liability  disability and workers compensation claims 
our claims evaluation division accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 

table of contents key factors affecting our businesses our revenue  profitability and cash flows are directly affected by the demand for our services  the prices we can charge for the services we provide  the relative volume of the higher margin services we provide relative to services with lower margins  and our efforts to grow our business and manage our operating and other expenses 
in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the businesses that comprise our health information division and our claims evaluation division have been influenced by several key factors or trends  discussed below 
health information division decline in life insurance application activity the level of life insurance application activity in the united states and in the united kingdom can have  and we believe has had  a significant effect on the businesses that comprise our health information division 
in general  the lower the level of application activity  the lower the demand for our paramedical examination  tele underwriting  lab specimen testing and outsourced underwriting services 
based on data available from the medical information bureau group  inc mib  a clearinghouse of policy application information based in westwood  massachusetts that is owned by participants in the insurance industry  it appears that life insurance application activity in north america has declined during each of the last three years 
the mib life index is the life insurance industry s timeliest measure of application activity across the united states and canada 
the index is based on the number of searches member company underwriters perform on the mib database 
since the vast majority of individually underwritten life insurance premium dollars in north america include a mib search as a routine underwriting requirement  the mib life index provides what our management believes is a reliable proxy for new application activity 
the mib data suggest a decline in application activity of in  in and in the mib data is consistent with a number of fundamental changes that have been occurring within the life insurance industry over a number of years  including the reported shift in consumers preferences away from individual life insurance and toward accumulation and investment products  such as annuities and mutual funds  and the reported significant drop off in the number of insurance agents selling life insurance 
in the latter regard  limra international formerly the life insurance marketing and research association has reported that in more than of american households did not have a personal life insurance agent or broker 
pricing pressure from life insurance carriers for the past several years  we have experienced downward pricing pressure from our life insurance carrier customers 
we attribute this pressure to the carriers efforts to address cost issues in a more rigorous manner in an attempt to maintain their profitability and level of return to their stakeholders in the face of i lower returns in the stock and bond markets  ii a shift in life insurance premium dollars away from higher margin whole life products toward lower margin term life insurance products  and iii the previously mentioned shift in consumers investment preferences toward accumulation and investment products 
as discussed in item business sales and marketing health information division  our core portamedic business must negotiate with the home offices of life insurance carriers to get on their lists of approved outside risk assessment service providers 
in recent years  those negotiations have increasingly focused on pricing levels as carriers have focused on lowering their costs 
we anticipate that life insurance carriers cost containment objectives will serve to increase the level of interest and demand for tele interviewing underwriting and for outsourced underwriting services  both of which we believe further those objectives 
accordingly  we see our businesses that provide those services as having significant growth potential 
at the same time  we recognize that tele interviewing underwriting can reduce the demand for paramedical and lab services due  in part  to the screening out of life insurance applicants at an earlier stage in the medical related information gathering process 

table of contents claims evaluation division contraction of the outsourced claims management market in the united states our management perceives that the outsourced medical claims management market in the united states  including the market for the claims evaluation division s claims evaluation services  may be contracting 
there are a number of factors that may be contributing to this trend  including the decrease in manufacturing employment levels in the united states and the associated decline in the rates of workplace injuries and  in turn  workers compensation claims  the reported decline in the number of people injured in automobile accidents in the united states  and changes in state laws and regulations that  in general  encourage the use of managed care techniques in handling workers compensation and automobile related personal injury insurance claims 
managed care laws generally channel claimants into provider networks and suggest treatment protocols and other constraints on the activity of the physician practitioners in such networks 
in addition to the factors cited above  the market for claims evaluation services in new york where a significant portion of the ced s revenues were derived in the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report has been adversely affected by the implementation of regulatory changes for example  shortening the period of time for filing a personal injury and property claim and efforts to curb auto injury insurance fraud 
increasing customer procurement demands federal laws regarding financial controls and accountability such as the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as the privacy and security of medical records eg  the health information portability and accountability act of and consumer personal financial information the gramm leach bliley act have resulted in stricter compliance standards that property and casualty insurers  third party administrators of claims  and other claim handlers and  as a consequence  their vendors must meet 
we are being asked to complete lengthy questionnaires  provide written representations as to our compliance with applicable laws  and meet more rigorous standards regarding the quality of our services 
enhanced physician credentialing  including the undertaking of criminal background checks of such physicians  is a particularly time consuming and costly demand being made by certain insurance company clients 
in addition  our customers are seeking confirmation that we have the financial wherewithal to sustain legal challenges to our compliance with these laws 
in a still fairly diffuse market  our management believes that the claims evaluation division has benefited and management believes will continue to benefit from the above described increasing customer procurement demands 
we believe that the company s corporate infrastructure and outsourcing capabilities the core strengths that the company sought to leverage when it determined to enter into the claims evaluation business position us well to meet our customers demands arising out of the increasingly stringent regulatory requirements 
write down of long lived assets and goodwill in the fourth quarter of  the company s management initiated our annual testing for impairment of goodwill  in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
we also deemed it appropriate to test for impairment of long lived assets  since certain impairment indicators were present 
during the course of the testing process  we considered a number of events and circumstances that constitute impairment indicators under the literature  including the company s operating loss in the third quarter of  a preliminary expectation of an operating loss in the fourth quarter of  projections of operating results in future periods that reflected an assumption that some of the negative trends adversely affecting each of the company s two divisions discussed above would continue  a decline in the market price of our common stock over a sustained period of time  and 
table of contents upon completion of the impairment tests  we recorded non cash impairment charges to long lived assets and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
for more information regarding these impairment charges  see the discussion under results of operation impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
key financial and other metrics monitored by management in our periodic reports filed with the sec  we provide certain financial information and metrics about our businesses and each of our two segments  information that our management uses in evaluating the company s performance and financial condition 
our objective in providing this information is to help our shareholders and investors generally understand our overall performance and assess the profitability of our businesses and our prospects for future net cash flows 
in  our management primarily focused on tracking our actual results relative to our forecasts and budgets  and measuring the degree of success of efforts to align our costs with lower revenue levels 
with respect to our health information division  our management monitors the following metrics the mib life index data  which  as discussed above  serves as a proxy for the level of life insurance application activity and indirectly serves to give us a sense of changes in our market share  the number of paramedical examinations and screenings performed by portamedic and medicals direct  respectively  the average revenue per paramedical examination  the number of tele interviewing underwriting reports we generate  the number of specimens tested by our heritage labs subsidiary  and the average revenue per specimen tested 
with respect to our claims evaluation division  our management monitors the following metrics the number of incoming cases by client and by insurance adjusters  time of service which measures the time to complete a claim receipt to issuing a report  customer profitability  and budget to actual financial performance with an eye on the divisions cost structure 
certain of the above cited metrics are discussed in the comparative discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows 
results of operations comparative discussion and analysis of results of operations in  and the table below sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations and other data  and certain key statistics  for the periods indicated 

table of contents revenues by component businesses and reporting segments for the years ended december  in millions change restated change restated hid portamedic infolink medicals direct group mdg other total hid ced total revenues we experienced a decline in our total revenues in compared to the prior year 
in contrast  our total revenues were higher than in much of the increase in revenues in was attributable to the acquisitions we completed in to grow our underwriting business maas within the health information division and to grow the claims evaluation division 
as explained below  similar market forces influenced the revenues and operating results of each of our two divisions  and the component businesses within our health information division  throughout the three year period ended december  health information division our portamedic business experienced a decline in revenues of million  or  in compared to the prior year 
this continued the downward trend from the prior year  portamedic s revenues were down compared to the decline in portamedic revenues in each of and reflected a combination of a reduction in the number of paramedical examinations performed  in   in and  in  and a decrease in the average revenue per paramedical examination in  in and in 
we attribute the reduction in the number of paramedical examinations performed during each of and  at least in part  to the apparently lower life insurance application activity as suggested by the mib life index data 
however  the rate of the decline in the number of paramedical examinations performed in each of and exceeded the decline in mib life index in each of those years 
the decline in also reflected the loss of two customers in  customers from which we derived of the health information division s revenues in we believe we lost the business of one customer as a result of events relating to the alleged improper actions of one of our paramedical examiners 
we have more recently entered into agreements with  for us  new life insurance carrier customers whose volumes of business are expected in time to offset the decline in revenues attributable to these two lost customers 
all of the other businesses within our health information division experienced revenue increases in and compared to the immediately preceding year  helping to offset a portion of the decline in portamedic s revenues in those years 
medicals direct group mdg experienced an increase in revenues of million  or in compared to the prior year 
mdg s results in reflect substantial growth in revenues derived by mdg s definitech physician exams business  up over the prior year 
this business represented approximately of mdg s revenues in  
table of contents an increase in revenues derived by mdg s underwriting business  which represented approximately of mdg s revenues in  a decline in mdg s revenues from screenings in  reflecting the reported reduction in the number of life insurance policies underwritten compared to the prior year and the increased competition mdg is facing in the uk market  which our management views as a mature market 
screenings represented of mdg s revenues in  and mdg s revenues vs 
that of the prior year was million vs

the increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year in of the operating results of a screenings business acquired in october  the addition of several new insurance company clients of the outsourced underwriting business  growth organically and through two acquisitions in the medico legal business  and an increase in the pound sterling us dollar exchange rate 
our revenue in from our infolink business aps retrieval and tele interviewing was million  an increase of compared to the prior year

our revenue in from maas outsourced underwriting business increased to million  compared to million in the eight month period of the prior year ie from the time of our acquisition of maas in may 
claims evaluation division our claims evaluation division experienced a decline in revenues in of million  or approximately  compared to the prior year million in vs 
million in and experienced an increase in over of approximately million or 
we attribute the decline in revenues to several factors  including the reported decline in automobile accident related claims activity in the new york market  which management believes may reflect more conservative automobile insurance underwriting standards  the continuing effects of regulatory changes adopted in the mid s that  among other things  require claimants and medical practitioners to notify insurers of potential no fault auto claims on a more timely basis  which has  in turn  resulted in a decline in the number of claims that may be considered for an ime or peer review  and heightened enforcement of insurance fraud laws by the new york state attorney general  the new york state insurance bureau and the district attorney s office and special investigative units of insurance companies  which reduced the need for additional claims evaluation services 
the increase in revenues in over was primarily attributable to the revenue contribution of allegiance health and michigan evaluations group  both of which were acquired in  and revenue contribution of medimax  acquired in october for a full year in cost of operations our total cost of operations amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in the following table shows the cost of operations as a percentage of segment revenues and  in the case of the hid  further broken down by certain of the component businesses during the last three years

the success heritage labs included in other had in in reducing its material costs helped to partially offset the factors contributing to the higher cost of operations as a percentage of the hid s revenues 
in addition  maas was able to better leverage its existing outsourced underwriting cost structure by virtue of the increased revenue generated by maas principal customer 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues for the health information division in compared to was due to the following higher revenue levels derived from infolink tele interviewing and attending physician statements which has a lower gross margin than that of portamedic  costs associated with medicals direct s services provided to the legal profession of million were incurred relating to revenue that is contingent and will be recognized in future periods

the company expects to be able to eliminate duplicative costs and take advantage of synergies within these centers 
claims evaluation division cost of operations for ced totaled million in  compared to million in and million in as a percentage of the segment s revenues  cost of operations represented  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily attributable to lower revenue levels  particularly in the state of new york  high costs associated with revenues administered out of our michigan office for services performed in other states  and increase in non new york state revenues administered by our upper new york state office 
revenues generated outside of new york state have a higher cost of sales as the physicians panel is not as extensive in states outside new york  resulting in a higher cost per evaluation 
the increase in cost of operations as compared to is due to the higher cost of operations from the medimax and allegiance health businesses  acquired in october and january  respectively  relative to d d associates which is able to better leverage its operating expenses by processing of a higher volume of imes 
in january  we merged the four acquired companies  d d associates  medimax  allegiance health and michigan evaluation group into hooper evaluations  inc operationally  allegiance health and medimax merged into d d associates

and statement of financial standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
respectively 
long lived assets under sfas no 
 long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets are to be tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
as discussed in the overview  there were several events and circumstances that constituted impairment indicators in the fourth quarter of accordingly  we initiated an impairment analysis of our long lived assets and determined that the carrying values of some of the long lived assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we calculated the fair values of our long lived assets 
the fair values were determined based on both discounted cash flow and market based methodologies and indicated that an impairment of the company s intangible assets existed 
accordingly during the fourth quarter of the company recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
the million charge consisted of a million impairment of ced intangible assets eg  trade names  customer relationships  non competition agreements and physician networks and a million impairment of hid intangible assets eg  customer relationships and non competition agreements 
the amounts are recorded within impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill under sfas no 
 the impairment test involves determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as would occur in a purchase transaction  treating the fair value of the reporting unit as the equivalent of the purchase price and deducting from that amount  the fair value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit 
the company considered all of the impairment indicators previously discussed  as well as the impairment recorded on its long lived assets when performing its annual goodwill impairment analysis 
with the assistance of the independent valuation firm  we determined the fair values of each of our reporting units utilizing both discounted cash flow and market based methodologies 
we have defined our reporting segments hid and ced as our reporting units for goodwill accounting 
the analysis indicated that the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 we were required to perform the second step of the impairment testing for both reporting units 
this entailed adjusting the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit to their fair market values as of december   for purposes of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of such goodwill 
the analysis indicated a goodwill impairment of million for hid and million for ced 
these amounts were recorded in the fourth quarter of operating income loss consolidated operating results for the year ended december  decreased million to a million loss compared to a million operating profit in the corresponding period last year  million of this decrease is the goodwill and long lived asset impairment charge

the complaint alleges that the company failed to pay overtime wages  provide meal and rest periods and reimbursement for expenses incurred in performing examinations 
the plaintiff is attempting to have the lawsuit certified as a class action on behalf of other examiners who perform similar work for the company in california 
we currently employ approximately examiners in california and have employed in excess of  examiners in california over the past months 
the company believes that it has properly paid its california examiners for overtime worked and intends to provide a vigorous defense to this litigation 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit 
in the past  some state agencies have claimed that we improperly classified our examiners as independent contractors for purposes of state unemployment tax laws and that we were therefore liable for taxes in arrears  or for 
table of contents penalties for failure to comply with such state agencies interpretations of the laws 
we received an adverse determination in the state of california  and as a result  converted our examiners located in the state of california to employees 
other similar state claims are also pending 
there are no assurances that we will prevail in these cases  or that we will not be subject to similar claims in other states in the future 
on july   the company received a determination from the internal revenue service that one individual the company contracted with as an independent contractor should have been classified as an employee in this ruling also applies to any other individuals engaged by the company under similar circumstances 
the ruling states that the company may not be subject to adverse consequences  as the company may be entitled to relief under applicable tax laws section of the revenue act of 
management believes that the company qualifies for relief under section to date  the company has not received any further communication from the internal revenue service and considers the matter closed 
the company is a party to a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business 
in the opinion of management  the company has substantial legal defenses and or insurance coverage with respect to all of its pending legal actions 
accordingly  none of these actions is expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  its consolidated results of operations or its consolidated financial position 
inflation inflation has not had  nor is it expected to have  a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s operating results and or financial condition and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these determinations upon the best information available to us during the period in which we are accounting for our results 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change or as further information becomes available 
further  these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
changes in our estimates are recorded in the period the change occurs 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing  independent medical exam  peer review or similar services and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
in all cases  there must be evidence of an agreement with the customer  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery of services must occur and collectibility must be reasonably assured 
revenue for certain services performed for the legal profession is recognized upon the successful outcome of the case 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for i estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and ii amounts that customers may deduct from their remittances to the company for billed items not in compliance with customer specifications 
management continuously assesses the financial condition of our customers and the markets in which these customers participate and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this periodic review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 

table of contents we must make significant management judgments and estimates in determining allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
one significant uncertainty inherent in our analysis is whether our past experience will be indicative of future periods 
adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect our allowance estimates  collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process to identify if there is an impairment includes the following steps a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows from the business group to the carrying value of the long lived assets  and if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is identified 
the amount of the impairment is usually determined by acquiring an outside fair value assessment of the long lived assets and writing down the long lived assets to its fair value 
valuation of goodwill we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value to its fair value 
an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process of determining impairment 
in step one  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using a combination of discounted cash flows and market multiples 
the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value and if the carrying value exceeds the fair value there is an impairment 
the second step identifies the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined as though the reporting unit was involved in a business acquisition 
ie the existing assets and liabilities are adjusted to fair market value and a valuation is placed on any unrecorded intangibles 
the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit and the difference is implied goodwill 

table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
if we were to establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
share based compensation the company has stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the company continues to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
compensation expense for stock options granted to an employee or director is recognized in net income loss based on the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant or other measurement date  over the amount an employee or director must pay to acquire the common stock 
when the exercise price of the option granted to an employee or director equals or exceeds the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant  the company does not recognize compensation expense 
the company elected not to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
had the company adopted the fair value based method provisions of sfas no 
 it would have recorded a non cash expense for the estimated fair value of the stock options that the company has granted to its employees and directors 
on january   the company  accelerated the vesting of all of the company s unvested stock options awarded to officers and employees under the   and stock option plans  all of which had an exercise price greater than  the closing price of the company s common stock on the american stock exchange on january  as a result of the acceleration  options to acquire approximately million shares  with exercise prices ranging from to  of the company s common stock which otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next months  became immediately exercisable 
on december   the company accelerated the vesting of options for all grants which had an exercise price equal to or greater than  the closing price of the company s common stock on december  as a result of the acceleration  options to acquire  shares with exercise prices ranging from to  of the company s common stock which would have otherwise vested over the next years  became immediately exercisable 
the board s decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was in response to a review of the company s long term incentive compensation programs in light of changes in market practices and changes in accounting rules resulting from the issuance of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r as previously discussed 
management believes that accelerating the vesting of these options prior to the adoption of sfas r  will result in the company not being required to recognize compensation expense of million in and million in subsequent years through the company  with the assistance of an outside stock option valuation company  has calculated the fair value of awards granted subsequent to december  thus far in   shares of our common stock were granted to our ceo on january  these options have a fair value of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
when sfas no 
r becomes effective  it will replace sfas no 
and supersede apb and will require companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
as required  we will adopt the new standard effective january  utilizing the modified prospective basis as allowed under sfas no 
r 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fasr  transition election to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in sfas no 
r or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp 
an entity that adopts sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application may make a one time election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp 
an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no 
r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its on time election 
this fsp became effective in november we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this fsp in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
r 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company invests in securities with high quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company does not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
the company s debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
the company mitigates this risk by investing in only high credit quality securities that it believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to be able to be responsive to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  estimated in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate investments average interest rates the company is also exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s borrowings are under variable rate instruments 
future payments due under borrowings are million in january  at an average interest rate of 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to the british pound 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates by measuring the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows 
while our uk subsidiary results of operations and financial condition are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we do not consider the related risk to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
if the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar were to decrease  the effect on net income would have been negligible 
based on the company s market risk sensitive instruments including investments and variable rate debt outstanding at december   the company has determined that there was no material market risk exposure to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
