item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under risk factors herein 
general we were formed in october to invest primarily in mortgage related assets including mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage loans and other securities representing interests in  or obligations backed by  pools of mortgage loans which can be readily financed 
we commenced operations on march  upon the closing of our ipo 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to stockholders based upon the spread between the interest income on our mortgage related assets and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of these assets 
we are organized for tax purposes as a reit 
accordingly  we generally distribute substantially all of our earnings to stockholders without paying federal or state income tax at the corporate level on the distributed earnings 
as of december   our qualified reit assets real estate assets  as defined in the code  cash and cash items and government securities were greater than of our total assets  as compared to the code requirement that at least of our total assets must be qualified reit assets 
greater than of our revenue qualifies for both the source of income test and the source of income test under the reit rules 
we believe we met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distributions of our net income 
therefore  we believe that we continue to qualify as a reit under the provisions of the code 
on november   we formed our wholly owned subsidiary  belvedere trust  to acquire  own and securitize mortgage loans with a focus on the high credit quality jumbo adjustable rate  hybrid and first lien mortgage markets 
belvedere trust acquires mortgage loans and other mortgage related assets  securitizes a substantial amount of those mortgage loans and then retains a portion of those mortgage backed securities  while selling the balance to third parties in the secondary market 
the mortgage backed securities that are retained are purchased by a qualified reit subsidiary to maximize tax efficiency on the interest income on those securities 
belvedere trust was formed as a qualified reit subsidiary  but it structures securitizations through taxable reit subsidiaries which generally are taxed as c corporations subject to full corporate taxation  which in turn establish spes that issue securities through remic trusts 
since its formation  belvedere trust has become an increasingly important part of our overall operations and  as of december   belvedere trust s assets comprised of our overall assets 
through december   we had made an investment of approximately million in belvedere trust to capitalize its mortgage operations 
belvedere trust is externally managed by bt management 
bt management manages belvedere trust through a management agreement with belvedere trust pursuant to which bt management manages the day to day operations of belvedere trust in exchange for an annual base management fee and a quarterly incentive fee 
on may   belvedere trust filed a registration statement with the sec for the purpose of registering up to million of its common stock in connection with a contemplated ipo 
belvedere trust filed amendments to the registration statement with the sec on june   july   august  and september  we do not intend to sell any of our shares of belvedere trust s common stock in the ipo 
in december  after discussions with the underwriters  the company and belvedere trust determined that the ipo would be delayed due to current market conditions 
it is still our and belvedere trust s intent to pursue an ipo when market conditions improve 
as a result of the delay in their ipo  belvedere trust expensed approximately thousand in offering costs that had previously been deferred 

table of contents at december   we had total assets of billion 
our portfolio consisted of billion of agency mortgage backed securities distributed as follows agency adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  agency hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  agency fixed rate mortgage backed securities and less than agency floating rate cmos

during the year ended december   premium amortization expense for anworth decreased million  or  from million to million  and for belvedere trust  it increased million  or  from million to million 
during the year ended december   the decrease in premium amortization expense for anworth resulted from a decrease of the constant prepayment rate of its portfolio and the increase in premium amortization expense for belvedere trust resulted from an increase in its assets and an increase in the constant prepayment rate of its portfolio of loans and other mortgage related assets

the larger percentage increase in interest expense was due primarily to the increase in interest rates during premium amortization expense for anworth increased million  or  from million to million  and it was million for belvedere trust  during the year ended december  due to the increase in assets

financial condition at december   we held agency mortgage assets whose amortized cost was approximately billion  consisting primarily of billion of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  million of floating rate cmos and million of fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
this amount represents an approximate decrease from the billion held at december  of the adjustable rate agency mortgage backed securities owned by us  were adjustable rate pass through certificates whose coupons reset within one year 
the remaining consisted of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities whose coupons will reset between one year and five years 
hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have an initial interest rate that is fixed for a certain period  usually three to five years  and thereafter adjust annually for the remainder of the term of the loan

at december  and  the unamortized net premium paid for our mortgage backed securities was million and million  respectively 
we analyze our mortgage backed securities and the extent to which prepayments impact the yield of the securities 
when the rate of prepayments exceeds expectations  we amortize the premiums paid on mortgage assets over a shorter time period  resulting in a reduced yield to maturity on our mortgage assets 
conversely  if actual prepayments are less than the assumed constant prepayment rate  the premium would be amortized over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity

geographic concentration december  december  southern california northern california florida virginia illinois colorado michigan nevada other states none greater than total our residential real estate loan portfolio of billion as of december  includes thousand of loans pending securitization and billion in loans which have been securitized 
the securitized residential real estate loans serve as collateral for billion of mortgage backed securities issued and million of repurchase agreement financings 
belvedere trust structures securitization transactions primarily through spes such as remic trusts as discussed on page under critical accounting policies 
the principal business activity involves issuing various series of mortgage backed securities in the form of pass through certificates or bonds collateralized by residential real estate loans 
the collateral specific to each mortgage backed securities series is the sole source of repayment of the debt and  therefore  our exposure to loss is limited to our net investment in the collateral 
although the billion of residential real estate loans which have been securitized are consolidated on our balance sheets  the spes that hold such loans  including bellavista funding corporation  are legally separate from us and belvedere trust 
consequently  the assets of these spes including the securitized mortgage loans are not available to our creditors or to creditors of belvedere trust 
only our interest in the securities issued by the spes are legal assets of anworth and belvedere trust 
of the mortgage backed securities including our first securitization  billion in principal amount outstanding at december  have been sold to third parties and million have been retained by belvedere trust 
the securities retained by belvedere trust include million of aaa class  million of aa class and million of classes less than aa 
at december   belvedere trust owned approximately thousand in loans held for securitization 
this figure includes the face amount of the mortgages  premium and principal and interest receivable 
the loans consist of adjustable rate single family residential mortgages 
hedging we periodically enter into derivative transactions  in the form of forward purchase commitments and interest rate swaps  which are intended to hedge our exposure to rising rates on funds borrowed to finance our investments in securities 
we designate interest rate swap transactions as cash flow hedges 
we also enter into derivative transactions  in the form of forward purchase commitments  which are not designated as hedges 
to the extent that we enter into hedging transactions to reduce our interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets  any income or gain from the disposition of hedging transactions should be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
as part of our asset liability management policy  we may enter into hedging agreements such as interest rate caps  floors or swaps 
these agreements would be entered into to try to reduce interest rate risk and would be designed to provide us with income and capital appreciation in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
we review the need for hedging agreements on a regular basis consistent with our capital investment policy 
at december   we were a counter party to swap agreements  which are derivative instruments as defined by the financial accounting standards board in fasb and fasb  with an aggregate notional amount of 
table of contents million and an average maturity of years 
we utilize swap agreements to manage interest rate risk and do not anticipate entering into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
in accordance with the swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest during the term of the swap agreements and receive a payment that varies with the three month libor rate 
at december   there were unrealized gains of approximately million on our swap agreements 
to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on the consummation of forward loan purchase commitments in connection with planned securitization funding  belvedere trust may enter into eurodollar futures transactions 
there is typically a time difference between the date we enter into an agreement to purchase whole loans and the date on which we fix the interest rates paid for securitization financing 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations during this period 
in order to mitigate this risk  we hedge our position using eurodollar futures 
we do not designate the eurodollar futures for hedge accounting 
once the financing rates on the securitization are fixed  we remove the hedge positions 
we recognize the change in value of the projected cash flows on loans that we have purchased and loans that we have committed to purchase as well as the change in value of the eurodollar futures transactions 
the difference between these changes in value is included in income during the current period 
for the three months and for the year ended december   there were no recognized gains or recognized losses incurred on eurodollar futures transactions 
as of december   belvedere trust did not have any outstanding eurodollar futures positions 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds consists of repurchase agreements  relative to our agency mbs portfolio  which totaled billion at december  and belvedere trust s repurchase agreements  which totaled million at december  belvedere trust also had thousand in whole loan financing at december  our other significant source of funds for the year ended december  consisted of payments of principal from our agency mortgage securities portfolio in the amount of billion and million from our residential real estate loans 
relative to our agency mbs portfolio  as of december   all of our repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from five days to twenty four months 
belvedere trust enters into its own repurchase agreements 
as of december   other than three repurchase agreements that reprice monthly subject to a cap  all of belvedere trust s repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from one to thirty six months 
on december   we had borrowing arrangements with different financial institutions and had borrowed funds under repurchase agreements with of these firms 
as the repurchase agreements mature  we enter into new repurchase agreements to take their place 
because we borrow money based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities and because increases in short term interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of mortgage backed securities  our borrowing ability could be reduced and lenders may initiate margin calls in the event short term interest rates increase or the value of our mortgage backed securities declines for other reasons 
we had adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements during the year ended december  we acquire residential mortgage loans from third party originators  including banks and other mortgage lenders  through our belvedere trust subsidiary 
belvedere trust structures securitization transactions primarily through spes such as remic trusts 
the principal business activity involves issuing various series of mortgage backed securities in the form of pass through certificates or bonds collateralized by residential real estate loans 
the collateral specific to each mortgage backed securities series is the sole source of repayment of the debt and  therefore  our exposure to loss is limited to our net investment in the collateral 
during the three months ended december   belvedere trust did not transfer any residential mortgage loans to securitization trusts 
during the year ended december   we transferred approximately billion of residential mortgage loans to securitization trusts 
these transactions utilized non qualified spes requiring consolidation  which effectively resulted in the transactions being accounted for as financings 
the servicing of the mortgage loans is performed by third parties under servicing arrangements that resulted in no servicing asset or liability 

table of contents during the year ended december   belvedere trust transferred approximately billion of residential mortgage loans in six separate transactions to securitization trusts pursuant to pooling and third party servicing agreements 
five of the six securitization transactions in  totaling approximately billion  utilized non qualified spes requiring consolidation  which effectively resulted in the transactions being accounted for as financings 
the residential real estate loans remain as assets on our consolidated balance sheets subsequent to securitization  and the financing resulting from these securitizations is shown on our consolidated balance sheets as mortgage backed securities issued 
the servicing of the mortgage loans is performed by third parties under servicing arrangements that resulted in no servicing asset or liability 
one securitization transaction as more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of of approximately million was accounted for as a sale 
since its formation  belvedere trust has securitized approximately billion of mortgage loans 
in the future  we expect that our primary sources of funds will continue to consist of borrowed funds under repurchase agreement transactions and of monthly payments of principal and interest on our mortgage backed securities portfolio and other mortgage related assets 
our liquid assets generally consist of unpledged mortgage backed securities  cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   we had raised approximately million in capital under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
at december   our authorized capital included million shares of par value preferred stock 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  par value per share  liquidation preference per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
at december   belvedere trust did not have any commitments to purchase mortgage loans and had whole loan financing facilities which provide for up to billion in financing secured by single family mortgage loans 
at december   belvedere trust has borrowed thousand under the facilities  secured by mortgage loans held for securitization with a face value of thousand 
during the year ended december   we repurchased as more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
the shares were acquired at prevailing prices through open market transactions and were made subject to restrictions related to volume  pricing and timing subject to applicable sec rules 
off balance sheet and contractual arrangements the following table represents the company s contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years repurchase agreements anworth repurchase agreements belvedere trust whole loan financing facilities mortgage backed securities issued junior subordinated notes lease commitment belvedere trust total these represent amounts due by maturity 
principal is paid on the mortgage backed securities issued following receipt of principal payments on the loans 
for the table above  the principal payments have been estimated based on the underlying contractual payments as adjusted for prepayment assumptions 
the actual principal paid in each year will be dependent upon the principal received on the underlying loans 

table of contents these represent amounts due by contractual maturity 
however  we do have the option to redeem these after march  and april  this does not include annual compensation agreements  leases with affiliates and incentive compensation agreements which are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

principal is paid on the mortgage backed securities issued following receipt of principal payments on the loans 
for the table above  the principal payments have been estimated based on the underlying contractual payments as adjusted for prepayment assumptions 
the actual principal paid in each year will be dependent upon the principal received on the underlying loans 
these commitments are off balance sheet arrangements 
this does not include annual compensation agreements  leases and incentive compensation agreements which are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our agency mortgage backed securities which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value rather than historical cost 
real estate loans are carried at historical cost 
based upon these treatments  our total equity base at december  was million 
common stockholders equity was approximately million  or book value per share 
under our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in fair values of assets do not impact generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  income or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting on all of our assets 
as a result  comparisons with some companies that use historical cost accounting for all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
unrealized changes in the fair value of mortgage backed securities have one significant and direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes will tend to reduce borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mortgage backed securities might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
accumulative other comprehensive income  unrealized loss on available for sale agency securities was million  or of the amortized cost of agency mortgage backed securities at december  this  along with accumulative other comprehensive gain  derivatives  of million  and accumulative other comprehensive loss  other mbs  of million  constitute the total accumulative other comprehensive loss of million 

table of contents critical accounting policies management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
management has reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
nevertheless  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant source of our revenue is derived from our investments in mortgage backed securities 
we reflect income using the effective yield method which  through amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts at an effective yield  recognizes periodic income over the estimated life of the investment on a constant yield basis  as adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
management believes our revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
interest income on our mortgage backed securities is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal amount of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the expected lives of the securities using the effective interest yield method adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments based on the statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
our policy for estimating prepayments speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  as compared to the aforementioned references  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
allowance for loan losses we establish and maintain an allowance for estimated loan losses inherent in our residential real estate loan portfolio 
the loan loss reserves are based upon our assessment of various factors affecting the credit quality of our assets including  but not limited to  the characteristics of the loan portfolio  review of loan level data  borrowers credit scores  delinquency and collateral value 
the reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as deemed necessary 
the allowance for loan losses on our real estate loans is established by taking loan loss provisions through our consolidated statements of income 
valuation of investment securities we carry our investment securities on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our mortgage backed securities are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets in such securities 
the fair values of other marketable securities are obtained from the last reported sale of such securities on its principal exchange or  if no representative sale is reported  the mean between the closing bid and ask prices 
if  in the opinion of management  one or more securities prices reported to us are not reliable or unavailable  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security it receives from the issuer and available market information 
the fair values reported reflect estimates and may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
losses on securities classified as 
table of contents available for sale  which are determined by management to be other than temporary in nature  are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to current operations 
variable interest entities belvedere trust structures securitization transactions primarily through non qualified spes such as remic trusts 
the principal business activity involves issuing various series of mortgage backed securities in the form of pass through certificates or bonds collateralized by residential real estate loans 
the collateral specific to each series of mortgage backed securities is the sole source of repayment of the debt and  therefore  our exposure to loss is limited to our net investment in the collateral 
under financial accounting standards board interpretation  or fin  these interests in non qualified spes are deemed to be variable interest entities  or vies  and we are considered the primary beneficiary 
therefore  we consolidate these non qualified spes 
in addition  we consolidate our interest in loans financed through warehouse agreements where we are acquiring assets prior to securitization 
we disclose our interests in vies under fin in the investments in residential real estate loans footnote note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
residential real estate loans we acquire residential mortgage loans and hold them as long term investments through our belvedere trust subsidiary 
we finance the mortgage loans with short term debt see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements until a sufficient quantity has been accumulated for securitization into mortgage backed securities in order to obtain long term financing and to enhance liquidity 
while all mortgage loans are acquired with the intention of securitizing them  we may not be successful in our efforts to securitize the loans into mortgage backed securities 
our residential real estate loans are classified as held for investment and are carried at their unpaid principal balance  adjusted for unamortized premiums or discounts 
premiums or discounts are amortized into current operations using the effective interest yield method  as adjusted for actual prepayments and considering estimated future prepayments  based on fas to meet our investment criteria  mortgage loans acquired by us will generally conform to the underwriting guidelines established by freddie mac  fannie mae and ginnie mae  or to secondary market standards for high credit quality mortgage loans 
applicable banking laws generally require that an appraisal be obtained in connection with the original issuance of mortgage loans by the lending institution and we do not intend to obtain additional appraisals at the time of acquiring mortgage loans 
mortgage loans may be originated by or purchased from various suppliers of mortgage related assets throughout the united states including savings and loans associations  banks  mortgage bankers and other mortgage lenders 
we may acquire mortgage loans directly from originators and from entities holding mortgage loans originated by others 
belvedere trust maintains an allowance for loan losses for residential real estate loans held in consolidated securitization trusts and for loans held prior to securitization 
the balance is included in allowance for loan losses on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes other than bt finance  as noted below  our financial results do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow us to be taxed as a reit and as a result does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
bt finance  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  is a taxable reit subsidiary and may be liable for corporate income tax expenses 
subsequent events none 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity for stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through ownership of our common stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk we primarily invest in adjustable rate  hybrid and fixed rate mortgage related assets 
hybrid mortgages are adjustable rate mortgages that have a fixed interest rate for an initial period of time typically three years or greater and then convert to an adjustable rate for the remaining loan term 
our debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates 
adjustable rate mortgage related assets are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount an adjustable rate mortgage related asset s interest rate can change during any given period 
adjustable rate mortgage securities are also typically subject to a minimum interest rate payable 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
hence  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mortgage related assets could be limited 
this problem would be magnified to the extent we acquire mortgage related assets that are not fully indexed 
further  some adjustable rate mortgage related assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our liquidity  net income and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we fund the purchase of a substantial portion of our adjustable rate mortgage related assets with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net interest income  dividend yield and the market price of our common stock 
most of our adjustable rate assets are based on the one year constant maturity treasury rate and the one year libor rate and our debt obligations are generally based on libor 
these indices generally move in the same direction  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
our adjustable rate mortgage related assets and borrowings reset at various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of our debt obligations occurs more quickly than on our assets 
therefore  on average  our cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does our earnings rate on the assets 
further  our net income may vary somewhat as the spread between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies

belvedere trust primarily uses securitization transactions to manage the interest rate risk of its mortgage portfolio 
the payments due on the securities generally match the cash flow from the underlying mortgage loans 
belvedere trust s interest rate risk management program is formulated with the intent to offset  to some extent  the potential adverse effects resulting from rate adjustment limitations on its portfolio of mortgage assets and the differences between interest rate adjustment indices and interest rate adjustment periods of its adjustable rate mortgage related assets and related borrowings 
belvedere trust finances certain of its retained and acquired securities with repurchase agreements which have different adjustment periods than the related assets 
as part of its interest rate risk management program  belvedere trust has entered into term repurchase agreements that fix the rate of interest or  in some cases  cap the rate of interest on a portion of the borrowings secured by belvedere trust s mortgage related assets 
market value risk substantially all of our mortgage backed securities and equity securities are classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie  market value with the periodic adjustment to fair value reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the equity section of our balance sheet 
the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 

table of contents liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mortgage backed securities with short term debt 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
for example  at december   our agency adjustable rate mortgage backed securities had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months  while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions  the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from mortgage backed securities 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss during these periods 
our assets that are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  we have not had difficulty rolling over our short term borrowings as they mature 
there can be no assurance that we will always be able to roll over our short term debt 
at december   we had unrestricted cash of million and million in unpledged agency mortgage backed securities available to meet margin calls on short term borrowings that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender collateralization requirements 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates on mortgage related securities and mortgage loans vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of adjustable rate mortgage loans usually can be expected to increase when mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on such loans and decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such loans  although such effects are not entirely predictable 
prepayment rates may also be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans underlying mortgage backed securities 
the purchase prices of mortgage backed securities are generally based upon assumptions regarding the expected amounts and rates of prepayments 
where slow prepayment assumptions are made  we may pay a premium for mortgage backed securities 
to the extent such assumptions differ from the actual amounts of prepayments  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
the total prepayment of any mortgage backed securities purchased at a premium by us would result in the immediate write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
finally  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be harmed 
we often purchase mortgage related assets that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we must pay a premium over par value to acquire these assets 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mortgage backed security 
as we receive repayments of mortgage principal  we amortize the premium balances as a reduction to our income 
if the mortgage loans underlying a mortgage backed security were prepaid at a faster rate than we anticipate  we would amortize the premium at a faster rate 
this would reduce our income 
tabular presentation anworth agency mortgage backed securities the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on anworth s annual projected net interest income and projected portfolio value excluding belvedere trust s operations as more fully discussed below  based on investments in place at december   and includes all of anworth s interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and hedges such as interest rate swap agreements 
changes in projected net interest income equals the change that would occur in the calculated projected net interest income for the next twelve months relative to the change scenario if interest rates were to instantaneously parallel shift to and remain at the stated level for the next twelve months 

table of contents changes in projected portfolio value equals the change in value of our assets that anworth carries at fair value rather than at historical amortized cost and any change in the value of any derivative instruments or hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements 
anworth acquires interest rate sensitive assets and funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
anworth generally plans to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s best estimate of the effects of changes in interest rates on prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
the above table includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was million and the average maturity was years

general many assumptions are made to present the information in the above tables  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes  therefore  the above tables and all related disclosures constitute forward looking statements 
the analyses presented utilize assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change the interest rate risk profile for anworth and belvedere trust 
the tables quantify the potential changes in net income and net asset value should interest rates immediately change are shocked 
the results of interest rate shocks of plus and minus and basis points are presented 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mortgage related assets for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions  including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates no negative rates are utilized  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of mortgage related assets relative to prevailing interest rates
