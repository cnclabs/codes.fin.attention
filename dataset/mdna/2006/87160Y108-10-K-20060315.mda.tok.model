table of contents asic prototyping solution certify in  we introduced certify  a software product for the verification of asics using prototypes consisting of multiple fpgas 
our certify product enables design teams to create hardware prototypes early in the design process when design changes are easier and less costly 
in  and  revenue from our asic prototyping product line accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
additionally  we periodically provide custom software development services for our customers or partners 
this work typically involves modifications to our existing product line under a statement of work negotiated with the customer 
in  and  revenue from custom software development services accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
our total revenue is comprised of license revenue and maintenance revenue 
for the  and   and  respectively  of our sales have come from perpetual and term license sales 
the majority of the remaining sales have come from time based licenses 
customers who buy perpetual licenses will typically sign one year maintenance agreements which provide electronic  internet based technical support and telephone support as well as unspecified product updates when and if available 
time based licenses include maintenance services for the duration of their respective terms 
we also offer two year and three year term licenses for certain products under which the customer purchases the first year of maintenance with the license and can renew maintenance in each of the following one or two years 
custom software development services revenue is recorded in license revenue 
financial highlights total revenue for was million  a increase from million in license revenue for was million  a increase from million in maintenance revenue for was million  a increase from million in operating income for was million  a increase from million in net income for was million  a increase from million in diluted net income per share for was a increase from in working capital for was million a increase from million in deferred revenue for was million a increase from million in critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition in accordance with aicpa statement of position  modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions  we recognize revenue based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered and the conditions stated below have been met evidence of an arrangement is received from the customer  
table of contents delivery of the product and license key has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  and we have no remaining obligations other than maintenance 
for each sale of a perpetual license  the first year of maintenance is generally sold with the license 
perpetual license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product 
maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance period since customers under maintenance agreements receive unspecified product updates  electronic  internet based technical support and telephone support throughout their maintenance period  which is typically one year 
the majority of our customers renew their maintenance contracts annually  at or near the list price for maintenance  which is either or of the perpetual license list price  depending on the product  which establishes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of maintenance 
we offer term licenses for certain products under which the customer purchases the first year of maintenance with the license and can renew maintenance in each of the following years 
revenue from term licenses is recognized in the same manner as revenue from perpetual licenses as vsoe of the fair value of maintenance is established by the maintenance renewal pricing 
we also sell time based licenses to use our software products for specified periods of time 
time based licenses include maintenance services only for the duration of their respective terms 
revenue from time based licenses is allocated between license and maintenance revenue in similar proportion to perpetual license transactions  and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the maintenance  as we do not have vsoe of the fair value of maintenance for time based licenses since it is not priced or offered separately 
in addition  we have provided a version of one of our products to certain field programmable gate array fpga manufacturers for distribution to their customers 
as part of this arrangement we have certain maintenance and support obligations to the fpga manufacturers 
revenue on this arrangement is also allocated to license and maintenance revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of maintenance  as we do not have vsoe of fair value of maintenance for these arrangements since it is not priced or offered separately 
furthermore  we may sell time based licenses and perpetual or term licenses combined within a single order 
for these transactions  we generally recognize revenue from the entire transaction on a straight line basis over the term of the longest time based license in the transaction  as generally we do not have vsoe on time based licenses 
we have entered into various development agreements with semiconductor manufacturers to customize certain of our tools 
when time based licenses are being purchased as part of the agreement  once the contract has been signed  delivery of the customized product has occurred  collection of the fee is probable and we have no remaining obligations other than maintenance  we recognize revenue from both the development and license fees on a straight line basis over the period of the licenses  as we do not have vsoe for these agreements 
when licenses are not being purchased as part of the agreement  once the contract has been signed  we recognize revenue from the development fees on a percentage of completion basis 
revenue recognized from these development agreements represented less than of total revenue in  and and is recorded in license revenue 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable for sales with non standard payment terms by evaluating our history of collections from these customers and or their current financial standing 
we make judgments as to whether collection of the fee is probable based on the analysis provided by our credit review procedures 
revenue on arrangements to end user customers that have met all of the revenue recognition criteria except probability of collection is recognized as collection becomes reasonably assured  
table of contents which is generally as payments are received 
revenue on sales to distributors is considered to have met the probability of collection criterion when the distributor has resold the product to an end user and either we have received payment for the product or we assess that we have a substantial and sustained history of collections from the distributor 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment using a fair value approach 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter as well as whenever indicators of impairment exist 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  long lived assets  including intangible assets and property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a long lived asset other than goodwill is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results and cash flows and  should different conditions prevail or judgments be made  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur  however  no impairment to date has been recorded 
our intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of three to five years 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and update quarterly an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the balance in the allowance account is comprised of a specific reserve for any particular receivable when collectibility is not probable and a provision for non specific accounts based on a specified range of percentages derived from historical experience applied to the outstanding balance in each aged group 
if after pursuing collection efforts on a specifically reserved receivable  payment is not expected  the receivable is deemed uncollectible and is written off 
such losses have not been material in any year  however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the table in schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves of this annual report provides a roll forward of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and such evaluations are based on available evidence of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our evaluation for the year ending december  is subject to the current economic uncertainty in our industry that limits our ability to generate verifiable forecasts of future domestic taxable income

there will be modest increases in headcount and increased salaries 
we expect to increase our research and development headcount in india 
in sales and marketing  the headcount increase will be marginal as we believe our worldwide channel is in place 
in general and administrative  we do not anticipate any new hires  however  our costs such as commission  rent  employee benefits and outside services for legal and accounting may increase

our income tax provision in included reversals of certain tax accruals established in prior years resulting from the final filing of our worldwide tax returns and the completion of several international transfer pricing studies that supported filed positions 
our provision for income taxes in differed from the tax provision that would have been derived from applying the federal statutory rate to the income before taxes primarily due to the use of net operating loss carryforwards and a reversal of previously provided taxes net of current year foreign income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in our provision for income taxes in differed from the tax provision that would have been derived from applying the federal statutory rate to the income before taxes primarily due to foreign income taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million 
management has evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas based on the current economic uncertainty in our industry that limits our ability to generate verifiable forecasts of future domestic taxable income  a valuation allowance in an amount equal to our net deferred tax assets of december  was recorded 
the valuation allowance decreased by approximately  in and increased by approximately million in as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions

in  and  net cash provided by financing activities was derived from the sale of common stock as employees exercised stock options and purchased shares through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by repurchases of our stock in and our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount  type and timing of product license sales  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the extent to which customers continue to renew annual maintenance contracts  the timing of customer payments and the collectibility of outstanding receivables  the cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these efforts  the cost and timing of sales and marketing activities  any acquisitions of products or technologies  any stock repurchases if a stock repurchase program is authorized  and the availability of financing 
we believe that our cash and short term investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may require additional financing within this period 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
in addition  even if we have sufficient funds to meet our anticipated cash needs in the next twelve months  we may choose to raise additional funds during this time 
we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be assured that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financings may be dilutive to shareholders  
table of contents and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell those products primarily in north america  europe and japan 
our revenue from sales outside north america represented approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
with the exception of sales in japan  our sales are generally made in us dollars  thus a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar  except for our japanese subsidiary whose functional currency is the yen 
the effects of translation of our foreign subsidiaries for which the us dollar is the functional currency are included in the results of operations  and to date have not been material 
the effects of translation of our japanese subsidiary are included in shareholders equity and to date have not been material 
historically  our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been minimal 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by basis points from rates as of december   the effect on our operating results and financial position would not be material 
however  as our international sales and operations have expanded  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has increased  particularly in japan 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the japanese yen 
the outstanding forward contracts generally have maturities of approximately one month from the date into which they were entered and are remeasured monthly using spot rates  with any gain or loss from rate fluctuations recorded in the statement of operations 
the changes in the values of the forward contracts were not material for the year ended december  
table of contents our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the change in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the us government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  and securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poors or the moody s equivalents  and or money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 
as of december   our cash equivalents consisted of commercial paper  money market funds and certificates of deposit and our short term investments consisted of us government agency notes  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  bankers acceptance and corporate notes
