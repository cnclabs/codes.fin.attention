sales growth in omnicare s existing pharmacy operations also served to further leverage its cost structure 
in addition to the benefits of economies of scale generated by these growth programs  the company also instituted other cost saving initiatives designed to respond to pricing and reimbursement pressures and to improve the overall cost efficiency of its operations  including the aforementioned commencement of a restructuring program in connection with the neighborcare acquisition 
the sales growth for the full year ended december  was driven largely by the ongoing execution of the company s acquisition strategy  which included acquisitions during the year  including the acquisitions of neighborcare in july and excellerx and rxcrossroads in august at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately billion  as further discussed below 
the total increase in sales as a result of all acquisitions is estimated at approximately million 
in addition  sales growth is also attributable to a full year contribution from acquisitions  increased acuity in certain areas  the contribution of clinical and other services  including disease management  drug price inflation and the further market penetration of newer branded drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly  which often carry higher prices but are significantly more effective in reducing overall healthcare costs than those they replace

at december   omnicare served long term care facilities and other chronic care settings comprising approximately  beds as compared with approximately  beds served at december  contributing in large measure to the growth in pharmacy services was the completion of acquisitions in  particularly the acquisitions of neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads 
the total increase in pharmacy services sales as a result of all acquisitions is estimated at approximately million 
in addition  pharmacy services sales increased due to a full year contribution from acquisitions  increased acuity in certain areas  the contribution of clinical and other services  including disease management  drug price inflation and the further market penetration of newer branded drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly  which often carry higher prices but are significantly more effective in reducing overall healthcare costs than those they replace 
the company estimates that drug price inflation for its highest dollar volume products in was approximately to 
these factors were partially offset by continuing government reimbursement reductions  both state and federal  including overall medicaid reimbursement formula changes in certain states  as well as drug specific pricing reductions or limitations on certain generic drugs  as well as intense competitive pricing pressures and the increasing use of generic drugs 
while the company is focused on reducing the impact of competitive pricing and reimbursement issues  there can be no assurance that such issues or other pricing and reimbursement pressures will not continue to impact the pharmacy services segment 
operating income of the pharmacy services segment was million in  a million improvement as compared with the million earned in as a percentage of the segment s sales  operating income was in  compared with in the increased operating income was primarily the result of the increased sales discussed above  the addition of neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads  the impact of productivity enhancement initiatives  as well as the overall synergies from the integration of prior period acquisitions 
pharmacy services operating income in the year ended december  also included an expected benefit of million attributable to the medication management performance provisions associated with a previously announced agreement with a third party under which omnicare provided certain services to a now completed disease management demonstration project 
in addition  the full year ended december  included the previously discussed charge of million pretax in connection with certain state medicaid audits related to prior periods 
the aforementioned positive factors were partially offset by the previously mentioned intensified competitive pricing and government reimbursement pressures  as well as  the previously mentioned restructuring charge  of which approximately million was included in the pharmacy services segment  a charge of approximately million for the settlement of litigation relating to certain contractual issues with two vendors  and a charge of million pretax for acquisition related expenses pertaining to a proposed transaction that was not consummated 
in addition  operating margins were unfavorably impacted by the addition of the large base of lower margin neighborcare business  which is currently in the process of being integrated 
although operating margins are generally unfavorably impacted by the initial addition of lower margin institutional pharmacy acquisitions  the integration efforts have historically resulted in drug purchasing improvements  the consolidation of redundant pharmacy locations and other economies of scale  which serve to leverage the company s operating cost structure and have historically resulted in improved operating margins in the long term as cost synergies were realized 
on july   omnicare completed its acquisition of neighborcare 
the acquisition  accounted for as a purchase business combination  included cash consideration of approximately billion 
the cash consideration included the payoff of certain neighborcare debt totaling approximately million  of which million was retired by the company immediately following the acquisition 
in addition  the company completed a tender offer for and subsequently purchased all of the million outstanding principal amount of neighborcare s senior subordinated notes  due the neighborcare notes 
the total consideration  excluding accrued and unpaid interest  paid for the neighborcare notes was approximately million 
at the time of the acquisition  neighborcare was an institutional pharmacy provider serving long term care and skilled nursing facilities  specialty hospitals and assisted and independent living communities comprising approximately  beds in states and the district of columbia 
neighborcare also provided infusion therapy services  home medical equipment  respiratory therapy services  community based retail pharmacies and group purchasing 
the neighborcare acquisition provides opportunities to achieve economies of scale and cost synergies 
the company has implemented an integration plan under which the processes have been put in place to achieve such savings in the purchasing of pharmaceuticals  the elimination of redundant functions and the consolidation of facilities in overlapping geographic territories

cro services segment omnicare s cro services segment recorded revenues of million for the year ended december   which were million  or  higher than the million recorded in the same prior year period 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 the company included million and million of reimbursable out of pockets in its cro services segment reported revenue and direct cost amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for were higher than in the same prior year period due primarily to the impact of the december clinimetrics acquisition and the aforementioned increase in reimbursable out of pockets of million under eitf no 
operating income in the cro services segment was million in compared with million in as a percentage of the segment s revenue  operating income was in compared with in this decrease is primarily attributable to the previously mentioned restructuring charge  of which approximately million was included in the cro services segment  primarily relating to facility lease obligations 
operating income versus the comparable prior year period was also unfavorably affected  especially in the first three months of the year  by the impact of the clinimetrics acquisition  largely as a result of the early completion of a large data management project  the results of which were accepted by the food and drug administration more rapidly than anticipated 
this resulted in lower revenues to coincide with the existent operating cost structure  which has since been modified through certain productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts 
operating results were also impacted by several client driven cancellations and delays in the commencement of certain projects during the fourth quarter of  and reflects the somewhat volatile nature of this business given the numerous variables that are outside the company s control 
backlog at december  of million was million less than the december  backlog of million  but was million higher than the september  backlog of million 
consolidated the company s consolidated gross profit of  million increased million for the full year from the same prior year period amount of  million 
gross profit as a percentage of total net sales of in the year ended december   was modestly lower than the experienced during positively impacting overall gross profit margin were the company s purchasing leverage associated with the procurement of pharmaceuticals and benefits realized from the company s formulary compliance program  the increased use of generic drugs  the impact of productivity enhancements  and the addition of the higher margin excellerx and rxcrossroads businesses 
in addition  the full year results included the previously discussed charge in connection with certain state medicaid audits related to prior periods  which lowered gross profit by approximately million 
the gross profit margin impact of these favorable year over year factors were more than offset by the addition of the large base of lower margin neighborcare business  the previously mentioned intensified competitive pricing and government reimbursement pressures  as well as the further market penetration of newer branded drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly  which typically produce higher gross profit  but lower gross profit margins 
increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts  rebates and other price concessions from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no or limited increases in fixed costs eg  rent  depreciation  etc 
and negligible to moderate increases in variable costs eg  utilities  labor  etc  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through both internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain volume discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs 
omnicare s selling  general and administrative operating expenses for the year ended december  of million were higher than the comparable year amount of million by million  due primarily to the overall growth of the business  including the aforementioned completion of several acquisitions  including neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads

operating expenses for the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by a million increase in amortization and depreciation expenses largely related to the acquisitions  the aforementioned million charge in connection with the legal settlement of certain contractual issues with two vendors  the aforementioned million charge for professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the new trust piers and the purchase of the company s senior subordinated notes due  and the aforementioned million charge for acquisition related expenses 
also initially impacting operating expenses were the acquisitions  including the addition of the neighborcare business  which had a higher operating cost structure at the time of the acquisition 
as the neighborcare integration plan is completed and expected cost synergies are realized  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales should be favorably impacted 
offsetting these factors were the favorable impact of leveraging fixed and variable overhead costs over a larger sales base in than that which existed in and the company s continued productivity enhancements  including the commencement of a restructuring program in connection with the neighborcare acquisition 
in addition  the full year ended december  included the previously discussed charge in connection with certain state medicaid audits related to prior periods  which increased operating expenses by approximately million 
investment income for the year ended december  of million was higher than the million earned in the comparable prior year period  primarily due to higher interest rates and average invested cash and plan asset balances versus the prior year 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million was higher than the million in the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased borrowings under the new debt issuances  as further discussed at the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section of this md a

these factors were partially offset by continued intensified competitive pricing pressures  medicaid reimbursement reductions  including overall reimbursement formula changes in certain states  as well as drug specific pricing reductions or limitations on certain generic drugs  and a continued shift in its payor mix toward lower margin medicaid business 
also impacting the results was the increased use of generic drugs and a special charge during in connection with certain state medicaid audits related to prior periods  which lowered sales by approximately million

although operating margins are initially unfavorably impacted by the addition of lower margin businesses when acquired  the integration efforts result in drug purchasing improvements  consolidation of redundant pharmacy locations and other economies of scale  which serve to leverage the company s operating cost structure 
partially offsetting the improved operating income in was the intensified competitive pricing and medicaid reimbursement pressures  the previously discussed special charge during the third and fourth quarters of  which lowered operating income by approximately million  the initial impact of recently completed acquisitions on margins  which impact is expected to diminish as the company achieves drug purchasing improvements  consolidation of redundant pharmacies and other economies of scale  and a continued shift in payor mix toward lower margin medicaid business

an additional million deferred payment was made relating to the sunscript acquisition in at the time of the acquisition  sunscript provided pharmaceutical products and related consulting services to skilled nursing and assisted living facilities comprising approximately  beds located in states excluding beds in sun healthcare facilities that sun healthcare intended to divest in unrelated transactions 
sunscript served these facilities through its network of long term care pharmacies 
the net assets and operating results of sunscript have been included from the date of acquisition in the company s financial statements 
cro services segment like others in the cro industry  the performance of the company s cro business reflects the somewhat volatile nature of this business given the numerous variables outside the company s control 
the softness in revenues in was attributable to several client driven cancellations or delays in the commencement or continuation of certain projects 
omnicare s cro services segment recorded revenues of million for the year ended december   which were million  or  lower than the million recorded in the same period in in accordance with eitf issue no

increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no increase in fixed costs eg  rent and minimal increases in variable costs eg  utilities  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below

restructuring programs program in the third quarter of  the company announced the implementation of certain consolidation plans and other productivity initiatives intended to streamline pharmacy services and contract research organization operations  including maximizing workforce and operating asset utilization  and producing a more cost efficient operating infrastructure 
these consolidations and productivity initiatives are related  in part  to the integration of neighborcare 
given the geographic overlap of the neighborcare and omnicare pharmacies  substantial opportunities for consolidation exist 
while the majority of consolidations will result in neighborcare pharmacies being consolidated into omnicare pharmacies  depending on location  capacity and operating performance  certain omnicare pharmacies have also been identified for consolidation into neighborcare locations 
additionally  as part of the evaluation process on how best to integrate the two organizations  the company also focused broadly on ways to lower operating infrastructure costs to maximize efficiencies and asset utilization and identified opportunities to right size the business  streamline operations and eliminate redundant assets 
this portion of the consolidation activity and other productivity initiatives are expected to result in the closure of omnicare facilities  of which are pharmacy operations

junior subordinated convertible debentures during the first quarter of  the company completed its offer to exchange up to million aggregate liquidation amount of the old trust piers of the old trust  for an equal amount of the new trust piers of the new trust 
the new trust piers have substantially similar terms to the old trust piers  except that the new trust piers have a net share settlement feature 
in connection with the exchange offer  the composition of the company s junior subordinated convertible debentures underlying the trust piers was impacted 
additional information regarding the junior subordinated convertible debentures underlying the old trust piers and the new trust piers is summarized below 
original junior subordinated convertible debentures in connection with the offering of the old trust piers in the second quarter of  the company issued a corresponding amount of junior subordinated convertible debentures the old debentures due to the old trust 
the old trust is a owned finance subsidiary of the company 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of the old trust 
the old trust piers offer fixed cash distributions at a rate of per annum payable quarterly  and a fixed conversion price of under a contingent conversion feature whereby the holders may convert their old trust piers if the closing sales price of company common stock for a predetermined period  beginning with the quarter ending september   is more than of the then applicable conversion price or  during a predetermined period  if the daily average of the trading prices for the old trust piers is less than of the average of the conversion values for the old trust piers through for any period thereafter through maturity 
the old trust piers also will pay contingent distributions  commencing with the quarterly distribution period beginning june   if the average trading prices of the old trust piers for a predetermined period equals or more of the stated liquidation amount of the old trust piers 
embedded in the old trust piers are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
the embedded derivatives are valued periodically by a third party advisor  and at december   the values of both derivatives embedded in the old trust piers were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
omnicare irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees  on a subordinated basis  certain payments to be made by the old trust in connection with the old trust piers 
subsequent to the first quarter exchange offering discussed in further detail at the series b junior subordinated convertible debentures caption below  the company has  aggregate liquidation amount of the old trust piers and underlying old debentures remaining outstanding at period end 
series b junior subordinated convertible debentures on march   the company completed the exchange of  aggregate liquidation amount of the old trust piers representing approximately of the total liquidation amount of the old trust piers outstanding for an equal amount of new trust piers of the new trust plus an exchange fee of per stated liquidation amount of old trust piers 
each new trust piers represents an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the new trust  which assets consist solely of a corresponding amount of series b junior subordinated convertible debentures the new debentures issued by the company with a stated maturity of june  the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of the new trust 
subsequent to the completion of the exchange offering and at period end  the company has  of new debentures outstanding 
the terms of the new trust piers are substantially identical to the terms of the old trust piers  except that the new trust piers are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of company common stock  whereas the outstanding old trust piers are convertible only into company common stock except for cash in lieu of fractional shares 
as of december   the aforementioned contingent conversion threshold of the old debentures and the new debentures had been attained 
as a result  the old debentures and the new debentures were convertible by the debt holders to cash and to common stock  and have been classified as current versus long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the purpose of the exchange offer was to change the conversion settlement provisions of the old trust piers 
as disclosed in the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements  the company made this change in response to the issuance by the eitf of the fasb of eitf issue no 
 which  effective december   changed the accounting rules applicable to the old trust piers and required the company to include the common stock issuable upon conversion of the old trust piers in the company s diluted shares outstanding  regardless of whether the market threshold has been met 
by committing to pay up to the stated liquidation amount of the new trust piers to be converted in cash upon conversion  the company is able to account for the new trust piers under the treasury stock method  which is expected to be less dilutive to earnings per share than the if converted method required by eitf in connection with the issuance of the old debentures and the new debentures  the company has deferred million in debt issuance costs  of which approximately million  million and million was amortized in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
as previously disclosed  the year ended december  included a special charge to operating expenses totaling million pretax in connection with the issuance of the new trust piers 
the credit agreement  the senior notes  the senior notes  the senior notes  the senior notes  the old and new debentures  and the convertible debentures contain representations and warranties  covenants and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are based on prevailing market rates as discussed in the following section 
the company believes that net cash flows from operating activities  credit facilities and other short and long term debt financings  will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital needs  acquisition contingency commitments  debt servicing  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
although the company has no current plans to refinance its indebtedness  issue additional indebtedness  or issue additional equity  the company believes that external sources of financing are readily available and will access them as deemed appropriate although no assurances can be given regarding the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had two unconsolidated entities  the old trust and the new trust  which were established for the purpose of facilitating the offerings of the old trust piers and the new trust piers  respectively 
for financial reporting purposes  the old trust and new trust are treated as equity method investments of the company 
the old trust and new trust are owned finance subsidiaries of the company 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of the old trust and new trust 
the old debentures issued by the company to the old trust and the new debentures issued by the company to the new trust in connection with the issuance of the old trust piers and the new trust piers  respectively  are presented as a single line item on omnicare s consolidated balance sheet  and the related disclosures concerning the old trust piers and the new trust piers  the guarantees and the old debentures and new debentures are included in omnicare s notes to consolidated financial statements 
omnicare records interest payable to the old trust and new trust as interest expense in its consolidated statement of income 
as of december   the company had no other unconsolidated entities  or any financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk omnicare s primary market risk exposure relates to variable interest rate risk through its borrowings 
accordingly  market risk loss is primarily defined as the potential loss in earnings due to higher interest rates on variable rate debt of the company 
the modeling technique used by omnicare for evaluating interest rate risk exposure involves performing sensitivity analysis on the variable rate debt  assuming a change in interest rates of basis points 
the company s debt obligations at december  include million outstanding under the variable rate term a loan at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million borrowed on a variable rate term loan at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due  and million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due in connection with its offering of million of senior notes  during the second quarter of  the company entered into a swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of six months  plus a spread of 
the estimated libor based floating rate including the spread was at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year 
the swap agreement  which matches the terms of the senior notes  is designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge 
the company is accounting for the swap agreement in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  so changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are offset by changes in the recorded carrying value of the related senior notes 
the fair value of the swap agreement of approximately million at december  is recorded as a noncurrent liability and a reduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes 
at december   the fair value of omnicare s variable rate debt facilities approximates the carrying value  as the effective interest rates fluctuate with changes in market rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt facilities is based on quoted market prices and is summarized as follows in thousands fair value of financial instruments december  financial instrument book value market value book value market value senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due junior subordinated convertible debentures  due convertible senior debentures  due embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
in addition  the convertible debentures include an interest reset provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued by a third party advisor  and at december   the values of the derivatives embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
in connection with the acquisition of canadian based medico pharmacy  omnicare entered into a million canadian foreign exchange transaction arrangement on december  this arrangement expired on january   and had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial position  income statement and cash flows of the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  omnicare management is required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates the estimates used  including those related to bad debts  contractual allowances  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill  insurance accruals  pension obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  legal and regulatory contingencies and other operating allowances and accruals 
management bases its estimates on a combination of factors  including historical experience  current conditions  feedback from outside advisors where feasible and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time and under the current circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the determination of the registrant s financial position and operating results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
omnicare s critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently and highly uncertain  including those matters further discussed below 
if actual results were to differ materially from the judgments and estimates made  the company s reported financial position and or operating results could be materially affected 
omnicare management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition omnicare recognizes revenue when products or services are delivered or provided to the customer 
pharmacy services segment a significant portion of the company s pharmacy services segment revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products have been reimbursed by state medicaid and  to a lesser extent  federal medicare programs 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date  to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions of the company are largely computerized  enabling on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount to be paid at the time of sale to record net revenues  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicaid and third party claims oftentimes approved once additional information is provided to the payor 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances for unbilled and or initially rejected claims on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled  and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments were not significant to the company s operations for any of the periods presented 
further  omnicare does not expect the reasonably possible effects of a change in estimate related to unsettled december  contractual allowance amounts from medicaid and third party payors to be significant to its future operating results  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
patient co payments are associated with certain state medicaid programs  medicare part b and certain third party payors and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered  but are billed to the individual as part of the company s normal billing procedures 
these co payments are subject to the company s normal accounts receivable collections procedures 
a patient may be dispensed prescribed medications typically no more than a day supply prior to insurance being verified in emergency situations  or for new facility admissions after hours or on weekends 
as soon as practicable typically the following business day  specific payor information is obtained so that the proper payor can be billed for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts returns of medications and issues a credit memo to the applicable payor 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based on historical return experience  giving consideration to the company s return policies 
product returns are processed in the period received and are not significant when compared to the overall sales and gross profit of the company 
contract research services segment a portion of the company s overall revenues relate to the contract research services cro segment  and are earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for units of service 
the company s contracts provide for additional service fees for scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue  on the respective lines of the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful accounts collection of accounts receivable from customers is the company s primary source of operating cash flow and is critical to omnicare s operating performance and financial condition 
omnicare s primary collection risk relates to facility and private pay customers 
the company provides a reserve for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
omnicare establishes this allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification approach  and considering such factors as historical collection experience ie  payment history and credit losses and creditworthiness  specifically identified credit risks  aging of accounts receivable by payor category  current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors 
management reviews this allowance on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances and the economic ability of customers to pay 
the company computes and monitors its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso in order to evaluate the liquidity and collection patterns of its accounts receivable 
dso is calculated by averaging the beginning and end of quarter accounts receivable  less contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts  to derive average accounts receivable  and dividing average accounts receivable by the sales amount excluding reimbursable out of pockets for the related quarter 
the resultant percentage is multiplied by the days in the quarter to derive the dso amount 
omnicare s dso was approximately days at december   which was relatively consistent with the december  dso of approximately days 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million at december  these allowances were and of gross receivables net of contractual allowances as of december  and  respectively 
although no near term changes are expected  unforeseen changes to future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages could materially impact the overall financial results and or financial position of the company 
for example  a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables as of december  would result in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts  as well as bad debt expense  of approximately million pretax 
the following table is an aging of the company s december  and gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowances for doubtful accounts  aged based on payment terms and categorized based on the four primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicaid  medicare part b and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicaid  medicare part b and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments patient charges pending approval from medicaid and third party payors are primarily billed as private pay and  where applicable  are recorded net of an estimated contractual allowance at period end 
once an approval to bill medicaid and or third party payors has been obtained  the private pay balance is reversed and a corresponding medicaid or third party receivable amount is recorded 
the company s policy is to resolve accounts receivable with pending status as soon as practicable  typically on a weekly basis 
pending accounts receivable balances were not a significant component of the overall accounts receivable balance at december  omnicare has standard policies and procedures for collection of its accounts receivable 
the company s collection efforts generally include the mailing of statements  followed up when necessary with delinquency notices  personal and other contacts  the use of an in house national collections department or outside collection agencies  and potentially mediation arbitration or litigation when accounts are considered unresponsive 
omnicare s collection efforts primarily relate to its facility and private pay customers 
when omnicare becomes aware that a specific customer is potentially unable to meet part or all of its financial obligations  for example  as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the national credit and collections department includes the exposed balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts requirements 
at such time that a balance is definitively deemed to be uncollectible by omnicare management including the national credit and collections department  collections agencies and or outside legal counsel  the balance is manually written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the company does not have a significant amount of its overall accounts receivable balance placed in mediation arbitration  litigation or with outside collection agencies 
given the company s experience  management believes that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if any of the company s larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations to omnicare  the company s overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate 
in particular  if economic conditions worsen  the payor mix shifts significantly  or the company s customers reimbursement rates are adversely affected  impacting omnicare s customers ability to pay their bills  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly  and the company s accounts receivable collections  cash flows  financial position and results of operations would then be  potentially  adversely affected 
inventories the company maintains inventory at lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the basis of the first in  first out method 
there are not any significant obsolescence reserves recorded since the company has not historically experienced nor does it expect to experience significant levels of inventory obsolescence write offs 
physical inventories are typically performed on a monthly basis at all pharmacy sites  and in all cases the company s policy is to perform them at least once a quarter 
cost of goods sold is recorded based on the actual results of the physical inventory counts  and is estimated when a physical inventory is not performed in a particular month 
the company evaluates various criteria in developing estimated cost of goods sold during non inventory months  including the historical cost of goods sold trends based on prior physical inventory results  a review of cost of goods sold information reflecting current customer contract terms  and consideration and analysis of changes in customer base  product mix  payor mix  state medicaid and third party insurance reimbursement levels or other issues that may impact cost of goods sold 
actual cost of goods sold has not varied significantly from estimated amounts in non physical inventory months 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually 
sfas requires the company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired  and requires goodwill to be tested between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its book carrying amount 
the company s assessments to date have indicated that goodwill has not been impaired 
the company s assessment of goodwill impairment is largely dependent on estimates of future cash flows at the aggregated reporting unit level  and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis is performed 
further  they require management s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
to the extent the book carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
changes in these estimates of future cash flows or weighted average cost of capital due to unforeseen events and circumstances could cause omnicare s analysis to indicate that goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods  and could result in the write off of a portion or all of the company s goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  considering the results of its latest goodwill impairment review  particularly given the substantial margin by which fair value exceeded carrying amounts in its largest segment  pharmacy services  the company does not anticipate a material impact on the consolidated financial statements from differences in these assumptions in the near term  although there can be no assurances given in this regard 
in connection with certain acquisitions  omnicare has engaged an independent valuation firm to assist with the identification and valuation of other identifiable intangible assets 
the company also continues to evaluate the tax effects and other preacquisition contingencies relating to these acquisitions 
omnicare is in the process of completing its purchase price allocation for these acquisitions and  accordingly  the related goodwill balance is preliminary and subject to change  and such changes could be material 
insurance accruals omnicare is self insured for certain employee health insurance claims 
the company manages its health insurance risk by obtaining individual and aggregate stop loss coverage in the amount of  per claim and of expected aggregate claims  or approximately million for the year 
omnicare insures all of its property and casualty programs including worker s compensation and professional liability in excess of self insured retentions  or deductibles  on the various policies of insurance which range from between  and  per claim  depending on the type of coverage 
omnicare closely monitors and continually evaluates its historical claims experience  and obtains input from third party insurance and valuation professionals  to estimate the appropriate level of accrual for its self insured programs  including deductibles 
these accruals include provision for incurred  as well as incurred but not yet reported  claims 
in developing its self insurance accrual estimates  the company s liability calculation also considers the historical claim lag periods and current payment trends of insurance claims generally months for health  and months for all other coverages 
a change in the historical claim lag period assumption by one month for health insurance claims would affect health insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
a change in the historical claim lag period by one month for property and casualty insurance claims would affect property and casualty insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
although significant fluctuations may occur in the short term due to unforeseen events potentially resulting in atypical claims experience  the company s historical claims experience  coupled with its stop loss coverages  has consistently supported management s assumption that this methodology provides for reasonable insurance expense estimates and accruals over a long term period 
while the ultimate settlement of these claims may vary  individually and in the aggregate  from the company s estimates and accruals  omnicare believes that the overall accrual amounts and resultant expense provided in the consolidated financial statements are materially correct 
employee benefit plans for certain of its employee benefit plans  the company utilizes estimates in developing its actuarial assumptions including such items as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  mortality rates  and the rate of compensation increase  among other items  and relies on actuarial computations to estimate the future potential liability  expense and funding requirements associated with these benefits 
while it is required that the actuarial assumptions be reviewed each year as of the measurement date of december  the actuarial assumptions generally do not change between measurement dates 
during omnicare s annual review  generally near the beginning of the fiscal year  the company reviews and updates these assumptions  and considers current market conditions and input from its third party advisors  including any changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
these actuarial assumptions and estimates attempt to anticipate future events  and if assessed differently or materially vary from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions used to calculate the company s pension obligation  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated operating results 
taxes the company estimates its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those relating to recently acquired subsidiaries  based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
omnicare periodically reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on the company s expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and omnicare s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax liabilities  including those relating to recently acquired subsidiaries  giving consideration to the relevant authoritative guidance  including sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  as well as sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  which requires an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates may change in the future  as actual results and any new information becomes known  and such changes could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income by jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate and related tax expense 
omnicare operates in a significant number of states and tax jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns in the normal course of business 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by applicable taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on omnicare s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience tax losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential tax gains 
a one percentage point change in the company s overall  and effective tax rates would impact tax expense and net income by million  million and million  respectively or  and per diluted share  respectively 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock incentive plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
for footnote disclosure purposes  the company calculates the impact of using the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas 
under the fair value method  the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees and directors is generally measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the vesting periods of the awards 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model incorporates reasoned assumptions  primarily regarding the expected volatility of the company s common stock price  estimated risk free interest rates  the expected dividend yield  if any  and the expected lives of the respective options 
considering the importance of each of the above assumptions in the calculation of fair value  the company re evaluates the estimate of these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while the company believes its stock option fair value calculations are materially accurate  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have a material impact on the fair value calculated for options or the related pro forma periodic expense recognized by the company in its footnote disclosures 
although omnicare continues to evaluate the impact of adopting sfas r in the first quarter of  omnicare currently expects the dilutive impact of this new standard on its financial results for to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately  based on outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards at december  to the extent that any new stock options or stock awards are granted subsequent to january   the estimated dilutive impact to omnicare s diluted earnings per share and thereafter would change accordingly 
legal contingencies as part of its ongoing operations  the company is subject to various inspections  audits  inquiries and similar actions by third parties  as well as governmental regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject and including reviews of individual omnicare pharmacy s reimbursement documentation and administrative practices 
oftentimes  these inspections  audits and inquiries relate to prior periods  including periods predating omnicare s actual ownership of a particular acquired unit 
the company is also involved with various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company reviews  including consultation with its outside legal advisors where applicable  the status of any inspections  audits  inquiries  legal claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any of these is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with sfas to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  the low end of the range is accrued  as required by gaap 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond the company s control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  omnicare reassesses the potential liability related to any pending inspections  audits  inquiries  claims and litigation and may revise its estimated exposure upward or downward accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position

the complaints seek  among other things  damages  restitution and injunctive relief 
the company believes the above described purported class and derivative actions are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions 
the company has received administrative subpoenas from the united states attorney s office  district of massachusetts  seeking information arising out of the company s relationships with certain manufacturers and distributors of pharmaceutical products 
the company believes that its purchases of pharmaceuticals comply with all applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  the federal government and certain states are investigating allegations relating to three generic pharmaceuticals provided by the company in connection with the substitution of capsules for tablets ranitidine  tablets for capsules fluoxetine and two mg tablets for one mg tablet buspirone 
the company is cooperating fully in these matters 
although the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company indemnifies the directors and officers of the company for certain liabilities that might arise from the performance of their job responsibilities for the company 
additionally  in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications 
the company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown  as this involves the resolution of claims made  or future claims that may be made  against the company  its directors and or officers  the outcomes of which is unknown and not currently predictable

outlook historically  the company has derived approximately one half of its revenues directly from government sources  principally state medicaid programs and to a lesser extent the federal medicare program  and one half from the private sector including individual residents  third party insurers  long term care and other institutional health care facilities and its contract research organization business 
as part of ongoing operations  the company and its customers are subject to regulatory changes in the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
since  congress has passed a number of federal laws that have effected major changes in the healthcare system 
the balanced budget act of the bba sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  changing the reimbursement policies applicable to various healthcare providers 
in an important change for the skilled nursing facility snf industry  the bba provided for the introduction in of the prospective payment system pps for medicare eligible residents of snfs 
prior to pps  snfs under medicare received cost based reimbursement 
under pps  medicare pays snfs a fixed fee per patient per day based upon the acuity level of the resident  covering substantially all items and services furnished during a medicare covered stay  including pharmacy services 
pps resulted in a significant reduction of reimbursement to snfs 
admissions of medicare residents  particularly those requiring complex care  declined in many snfs due to concerns relating to the adequacy of reimbursement under pps 
this caused a weakness in medicare census leading to a significant reduction of overall occupancy in the snfs the company serves 
this decline in occupancy and acuity levels adversely impacted omnicare s results beginning in  as the company experienced lower utilization of omnicare services  coupled with pps related pricing pressure from omnicare s snf customers 
in and  congress sought to restore some of the reductions in reimbursement resulting from pps 
this legislation helped to improve the financial condition of snfs  motivated them to increase admissions  particularly of higher acuity residents  and stabilized the unfavorable operating trends attributable to pps 
one provision gave snfs a temporary rate increase for certain specific high acuity patients beginning april   and ending when centers for medicare medicaid services cms implements a refined patient classification system under pps 
for several years  cms did not implement such refinements  thus continuing the additional rate increase for certain high acuity patients through federal fiscal year on july  cms issued  and on august  published in the federal register  its final snf pps rule for fiscal year under the rule  the cms added nine patient classification categories to the pps patient classification system  thus triggering the expiration of the high acuity payments add ons 
however  cms estimates that the rule will have a slightly positive financial impact on snfs in fiscal year because the billion reduction from the expiration of the add on payments will be more than offset by a million increase in the nursing case mix weight for all of the rug categories and a million increase associated with various updates to the payment rates including updates to the wage and market basket indexes  resulting in a million overall increase in payments for fiscal year the new patient classification refinements became effective on january   and the market basket increase became effective october  while the fiscal year snf pps rates will not decrease payments to snfs  the loss of revenues associated with future changes in snf payments could  in the future  have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf clients which could  in turn  adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
moreover  on february   the president signed into law the deficit reform act dra  which will reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately billion over five years 
among other things  the legislation reduces medicare snf bad debt payments by percent for those individuals who are not dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
this provision is expected to reduce payments to snfs by million over years fiscal years 
further  on february   the bush administration released its fiscal year budget proposal  which would reduce medicare spending by billion in fiscal year and billion over years 
the budget would  among other things  freeze payments to snfs in fiscal year  and limit the payment update to market basket minus percent in fiscal year and to enhance the long term financing of the medicare program  the budget also proposes automatic reductions in provider updates if general revenues are projected to exceed percent of total medicare financing 
while these proposals would require legislation to be implemented  congress may consider these and other proposals in the future that would further restrict medicare funding for snfs 
in december  congress enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma  which includes a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under a new medicare part d  effective january  prior to enrollment in part d  beneficiaries can receive assistance with their outpatient prescription drug costs through a prescription drug discount card program 
this discount card program began in june  and has provided enrollees access to negotiated discounted prices for prescription drugs 
the discount card program ends may under the new part d prescription drug benefit  medicare beneficiaries may enroll in part d plans which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs 
the deadline for part d enrollment for is generally may   although the new benefits became available january  and nursing home residents may enroll at any time 
medicare beneficiaries generally have to pay a premium to enroll in a part d plan  with the premium amount varying from plan to plan  although cms will provide various federal subsidies to part d plans to reduce the cost to beneficiaries 
medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles  including nursing home residents served by the company whose drug costs have been covered by state medicaid programs  now have their prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived from beneficiaries covered under state medicaid programs 
cms provides premium and cost sharing subsidies to part d plans with respect to dual eligible residents of nursing homes 
therefore  such dual eligibles are not required to pay a premium for enrollment in a part d plan  so long as the premium for the part d plan in which they are enrolled is at or below the premium subsidy  nor are they required to meet deductibles or pay co payment amounts 
further  all dual eligibles who had not affirmatively enrolled in a part d plan as of december  were automatically enrolled into a pdp by cms on a random basis from among those pdps meeting cms criteria for low income premiums in the pdp region 
as is the case for any nursing home beneficiary  such dual eligible beneficiaries may change part d plans at any time through the established part d enrollment process 
in sum  dual eligible residents of nursing homes are entitled to have their prescription drug costs covered by a part d plan  provided that the prescription drugs which they are taking are either on the part d plan s formulary  or an exception to the plan s formulary is granted 
cms requires the formularies of part d plans to include the types of drugs most commonly needed by medicare beneficiaries  and that plans formulary exceptions criteria provide for coverage of drugs determined by the plan to be medically appropriate for the enrollee 
the mma also makes available partial premium and cost sharing subsidies for certain other classes of low income enrollees who do not qualify for medicaid 
pursuant to the final part d rule  we will obtain reimbursement for drugs we provide to enrollees of a given part d plan in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated between us and that part d plan 
we have negotiated such agreements with most part d plan sponsors under which we will provide drugs and associated services to their enrollees 
we continue to negotiate agreements with part d plans 
moreover  as expected in the transition to a new program of this magnitude  certain administrative and payment issues have arisen 
until all such agreements are finalized and medicare beneficiaries complete enrollment in the plans  and until the administrative and payment issues have been resolved  we will not be able to determine the impact of the new part d drug benefit on the company s results of operation or financial condition 
the mma does not change the manner in which medicare pays for drugs for medicare beneficiaries covered under a medicare part a stay 
we will continue to receive reimbursement for drugs provided to such residents from the snfs pursuant to the contracts we have negotiated with each snf 
cms has issued subregulatory guidance on many aspects of the final part d rule including the provision of pharmacy services to long term care residents 
cms has also expressed some concerns about pharmacies receipt of discounts  rebates and other price concessions from drug manufacturers 
specifically  cms has stated that while such rebates are not prohibited  they could create significant fraud and abuse concerns 
cms has proposed in draft form a requirement for pharmacies to disclose to the part d plan sponsor any discounts  rebates and other direct or indirect remuneration designed to directly or indirectly influence or impact utilization of part d drugs  and that certain rebates provided to long term care pharmacies would need to be netted out of the plans costs for purposes of certain part d subsidy calculations 
cms has indicated it will continue to issue guidance on the part d program as it is implemented 
we are continuing to monitor implementation of the new part d benefit  and until further agency guidance is known and until the administrative and payment issues associated with the transition to this massive program have been resolved  we cannot predict the ultimate effect of the final rule or the outcome of other potential developments related to its implementation on our business or results of operations 
the mma also reforms the medicare part b prescription drug payment methodology  although the company s revenues for drugs dispensed under medicare part b are not significant in comparison to total revenues 
the mma also includes administrative reforms designed to improve medicare program operations 
it is uncertain at this time the impact that the mma s legislative reforms ultimately will have on the company 
other healthcare funding issues remain  including pressures on federal and state medicaid budgets  and most states are taking steps to implement cost controls within their medicaid programs 
some states continue to experience budget shortfalls  which may prompt them to consider implementing reductions in medicaid reimbursement and other cost control measures 
likewise  the dra includes several changes to the medicaid program designed to rein in program spending 
these include  among others  strengthening the medicaid asset transfer restrictions for persons seeking to qualify for medicaid long term care coverage  which could  due to the timing of the penalty period  increase facilities exposure to uncompensated care 
this provision is expected to reduce medicaid spending by an estimated billion over years 
the law also gives states greater flexibility to expand access to home and community based services by allowing states to provide these services as an optional benefit without undergoing the waiver approval process  and includes a new demonstration to encourage states to provide long term care services in a community setting to individuals who currently receive medicaid services in nursing homes 
together these provisions could increase state funding for home and community based services  while prompting states to cut funding for nursing facilities 
the dra also changes the so called medicaid upper limit rules for prescription drugs  effective january  like the current upper limit  it only applies to drug s ingredient costs and does not include dispensing fees  which will continue to be determined by the states 
with the advent of medicare part d  our revenue from state medicaid programs will be substantially less than has been the case previously 
however  some of our agreements with part d plans have incorporated the medicaid upper limit rules into the pricing mechanisms for our prescription drugs 
in addition  the president s proposed fiscal year budget includes a series of proposals impacting medicaid and the state children s health insurance program schip  including administrative changes to the financing structure of medicaid that would save more than billion over five years 
these changes include further reductions in medicaid drug reimbursement  reforms to medicaid drug rebate requirements  allowing states to use managed drug formularies  and reforms to medicaid provider taxes 
while the company has endeavored to adjust to these types of funding pressures in the past  there can be no assurance that these or future changes in medicaid payments to nursing facilities  pharmacies  or managed care systems  or their potential impact on payments under agreements with part d plans  will not have an adverse impact on the company s business 
longer term  funding for federal and state healthcare programs must consider the aging of the population and the growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the introduction of new  more efficacious but also more expensive medications  and the long term financing of the medicare and medicaid programs 
given competing national priorities  it remains difficult to predict the outcome and impact on the company of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicare and medicaid programs 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one that is able to improve the quality of life 
further  the pace and quality of new drug development is yielding many promising new drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly 
these new drugs may be more expensive than older  less effective drug therapies due to rising research costs 
however  they are significantly more effective in curing or ameliorating illness and in lowering overall healthcare costs by reducing  among other things  hospitalizations  physician visits  nursing time and lab tests 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company anticipates that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it is not possible to predict the effect of the new medicare part d drug benefit or any further initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment 
further  while volatility can occur from time to time in the contract research business owing to factors such as the success or failure of its clients compounds  the timing or budgetary constraints of its clients  or consolidation within our client base  new drug discovery remains an important priority of drug manufacturers 
drug manufacturers  in order to optimize their research and development efforts  will continue to turn to contract research organizations to assist them in accelerating drug research development and commercialization
