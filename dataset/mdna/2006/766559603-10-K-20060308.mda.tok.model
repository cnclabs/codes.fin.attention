item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rigel is a clinical stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel  small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases  cancer and viral diseases 
our goal is to move one new product candidate for a significant indication into the clinic each year 
we have achieved this goal each year beginning in our research focuses on intracellular signaling pathways and related targets that are critical to disease mechanisms 
our productivity has resulted in strategic collaborations with large pharmaceutical partners to discover  develop and market our product candidates 
we have product development programs in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  thrombocytopenia  asthma and allergy as well as in cancer 
since  we have matured into a clinical stage drug development company with multiple product candidates in development as follows r product candidate for rheumatoid arthritis 
r  an oral solid dosage formulation of r  is our lead product candidate 
it has a novel mechanism of action blocking igg receptor signaling in macrophages and b cells 
previously  we studied r in a phase i single center  double blind  randomized  placebo controlled trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating single and multiple doses of r we are now studying r safety and pharmacokinetics in combination with methotrexate  a commonly prescribed treatment for ra 
preliminary analysis of the results of this trial suggests no adverse interaction 
we expect to commence phase ii efficacy studies for ra in the second half of itp program 
platelet destruction from itp is mediated by igg signaling 
r is a potent inhibitor of igg signaling 
in preclinical studies  rigel has shown r to improve thrombocytopenia in an itp mouse model 
we plan to commence phase ii clinical trials of r to evaluate its safety and efficacy in refractory itp patients in the second half of r product candidate for oncology 
in july  we identified r as a lead compound in our aurora kinase inhibition program  targeting cancer cell proliferation 
r is a potent  highly selective  small molecule inhibitor of aurora kinase 
in october  we signed a licensing agreement with serono that grants to serono an exclusive license to develop and commercialize r  in addition to other product candidates arising from our aurora kinase inhibitor program 
under the agreement  we were responsible for filing an ind for r while serono will be responsible for the further development and commercialization of r we filed the ind for r with the food and drug administration  or fda  in december  and obtained fda approval to proceed under the ind in january during february  we received a milestone payment of million triggered by the regulatory acceptance 
we anticipate that serono will initiate clinical trials for r by in the first half of in the first quarter of  we announced that we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer for the development of inhaled products for the treatment of allergic asthma and other respiratory diseases  such as copd 
the collaboration is focused on our preclinical small molecule compounds  which inhibit ige receptor signaling in respiratory tract mast cells by blocking the signaling enzyme syk  or spleen tyrosine kinase  a novel drug target for respiratory diseases 
mast cells play important roles in both early and late phase allergic reactions  and syk inhibitors could prevent both phases 
we expect pfizer to advance a compound to the clinic combining their dry powder inhaler  their drug development capabilities and our novel small molecules 
the first significant milestone under this collaboration is pfizer s selection of a specific molecule to take into drug development  which we expect to occur in in december  we announced that r  our clinical candidate for allergic rhinitis  failed to achieve its primary endpoint in a multi center phase ii clinical trial in december we are not planning to move r forward in clinical development 
we are currently evaluating alternatives on how to best proceed with our allergic rhinitis program either on our own with backup compound or with a collaborative partner 
in july  we announced that we will undertake the study of other chemical scaffolds in our hepatitis c virus program because preliminary findings from pre clinical studies of a pro drug of r showed insufficient support to move forward 
we expect to bring these alternate scaffolds into pre clinical studies in in addition to the above mentioned product candidates  we have ongoing research programs involving back up candidates for the product candidates discussed above as well as drug discovery efforts in our immunology inflammation  virology and oncology programs 
corporate collaborations we carry on research and development programs in connection with our corporate collaborations 
as of december   we have collaborations with six major pharmaceutical biotech companies comprised of one with janssen pharmaceutica nv  a division of johnson johnson  relating to oncology therapeutics and diagnostics  two with pfizer inc  one initiated in and the other in the first quarter of  relating to intrapulmonary asthma and allergy therapeutics  one with novartis pharma ag with respect to four different programs relating to immunology  oncology and chronic bronchitis  one with daiichi pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
in the area of oncology  one with merck  in the area of oncology  and one with serono in the area of oncology 
all of these collaborations  excluding the recent pfizer and the serono collaborations  have a research phase during which we receive or received funding based on the level of headcount allocated to a program 
in all of these collaborations if certain conditions are met  we are entitled to receive future milestone payments and royalties 
we cannot guarantee that these conditions will be met or that research and development efforts will be successful 
as a result  we may be precluded from receiving any milestone payments or royalties under these agreements 
only the merck program currently provides for regular research reimbursement payments as the research phase of the daiichi collaboration ended in august we are exploring new opportunities with existing and potential collaborators 
our earliest partnerships focused on the early stages of drug discovery  specifically on target discovery and validation 
our collaborations with daiichi and recently with merck are both later stage focusing on drug discovery and development 
our collaboration with pfizer covers compounds at the preclinical and lead designation stages while our collaboration with serono covers a compound for which an ind was filed in december and obtained fda approval in january we currently anticipate that in order to support our current research programs we will need to self fund our own research programs  which involve an increased rate of spending  to later stages of development prior to partnering with collaborative partners 
therefore  it is expected that future collaborations may have an expanded focus and could include high throughput screening  combinatorial and medicinal chemistry  preclinical evaluations and or clinical development of compounds we have discovered 
in addition  we believe these future collaborations could be structured to consist of upfront payments  the purchase of our common stock  milestone payments upon meeting certain conditions  research or development reimbursement payments and or royalties upon commercialization of products resulting from the collaboration 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of the research collaborations  investments  stock compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our contract arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
revenues related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements  except for the merck collaboration signed in november related to ubiquitin ligases approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
for the merck collaboration  we are recognizing a pro rata portion of the invoiced amounts for funding of our research scientists based on the headcount dedicated to the project 
it is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort expended  however  revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the arrangement which corresponds to cash receipts 
milestones are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of at risk milestones 
royalties will be recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands stock based compensation recovery expense from re priced options consultant options other employee options total re priced options we have recorded expenses associated with the stock options that were eligible for re pricing under a tender offer initiated in june all replacement options  as well as the eligible options that were not surrendered under the original offer to exchange  have been treated for financial reporting purposes as variable awards 
therefore  we have recorded a non cash charge recovery  generally for the intrinsic value of the options as they vest  utilizing the graded vesting method  reflecting increases and decreases down to  but not below  the exercise price in the price of our common stock as compensation expense recovery in connection with the replacement options and the eligible options that were not exchanged 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash compensation recovery of million related to all options eligible for the replacement 
the recovery resulted from the decrease in the market price of our common stock during for the years ended december  and  we recorded non cash compensation charges of million and million  respectively  related to all options eligible for the replacement 
the amounts recorded were attributable to the increases in the market price of our common stock during the respective years 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas r  share based payment revised  which replaces sfas and supercedes apb from the first quarter of fiscal year  we will be required to adopt sfas r and measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value based method and record the share based compensation expenses in our statements of operations if the requisite service to earn the award is provided 
we are currently finalizing our methodology for implementing fas r and expect the adoption of sfas r  sab and related pronouncements will have a material impact on our results of operations 
consultant options we also record expenses associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the periodic revaluation of outstanding unvested consultant options based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price 
we recognized stock based compensation recovery for revaluation of consultant options of  for the year ended december  and stock based compensation expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other employee options we recorded no deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees for the year ended december  we recorded  of deferred stock compensation for the year ended december  we recorded no deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees for the year ended december  the amount recorded in related to an option grant to a certain executive officer that was modified to reduce the vesting term 
this amount has been reflected as a component of stockholders equity  and the deferred expense is being amortized to operations over the remaining vesting period of the option grant using the graded vesting method 
as a result of our reduction in force on january   we recognized approximately  of stock based compensation recovery associated with the unvested and cancelled options of the terminated employees which had previously been recognized under the graded vesting method of deferred compensation amortization 
we amortized deferred stock compensation of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had a total of  remaining to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands contract revenues from collaborations revenues by collaborator were years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands merck pfizer serono daiichi novartis johnson johnson total contract revenues from collaborations in  and consisted primarily of research support and amortization of upfront fees from the continuation of our collaborations above 
revenues for and also included milestone payments from certain collaborators 
in the twelve months ended december   revenues included a  milestone payment from daiichi  which primarily related to the acceptance by daiichi of two compounds to move toward pre clinical testing and a  milestone for merck related to a certain ligase target 
the increase in revenues in from was primarily due to a full year of the merck collaboration and the initiation of the pfizer and serono collaborations  offset by the termination of the research phase of the novartis oncology program in the decrease in from revenues was primarily due to the termination of the research phase of the novartis oncology program and the termination of the research phase of the johnson johnson oncology program 
also  revenues in included a million milestone payment from daiichi for the completion of a certain screening phase of the collaboration 
the research phase of the daiichi collaboration ended in august while the research phase of the merck collaboration ends in may we expect contract revenues from collaborations to continue to be a significant component of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
research and development years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands research and development expenses stock based compensation recovery expense included in research and development expenses the increase in research and development expenses in was due to the increase in our preclinical and clinical costs and personnel costs offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to the re priced stock options subject to variable accounting  as discussed previously under stock based compensation in the critical accounting policies and the use of estimates section 
the increase in our preclinical and clinical costs for twelve months ended december was attributable to costs associated with our r  r and r programs offset by the decrease in costs associated with our r program  which was discontinued in july the costs attributable to r were related to our ongoing clinical trials as well as the ind enabling studies 
the costs associated with r were related to the ongoing ind enabling studies  as well as the production of material for the upcoming clinical trials 
the costs associated with r were related to clinical costs for the phase ii study initiated in august the increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily attributable to an increase in our preclinical and clinical costs and a stock based compensation expense charge related to the re priced stock options subject to variable accounting  as discussed previously under stock based compensation in the critical accounting policies and the use of estimates section 
the increase in our clinical costs in was attributable to costs associated with our phase ii clinical trial for r  our phase i ii clinical trial for r  and our phase i clinical trial for r the increase in our pre clinical costs in was primarily attributable to the studies performed with r to enable the initiation of clinical trials in december the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development therefore results in increasing expenditures 
our research and development expenditures currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands general and administrative expenses stock based compensation recovery expense included in general and administrative expenses the decrease in administrative expenses in from was primarily due to the decrease of stock based compensation expense related to the re priced stock options subject to variable accounting  as discussed previously under stock based compensation in the critical accounting policies and the use of estimates section offset by increased personnel and facility costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in from million in was primarily attributable to an increase in our intellectual property legal costs to expand our patent estate  an increase in our stock based compensation expense charge related to the re priced stock options subject to variable accounting  as discussed previously under stock based compensation in the critical accounting policies and the use of estimates section  and an increase in personnel related costs 
loss on disposal sale of property and equipment years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands loss on disposal sale of property and equipment during  we wrote off  of assets at their original acquisition cost and related accumulated depreciation of  for assets that are no longer in use 
we recorded loss on disposal of property and equipment of  in conjunction with our move to our new facilities in february  we sold to the new tenant of our previous facility certain furniture and equipment that would no longer be needed at our new location 
this sale resulted in cash proceeds of approximately  and a loss on sale of  the loss represents the remaining net book value of those assets net of the cash received on the sale 
interest income years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands interest income interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances 
the increase in interest income in from was primarily due to the increase in our investment balances as a result of the public offering we completed in july where we raised million in net proceeds combined with an increase in the interest rates we earn on these balances 
the increase in interest income in from was primarily due to the increase in our investment balances as a result of the follow on offering completed in early interest expense years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands interest expense interest expense is the result of our capital lease obligations associated with fixed asset acquisitions 
interest expense was flat in as compared to due to comparable debt obligations outstanding during both years 
the decrease in interest expense in from was due to the decrease in debt obligations 
future accounting requirements in november  fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp fas also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp fas is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are required to adopt fsp fas in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial condition 
in may  fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  fasb issued sfas r  share based payment revised  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
in april  the sec issued amendment to rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment the amendment to rule a  changing the effective date for most public companies to adopt sfas r to the first interim reporting period of a company s fiscal year that begins on or after june  under the amendment to rule a  we are now required to adopt sfas r in our first quarter of fiscal year sfas r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expense in the financial statements 
sfas r also provides three alternative transition methods for its first adoption 
up to the end of fiscal year  we had measured compensation costs related to share based payments under apb and as allowed by sfas  and provided pro forma disclosure in notes to our financial statements as required by sfas on adoption of sfas r  we will use the modified prospective application transition method 
sfas r also requires a classification change in the statement of cash flows  whereby a portion of the tax benefits from stock options will be moved from cash from operating activities to cash from financing activities  without changing the total cash flows 
we are currently finalizing the methodology for implementing fas r and expect the adoption of sfas r  sab and related pronouncements will have a material impact on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments payable to us under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date  and operating expenditures are expected to increase over the next several years 
in july  we completed a public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock  including  shares issued upon exercise of an option granted to the underwriters to cover over allotments  at a price to the public of per share  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses 
in october  we signed a licensing agreement with serono where we received initial payments totaling million comprised of a license fee of million and the purchase of million of our common stock at a premium 
in january  we signed a licensing agreement with pfizer where we received initial payments totaling million comprised of a license fee of million and the purchase of million of our common stock at a premium 
we believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated proceeds from current collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through at least the next months 
our operations will require significant additional funding in large part due to our research and development expenses  future preclinical and clinical testing costs  and the absence of any meaningful revenues for the foreseeable future 
the amount of future funds needed will depend largely on the timing and structure of potential future collaborations 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date  and operating expenditures are expected to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure and research and development activities 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders could at that time experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend on many uncertain factors 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of preclinical activities including studies and manufacture of materials and clinical trials of our product candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to establish new collaborations and to maintain our existing collaboration partnerships  the progress of research programs carried out by us  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborative partners  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and filings by us and our collaborators  and expenses associated with unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to net proceeds of million  after deducting offering costs  from the follow on offering completed in july and proceeds from the sale of our common stock from collaborative arrangements with serono and pfizer offset by our operating spending for the year 
we also received million under our equipment financing arrangements  which was offset by debt service payments of million relating to the equipment financing arrangements 
for the years ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  federal agency securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
contractual obligations the following are our contractual commitments by fiscal year as of december  associated with debt obligations  contracted research obligations  and lease obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt obligations contracted research facilities lease  net of sublease total as of december   we had million in debt obligations associated with our equipment additions 
all existing debt agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at rates in a range of to and are due in monthly installments through during may  we initiated a sublease of approximately  square feet of our premises to a tenant for a period of two years 
the sublease was amended in september to extend term for an additional year 
the facilities lease obligations above are reflective of the sublease income stream of approximately  the payments above also reflect the remaining twelve years of the lease term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  federal agency securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
