item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we focus on several key metrics in managing and evaluating our operating performance and financial condition including the following comparable store sales  sales by merchandise categories  gross profit  operating costs as a percentage of sales  cash flow  total debt to total capital  and earnings per share 
our sales are generated by customer purchases of home furnishings in our retail stores and recorded as revenue when delivered to the customer 
there is typically a two week lag between the time when a customer s order is placed in one of our stores and the time when the customer is able to arrange their schedule for delivery 
comparable store or comp store sales are comparisons of sales results of stores that have been open at least one year 
as a retailer this performance measure is an indicator of relative customer spending period over period 
havertys cost of sales includes only the costs associated with the sourcing of our products 
our gross profit is primarily dependent upon merchandising capabilities  vendor pricing and the mix of products sold 
the success of our havertys brands has continued since their introduction at the end of and these products have been expanded as a percentage of our overall sales mix 
the introduction of havertys premium collections during was an important step in establishing the havertys brand in all product categories 
we view the sourcing of the values associated with imported product offerings and the mix of our merchandise as important opportunities for improving our performance 
our operational focus during the past few years has been our warehouse and delivery effectiveness as we completely revamped our distribution methodology and consolidated certain customer service functions 
this created redundant operations and increased inventory markdowns during the transition periods in the affected markets 
we completed the transformation and consolidation of our distribution systems in the second quarter of 
table of contents the growing percentage of imported products from asia and the increased havertys brands merchandise are significant changes in our industry and our business within a very short time frame 
the longer lead times required for delivery from the factories and the production of merchandise exclusively for havertys have been analyzed by our supply chain team 
we are expanding the storage capacity of our eastern dc to store imported goods for our eastern growth and move into the midwest 
additionally it will help us supplement the product flow from key domestic upholstery suppliers for the florida region 
we are continuing our direct importing program initiative  with a focus on china and asia 
our main strategy is to work with a select number of experienced manufacturers and to become important customers to these suppliers 
we realize that there are increased risks in direct importing and therefore we are moving at a deliberate and measured pace 
cash flows continued to be strong during  providing funding for million in new property and equipment expenditures  and the reduction of debt by million 
our cash flow accelerated during  in part due to the outsourcing of certain credit promotions to a third party finance company  and those programs have now reached a fairly level state 
the increased cash enabled us to repay all of our fixed rate debt that did not have significant pre payment penalties 
we have continued to improve our financial leverage and our total debt to total capital decreased from at december  to at december  critical accounting estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets and facility closing costs  pension and retirement benefits and self insurance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts using a method that considers the balances in problem and delinquent categories  historical write offs and judgment 
delinquent accounts are generally written off automatically after the passage of nine months without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of a discharged bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collections unlikely 
we assess the adequacy of the allowance at the end of each quarter 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded provisions for bad debts of million 
million and million  respectively 
as of december   and  our gross receivables of million in each year  had reserves of million and million  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts 
table of contents as a percentage of the receivables pool is lower in due to improvements in the delinquency and problem category percentages from and while our customer base is large and geographically dispersed  a general economic downturn affecting our target customers could result in higher than expected defaults  and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and is reasonable in light of portfolio balance  portfolio quality  historical charge offs and reasonable charge off forecasts 
we make available to customers interest free credit programs  which range from to months 
in connection with these programs which are greater than months  we are required to discount payments to be received over the life of the interest free credit program 
on the basis of the credit worthiness of the customers and our low delinquency rates under these programs  we discount the receivables utilizing the prime rate of interest at the date of sale 
the discount is recorded as a contra receivable and is amortized to net interest expense over the life of the receivable 
the discount on the receivables is adjusted for prepayment at the time of prepayment 
there is no assumption for prepayment recorded at inception 
if delinquency rates under these interest free programs deteriorate  we may adjust the rate at which we discount such receivables in the future 
the unamortized discounts were  and  at december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets and facility closing costs 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we group and evaluate long lived assets for impairment at the market area level  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
when evaluating these assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying amount of the asset to the market area s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss calculation is prepared 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset to the market area s assets estimated fair value  which is determined on the basis of future cash flows discounted and with interest charges  or market value 
if required  an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset s carrying value that exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
we account for closed store and warehouse lease termination costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
as such  in the period we close a store or warehouse  we record as an obligation the present value of estimated costs that will not be recovered 
these costs include any estimated loss on the sale of the land and buildings  the book value of any abandoned leasehold improvements and amounts for future lease payments  less any estimated sublease income 
at december  and  our reserve for impairment of long lived assets and facility closing costs totaled  and  respectively 
in the future  these costs could increase or decrease based upon general economic conditions  economic conditions in specific markets including the impact of new competition  the fair market value of owned properties  our ability to sublease facilities and the accuracy of our related estimates 
pension and retirement benefits 
pension and other retirement plans costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension and retirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for the company s future pension and retirement benefit obligations 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences between assumed and actual experience may affect the company s operating results 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased expense for the defined benefit pension plan by approximately million  a change and a one percentage point increase would have decreased expense by million  a change 
a one percentage point change in the expected return on plan assets would impact expense for the defined benefit pension plan by approximately million  a change 
in addition  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

table of contents self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to worker s compensation  general liability and vehicle claims 
our reserve is developed based on historical claims data and contains an actuarially developed incurred but not reported component 
the resulting estimate is discounted and recorded as a liability 
our actuarial assumptions and discount rates are reviewed periodically and compared with actual claims experience and external benchmarks to ensure that our methodology and assumptions are appropriate 
a one percentage point change in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact expense for insurance by approximately  a change 
operating results the following table sets forth for the periods indicated i selected statement of income data  expressed as a percentage of net sales and ii the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of income data percentage change in dollars percentage of net sales from prior year net sales cost of sales gross profit credit service charge revenue provision for doubtful accounts selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes net income comparable basis cost of sales  on a comparable basis gross profit  on a comparable basis selling  general and administrative expenses  on a comparable basis cost of sales  gross profit and sg a expenses prior to have been adjusted for the reclassification of handling and transportation costs into cost of goods sold see note to our consolidated financial statements 
excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  cost of sales  gross profit and sg a expenses in have been adjusted from the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the amount for has been adjusted by million for the treatment of vendor rebates and advertising allowances so that they are comparable to the treatment in and we believe this non gaap presentation is meaningful because without presenting on a comparable basis to other years presented  our gross profit would appear to have increased significantly 
conversely  sg a costs would appear to have increased significantly 
however  on a gaap basis these changes are primarily due to the required classification of vendor rebates and allowances as a reduction of inventory costs and a resulting reduction in cost of sales  whereas in and prior years such amounts were included as a reduction of sg a costs 

table of contents net sales total sales increased million or in and million or in  respectively 
comparable store sales rose or million in and or million in the remaining million and million of the increases in and  respectively  were from new and otherwise non comparable stores  partially offset by the loss of sales from stores closed 
stores are considered non comparable if open for less than full calendar months or if the selling square footage has been changed significantly during the past full calendar months 
large clearance sales events from warehouses or temporary locations are also excluded from comparable store sales  as are periods when stores are closed or being remodeled 
the following outlines our sales and comp store sales increases for the periods indicated dollars in millions year ended december  comp store comp store comp store net sales sales net sales sales net sales sales increase increase increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease decrease period dollars over prior over prior dollars over prior over prior dollars over prior over prior ended s period period s period period s period period ql q q q year retail sales of big ticket home goods were weak from mid to mid  which was widely reported to be due to consumer anxiety about employment uncertainty  threats of war  war and geopolitical unrest 
there was also a lingering negative effect from lower stock market values 
beginning in june we had positive comp store monthly sales results that continued throughout the remainder of and through april excluding november  which was negative 
sales in our florida and southeast markets during august and september of were negatively impacted by record breaking severe weather from four hurricanes in a six week period 
these lost sales were particularly significant because our florida stores normally produce approximately of our total sales 
during october  we experienced some delays in receiving product from asia and began building a backlog of undelivered orders faster than our historical rates 
the backlog remained higher than the prior year s level at the end of as strong sales activity during november and december kept the order rate ahead of our deliveries 
sales in the first half of improved but still reflected some reluctance by consumers to make big ticket purchases 
we believe that sales for big ticket furniture items during the third quarter of were hampered by a number of factors including rising fuel costs  continued negative impressions concerning the economy  and heavy promotional activity by the automobile industry 
we did not experience a significant direct impact from hurricane katrina but the fourth quarter of was affected as general consumer morale was battered by gas price spikes above per gallon  higher home heating bills and rising interest rates 
our sales during increased across all major categories of furnishings  with sleeper sofas and dining categories performing better than the average 
our average sales transaction and price per item both remained modestly higher over the prior year periods 
we believe that continued strong housing sales and demographic trends are a positive factor for the industry  but consumer confidence and further indications of a strengthening economy are key to increased spending for big ticket 
table of contents furniture items 
many retailers have been advertising aggressive sales promotions to stimulate business and increase their sales volume 
we believe that this approach would negatively impact our everyday low pricing integrity with our customers over the longer term 
we have instead used some promotional pricing during traditional sales events 
supplementing the pricing promotions  we also offer free interest and deferred payment financing promotions 
we expect to continue this approach of providing a selection of specially priced merchandise and financing promotions to increase traffic in our stores 
during  we will offer financing promotions with longer deferred interest periods 
we will also draw from the positive results of our first page catalog mailed in october  with improved versions and varied target mailing techniques 
gross profit cost of sales consists primarily of the purchase price of the merchandise together with certain handling and transportation costs 
our gross profit is largely dependent upon merchandising and warehousing capabilities  vendor pricing  transportation costs and the mix of products sold 
we have developed strong relationships with our suppliers and believe that we receive excellent pricing and service from our key vendors due to the volume and reliability of our purchase commitments 
the continued improvements related to the products imported from asia and pricing pressure on domestic suppliers have also generated good values for us 
many retailers have used the decreased costs to support their heavy promotional pricing 
our approach has been to offer products with greater value at our established middle to upper middle price points 
gross profit for decreased basis points to from in our gross profit was negatively impacted by increased transportation costs included in cost of goods sold 
transportation costs increased million in over or basis points of net sales 
this expense varies with sales volume  and demonstrates the comparative increase in expense related to moving goods through a more centralized distribution infrastructure and the additional miles which must be driven given the reduction in warehouses in our current model 
handling costs increased million in over or basis points of net sales as more merchandise flowed through our dcs 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced fluctuations in our product flow and capacity issues in our distribution centers 
to create additional warehouse capacity  we reduced selling prices on certain merchandise in our lifo reserve increased during and negatively impacted gross profit by approximately basis points 
gross profit for decreased basis points to from in  on a comparable basis 
our gross profit was negatively impacted by a basis points increase in transportation and handling costs and an additional basis points negative impact from an increase in the lifo reserve 
inventory close outs were higher during as compared to as we closed and consolidated warehouses 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  as some of our competitors struggled and aggressively offered heavy discounts  we were compelled to match prices on identical or similar products in several of our markets 
our core furniture merchandise comprises approximately of the furniture items  excluding bedding and accessories  which we carry in all of our stores 
additional products that are more regionally focused and items needed to merchandise our larger retail stores supplement the core furniture merchandise assortment 
imported products comprised approximately of our core merchandise groups at december   and increased to approximately by the end of as new products were received and displayed in our showrooms 
wood products  or case goods  are generally imported  with only of our selected case goods at december   produced domestically 
upholstered items are not as heavily imported  with the exception of our leather products  of which almost were imported during the havertys branded lines are approximately imported with virtually all case goods and leather items being imported 
we believe for the selected imported items we purchase  we achieve substantial savings as compared to similar domestically made products 

table of contents our proprietary havertys branded merchandise produced modestly higher gross margins compared to the other products we offered and havertys brands margins continued to increase on a year over year basis 
during  we began purchasing a small level of products working directly with foreign manufacturers 
we believe that  although there are savings in the direct import approach to sourcing our goods  there are also associated risks with quality and customer acceptance 
our merchandising team has selected an experienced quality control firm that is dedicated to inspecting product produced for havertys 
we are also using design firms to complement our merchandising team s skills to develop our proprietary havertys products 
similar to our careful introduction of the first havertys branded products  we will continue to move judiciously on a direct import program 
the selected vendors that provide us with their branded goods remain important suppliers to us 
their products have wide customer acceptance and we are also working with several of these manufacturers developing product that carries their brand but will be exclusive to havertys 
we believe that the combination of these types of arrangements and our proprietary havertys branded products will provide our customers with an excellent selection of merchandise at attractive prices and yield improving margins for havertys 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of five categories selling  occupancy  delivery  certain warehouse costs  advertising and administrative 
selling expenses primarily are comprised of compensation of sales associates and sales support staff  and fees paid to credit card and third party finance companies 
occupancy costs include rents  depreciation charges  insurance and property taxes  repairs and maintenance expenses and utility costs 
delivery costs include personnel  fuel costs  and depreciation and rental charges for rolling stock 
warehouse costs include demurrage  supplies  depreciation and rental charges for equipment 
advertising expenses are primarily media production and space  direct mail costs  market research expenses and employee compensation 
administrative expenses are comprised of compensation costs for store management  information systems  executive  finance  merchandising  supply chain  real estate and human resource departments 
our sg a costs were negatively impacted by several factors in total sg a costs  as a percentage of net sales were for as compared to and  on a comparable basis  in and  respectively 
selling expenses generally vary with sales volume 
we experienced additional increases in over mainly due to our customers increased use of credit cards when purchasing and accordingly our bank card fees rose 
this increased usage continued during but at less than half the rate of increase as in occupancy expenses increased million in over or basis points of sales 
our utility costs increased basis points and depreciation expense was up basis points on a year over year basis 
we also had higher local property tax rates in certain jurisdictions and repairs to certain sites from hurricane damage in the gulf coast area 
occupancy expenses increased million in over and were relatively flat as a percentage of sales 
we developed our distribution system to accommodate store expansion and sales growth 
the shift from local market warehouses to our more centralized system caused us to change how we classified our warehousing and transportation costs 
we have historically capitalized certain expenses related to handling and transportation of merchandise to the local markets into inventory which flows through the distribution centers or in prior years  the regional warehouses 
in prior periods  expenditures capitalized into inventory were recognized through sg a rather than cost of goods sold 
our current distribution model flows a majority of inventory through the dcs 
accordingly  we now include those costs capitalized into inventory for handling and transportation in cost of goods 
table of contents sold and have reclassified the prior periods for comparability 
these costs which are now included in cost of goods sold were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this is a change only in the classification of these expenses in our consolidated statements of income and has no impact on earnings  valuation of inventory or cash flows 
warehouse expenses increased million in over  or basis points of net sales 
demurrage fees  which were virtually zero in  were million in because of supply chain difficulties 
the ocean and inter modal carriers charge demurrage fees when containers carrying imported merchandise are not unloaded and returned to the port within the carriers prescribed time periods 
warehouse compensation and benefits increased as we absorbed duplicate costs during the conversion from the florida regional warehouse and local market warehouses to the florida dc  incurred separation expenses for local warehouse employees and increased compensation expense at our larger dcs for anticipated sales volume increases 
warehouse operating expenses increased million due to higher requirements of demountable shipping supplies wrap  pads  ties  blankets  etc to ship a higher proportion of goods in a prepped mode 
warehouse expenses increased only moderately in over  predominately occurring in the fourth quarter of due to facility closings and startup costs associated with the distribution transition 
our imports have increased considerably in the past few years and our distribution centers were not large enough to accommodate the product flow for the breadth of our line up 
a significant expansion of our eastern dc is underway 
the first phase is complete and we began using that space during january and the second phase will be completed in april 
this expansion should enable us to better handle the normal fluctuations in business and increase our peak throughput capacity 
we are also improving our supply chain techniques  systems  and controls surrounding our freight service provider and vendor deliveries 
our expansive product line is being pared down to better fit our migration to higher levels of imports 
these changes are expected to eliminate demurrage costs and to allow for more prompt and accurately scheduled deliveries to our customers 
delivery costs increased million in over or basis points of net sales 
delivery compensation increased million over the period  largely related to increases in delivery personnel to service new markets as well as reassignment of personnel from shuttered warehouses to delivery roles 
delivery fuel costs have also risen due to higher fuel prices and more delivered sale volume 
delivery costs increased in relative to by approximately basis points as a percentage of net sales primarily due to increases in delivery personnel to service new markets 
we increased our advertising dollars during by million as we continued to build our havertys brand image with our target customers 
we printed and distributed our first page catalog to target customers and we are building on its success 
we reduced our newspaper and direct mail costs slightly and shifted advertising dollars to television and our more targeted advertising programs such as the catalog and tabloids 
our costs associated with television advertising increased over from to as we used this media form in our larger and new markets 
total advertising costs as a percentage of sales were  and for  and  respectively 
our administrative costs declined modestly as a percentage of sales for as compared to administrative expenses increased in due to the following additional costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  installation and conversion to our new accounting software package and costs associated with the research and analysis of prospective new real estate markets and locations 

table of contents credit service charge revenue and allowance for doubtful accounts our credit service charge revenue has continued to decline as customers choose credit promotions with no interest features 
the standard outsourced programs offer deferred payment for days  or for larger purchases  for to months  with an interest accrual that is waived if the entire balance is paid in full by the end of the deferral period 
the to months deferred payment promotions were the most popular of all the credit programs offered through the third party finance company and were also used more than any program offered by havertys credit during no interest programs requiring equal monthly payments from to months became the most frequently used in the following highlights the impact these changes have had on our credit service charge revenue and related accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts dollars in thousands year ended december  credit service charge revenue amount financed as a of sales havertys third party financed by havertys no interest for months no interest for months no interest for months other year ended december  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts allowance as a of accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts has declined during the three year period as lower levels of in house receivables were generated 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the receivables pool is lower at the end of due to improvements in the delinquency and problem category percentages versus and 
table of contents interest expense  net interest expense  net is primarily comprised of interest expense on the company s debt and the amortization of the discount on the company s receivables which have deferred or no interest payment terms 
the following table summarizes the components of interest expense  net in thousands year ended december  interest expense on debt amortization of discount on accounts receivable other  including capitalized interest and interest income interest expense on debt decreased in as average debt decreased and the effective interest rate was relatively unchanged 
average debt decreased in but this was offset by an increase in our effective interest rate of basis points as we utilized the revolving credit facilities less in we make available to customers interest free credit programs  which range from to months 
in connection with these programs which are greater than months  we are required to discount the payments to be received over the life of the interest free credit program 
on the basis of the credit worthiness of the customers and our low delinquency rates under these programs  we discount the receivables utilizing the prime rate of interest at the date of sale 
the discount is recorded as a contra receivable and is amortized to net interest expense over the life of the receivable 
the discount on the receivables is adjusted for prepayments at the time of prepayment 
there is no assumption for prepayment recorded at inception 
the amount of amortization has increased each year as the level of receivables generated under longer term  free interest financing promotions has increased 
we will continue to offer similar financing programs in other income expense  net other income expense  net is primarily related to gains or losses on the sales of real estate 
we have had dispositions of warehouses as we transitioned our distribution methodology to various markets 
during  we had gains from the sale of our florida regional warehouse and other properties of million 
we sold the regional warehouse which served the mid south region and other properties during generating gains of million 
during  we had gains of million from the sale of two local market warehouses and other retail properties and million from the early termination of a lease by the landlord 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for  for  and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes 
table of contents apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  opinion and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we will adopt statement r on january  as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the company began a transition in to the use of restricted stock grants in lieu of stock options in its long term incentive compensation strategy 
on august   the directors  upon the recommendation of the board s executive compensation and employee benefits committee  approved the acceleration of vesting of all out of the money  unvested stock options held by current employees  including executive officers and certain employee directors 
the decision to initiate the acceleration was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would be expected to be recorded in future periods following the company s adoption of statement r 
as a result of the acceleration  the company reduced this expected compensation expense  net of tax  by a total of approximately million approximately million in  million in  and million in 
these amounts are based on fair value calculations using the black scholes methodology 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend upon  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in   and  respectively 
earnings per share 
effective for the quarter ended june   the company began reporting its earnings per share using the two class method as required by the emerging issues task force eitf 
the eitf reached final consensus on issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share sfas  at their march  meeting 
eitf requires the income per share for each class of common stock to be calculated assuming of the company s earnings are distributed as dividends to each class of common stock based on their contractual rights 
the effective result of eitf is that the basic earnings per share for the common stock is approximately of the basic earnings per share of the class a common stock 
additionally  given the company s current capital structure  diluted earnings per share for common stock under eitf is the same as was previously reported for diluted earnings per share using the if converted method 
cash consideration received from vendor 
in november  the eitf issued eitf  accounting by a customer for cash consideration received from a vendor 
this eitf places certain restrictions on the treatment of advertising allowances and generally requires vendor consideration to be treated as a reduction of inventory costs for agreements entered into or significantly modified after november   with certain limited exceptions 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements as most contracts were in place prior to the effective date or allowances were tracked and identified with specific incremental advertising costs 
the company reclassified approximately  of allowances and rebates out of advertising 
table of contents and into cost of sales during based on the administrative costs to track and match allowances to vendor specific advertising costs  all vendor consideration received during was recorded as a reduction in inventory costs 
the adoption of this eitf  although not materially impacting our financial performance  makes the key metrics of gross profit and sg a not on a comparable basis for the periods prior to variable interest entities 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
previously  entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise that has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
during  we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie that is the lessor under an operating lease of our dallas distribution center and its attached retail space and three retail locations 
effective december   the company consolidated the vie and recorded a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million net of income tax expense of million  or per diluted common share 
consolidation of the vie increased property and equipment by million  accumulated depreciation by million  long term borrowings by million and created a minority interest of million 
liquidity and cash flow review liquidity and capital resources our sources of capital include  but are not limited to  cash flows from operations  the issuance of public or private placement debt  bank borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
we believe that available short term and long term capital resources are sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  working capital requirements  scheduled debt payments  dividends to our stockholders  and stock repurchases 
summary of cash activities our principal sources of cash consisted of those derived from operations of million  proceeds from a net increase in borrowings under revolving credit facilities of million  proceeds from the sale of auction rate securities of million and proceeds from the disposal of capital assets totaling million 
our primary uses of cash were for capital asset investments of million  debt payments of million  stock repurchases of million and dividend payments totaling million 
our principal sources of cash consisted of those derived from operations of million and proceeds from the disposal of capital assets totaling million 
our primary uses of cash were for capital asset investments of million  net investments in auction rate securities of million  debt payments of million and dividend payments totaling million 
operating activities our net cash derived from operating activities decreased million in to million 
this decrease was driven by a small increase in accounts receivable in as compared to a million decrease in and by a decrease in our net income 
for additional information about the changes in our assets and liabilities  refer to our financial position discussion below 

table of contents our net cash derived from operating activities decreased million in to million from million in this decrease was the result of a smaller decrease in accounts receivable for and lower net income 
for additional information about the changes in our assets and liabilities  refer to our financial position discussion below 
investing activities our capital asset investments decreased million in to million and represented the principal use of cash for investing activities 
our capital asset investments are discussed below in store expansion and capital expenditures 
our proceeds from the disposal of capital assets totaled million in as compared to million in our capital asset investments increased million in to million and represented the principal use of cash for investing activities 
our capital asset investments are discussed below in store expansion and capital expenditures 
our proceeds from the disposal of capital assets totaled million in as compared to million in financing activities our net cash used in financing activities increased million in to million from million in the principal use of cash for investing activities was for payments on debt which net of borrowings totaled million in compared to million in during  we purchased million of company stock under a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors 
our net cash used in financing activities decreased million in to million from million in the principal use of cash for investing activities was for payments on debt which totaled million in compared to million in the principal source of cash from investing activities were proceeds from the exercise of stock options which totaled million in compared to million in financial position assets prepaid expenses increased million  or  to million at december  this increase was primarily the result of payments to taxing authorities in excess of current liabilities 
other current assets decreased million  or  to million at december  this decrease is primarily the result of collections of receivables related to properties sold during as part of a tax deferral transaction or exchange 
trade accounts receivable decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of the reduced usage of our in house credit programs as our customers chose to use either bank cards or the longer deferred payment programs of our third party credit provider 
this was partially offset by a related decrease in the allowance of million to million at december  from million at december  
table of contents liabilities and stockholders equity accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  during  we imported more merchandise which offers less favorable payment terms versus domestic supply and we had million less in accrued group insurance related to the terminal liability of a self insured plan 
our total debt decreased million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was the result of cash repayments on debt of million offset by a net increase in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities of million 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million to million at december  from million at december  this change can be attributed to increases of million in accrued group insurance related to the terminal liability of a self insured plan  million for advertising  offset by a reduction in the reserve for cancelled sales and allowances 
our total debt decreased million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was the result of cash repayments as we had little usage of our revolving credit facilities during and all amounts borrowed were repaid 
financings we have revolving lines of credit available for general corporate purposes and as interim financing for capital expenditures 
these credit facilities are syndicated with five commercial banks and are comprised of two revolving lines totaling million that terminate in august borrowings under these facilities are unsecured and accrue interest at libor plus a spread that is based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we owed million under these facilities at december  we also had letters of credit in the amount of million outstanding at december   and these amounts are considered part of the facilities usage 
our unused capacity was million at december  we reviewed all of our fixed rate long term debt in and repaid those facilities that did not include significant prepayment penalties or other issues that would make accelerating the payments problematic 
we pursue a diversified approach to our financing requirements and generally balance our fixed rate and capped rate debt as determined by the interest rate environment 
our overall debt capital structure at december   was approximately unsecured and with fixed rates of interest 
our debt reduction has caused variable rate debt levels to move below typical levels 
the average effective interest rate on all borrowings was at december  our long term debt to total capital ratio was at december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not generally enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to this risk  we may use various derivative transactions 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in derivatives trading or other speculative activities 
moreover  we enter into financial instruments transactions with either major financial institutions or high credit rated counter parties  thereby limiting exposure to credit and performance related risks 
we have exposure to floating interest rates through certain of our borrowings 
therefore  interest expense will fluctuate with changes in libor and other benchmark rates 
we do not believe a basis point change in interest rates would have a significant adverse impact on our operating results or financial position
