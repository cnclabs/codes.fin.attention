private label sales in were million compared to million in the success of our private brands collections has created new opportunities within the private label business to add value in the development and marketing of new initiatives for sears  mothers work  avenue  chico s  and other retailers 
these initiatives were launched during  and are on track to be significant growth areas for private brands we launched our private brands initiative in  pursuant to which we acquire ownership of or license rights to a brand name and sell apparel products under this brand  generally to a single retail company within a geographic region 
private brands sales in were million compared to million in at december   we owned or licensed rights to the following private brands o american rag cie during the first quarter of  we extended our agreement with macy s merchandising group for six years  pursuant to which we exclusively distribute our american rag cie brand through macy s merchandising group s national department store organization of more than stores

net sales of alain weiz branded apparel totaled million in o souvenir by cynthia rowley we are in discussions with retailers to identify a potential distribution alliance for the fall or holiday season for souvenir by cynthia rowley 
o gear during the fourth quarter of  k mart discontinued sales of gear products  which resulted in a decline in sales for this brand in the fourth quarter of net sales of gear branded apparel totaled million in we do not anticipate sales of gear branded apparel in o jessica simpson brands the js by jessica simpson brand was originally launched as a denim line with charming shoppes 
however  charming shoppes informed us that they would not go forward with the line  resulting in reduced sales for this brand in the fourth quarter of net sales of js by jessica simpson and princy by jessica simpson  which is the department store and better specialty store brand  totaled million in in march  we became involved in a dispute with the licensor of the jessica simpson brands over our continued rights to these brands 
accordingly  we do not anticipate sales of jessica simpson branded apparel after the first quarter of unless and until we successfully resolve our dispute with the licensor 
o house of dereon by tina knowles we began shipping products for the house of dereon by tina knowles brand in the fourth quarter of  resulting in net sales of  in in march  we terminated our license agreement for this brand  and sold our remaining inventory to the licensor 
prior to december   we had written off the capitalized balance of million related to the agreement and recognized a loss accordingly in the loss was classified as royalty expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
internal revenue service audit in january  the internal revenue service completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  through the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our income tax payable for the six years under examination 
this adjustment would also result in additional state taxes and interest 
in addition  in july  the irs initiated an examination of our federal income tax return for the year ended december  in march  the irs proposed an adjustment to our taxable income of approximately million related to similar issues identified in their audit of the through federal income tax returns 
the proposed adjustments to our federal income tax return would not result in additional tax due for that year due to the tax loss reported in the federal return 
however  it could reduce the amount of net operating losses available to offset taxes due from the preceding tax years 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to and intend to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments made to our federal income tax returns for the years ended through if the proposed adjustments are upheld through the administrative and legal process  they could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flow 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters on the consolidated balance sheets included in the consolidated financial statements under the caption income taxes 
the maximum amount of loss in excess of the amount accrued in the financial statements is million 
we do not believe that the adjustments  if any  arising from the irs examination  will result in an additional income tax liability beyond what is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are required to make assumptions about matters  which are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material effect on our financial condition or result of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to returns  discounts  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged period of time 
management believes our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and chargebacks disputes from the customer based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and chargebacks based on our historical collection experience 
if collection experience deteriorates for example  due to an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts reserves was million  compared to million at december  inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
under certain market conditions  we use estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory to properly value inventory 
inventory adjustments are made for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value and charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustments become known 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following o a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner of the use of the acquired asset or the strategy for the overall business  or o a significant negative industry or economic trend 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to this statement  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization  but rather an annual assessment of impairment applied on a fair value based test 
we utilized the discounted cash flow methodology to estimate fair value 
at december   we have a goodwill balance of million  and a net property and equipment balance of million  as compared to a goodwill balance of million and a net property and equipment balance of million at december  our net property and equipment balance at december  reflects the disposal of our mexico fixed assets of million in the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   we did not recognize any impairment related to goodwill and property and equipment 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in  we evaluated the long lived assets in mexico for recoverability and concluded that the book value of the asset group was significantly higher than the expected future cash flows and that impairment had occurred 
accordingly  we recognized a non cash impairment loss of approximately million in the second quarter of the impairment charge was the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the impaired assets 
our determination of fair value was determined based on independent appraisals of the property and equipment obtained in june foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of our mexico and hong kong subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date  income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the respective periods 
the functional currency in which we transact business in hong kong is the hong kong dollar and in mexico is the peso 
foreign currency gains and losses resulting from translation of assets and liabilities are included in other comprehensive income loss 
transaction gains or losses  other than inter company debt deemed to be of a long term nature  are included in net income loss in the period in which they occur 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of shipment for all merchandise sold based on fob shipping point 
for merchandise shipped on landed duty paid ldp terms  revenue is recognized at the point of either leaving customs for direct shipments or at the point of leaving our warehouse where title is transferred  net of an estimate of returned merchandise and discounts 
customers are allowed the rights of return or non acceptance only upon receipt of damaged products or goods with quality different from shipment samples 
we do not undertake any after sale warranty or any form of price protection 
we often arrange  on behalf of manufacturers  for the purchase of fabric from a single supplier 
we have the fabric shipped directly to the cutting factory and invoice the factory for the fabric 
generally  the factories pay us for the fabric with offsets against the price of the finished goods 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding us federal tax issues that are currently unresolved  based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that amounts are properly accrued for 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we will record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in any period we determine that the original estimate of a tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current tax matters 
debt covenants our debt agreements require certain covenants including a minimum level of net worth as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if our results of operations erode and we are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders  the debt would be in default and callable by our lenders 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in our debt agreements  substantially all of our long term debt would become due in full if any of the debt is in default 
in anticipation of us not being able to meet the required covenants due to various reasons  we either negotiate for changes in the relative covenants or an advance waiver or reclassify the relevant debt as current 
we also believe that our lenders would provide waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with other debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  we would be required to reduce our expenses  including by curtailing operations  and to raise capital through the sale of assets  issuance of equity or otherwise  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

the decrease in gross profit for was primarily due to the substantial decrease in sales volume

net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss as is typical for us  quarterly net sales fluctuated significantly because our customers typically place bulk orders with us  and a change in the number of orders shipped in any one period may have a material effect on the net sales for that period 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from the funding of our working capital needs  principally inventory  finished goods shipments in transit  work in process and accounts receivable  including receivables from our contract manufacturers that relate primarily to fabric we purchase for use by those manufacturers 
our primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities  issuance of long term debt  sales of equity and debt securities  and vendor financing 
in the near term  we expect that our operations and borrowings under bank and other credit facilities will provide sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt 
in the long term  we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities 
our liquidity is dependent  in part  on customers paying on time 
any abnormal chargebacks or returns may affect our source of short term funding 
any changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on our cash flow 
suppliers credit is another major source of short term financing and any adverse changes in their terms will have negative impact on our cash flow 
other principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include o deterioration of sales due to weakness in the markets in which we sell our products  o decreases in market prices for our products  o increases in costs of raw materials  and o changes in our working capital requirements 
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include o financial covenants contained in our current or future bank and debt facilities  and o volatility in the market price of our common stock or in the stock markets in general 
the disposition of our mexico operations in enabled us to return to the business model that was profitable prior to implementation of our vertically integrated manufacturing operations that required major capital expenditures and substantial working capital 
the lease and subsequent sale of our mexican facilities significantly reduced our working capital requirements due to fewer employees and the elimination of fixed overhead 
investment in inventory also was substantially reduced as we no longer need to purchase raw materials  such as cotton  at commencement of the manufacturing process and carry the costs of such materials until finished goods are shipped to our customers 
reduced working capital and capital expenditures in mexico has resulted in a corresponding reduction of outstanding indebtedness and interest payments 
furthermore  we no longer need to accept orders with low or negative margins to fill production capacity in slow seasons  which should improve margins and allow us to source production in the best locations worldwide 
certain of our private brands product lines are generally associated with higher selling  general and administrative expenses  due to significant design  development  and marketing costs compared to our private label business 
cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows dollars in thousands cash flows net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net cash used in operating activities was million in  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities in of million and million in net cash used in operating activities in resulted primarily from a net income of million  reduced by increases of million in accounts receivable and million in inventory  partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million and an increase of million in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable in was primarily due to increase in sales volume 
during  net cash provided by investing activities was million  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in and net cash used in investing activities of million in cash provided by investing activities in included approximately million of collection of advances from our chairman and million of collection on notes receivable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of doing business in mexico as well as certain debt denominated in euro 
as a result  we bear the risk of exchange rate gains and losses that may result in the future as a result of this financing 
at times we use forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations of foreign currencies on purchases and commitments 
these short term assets and commitments are principally related to trade payables positions and fixed asset purchase obligations 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we actively evaluate the creditworthiness of the financial institutions that are counter parties to derivative financial instruments  and we do not expect any counter parties to fail to meet their obligations 
interest rate risk 
because our obligations under our various credit agreements bear interest at floating rates primarily prime rates  we are sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
any major increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would have a material impact on earning or cash flows during the next fiscal year 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect interest paid on our debt 
a majority of our credit facilities are at variable rates
