competition the banking and financial services industry is extremely competitive in our market area 
we face vigorous competition for customers  loans and deposits from many companies  including commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  credit unions  trust companies  mortgage companies  money market mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment firms 
many of these competitors are significantly larger than national penn  have greater resources  lending limits and larger branch systems  offer a wider array of banking services than national penn  and are long established in their geographic markets some of which have only been recently entered by national penn 
see general development of business below 
in addition  some of these competitors are subject to a lesser degree of regulation than that imposed on national penn 
many of these competitors have elected to become financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act of  including many of the largest ones 
this development will likely further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
see gramm leach bliley act below 
business strategy our goal is to become the most highly regarded financial institution in the markets we serve 
we intend to accomplish this goal by combining the sophisticated products and fee based services of a major regional financial services company with the personal attention  service and responsiveness of a community bank holding company 
we believe this strategy results in greater profitability than a typical community bank 
the primary components of our business strategy are commercial banking  consumer banking  niche marketing  development of fee income  and enhanced customer service 
commercial banking 
commercial banking has been our historic and ongoing business focus 
our business customers tend to be small to middle market customers with annual gross revenues generally between million and million who generally do not receive the attention of our larger  more nationally focused competitors 
many of these customers require us to have a high degree of understanding of their business in order for us to be able to customize solutions to their financial requirements 
we believe that this helps to distinguish us from our competitors 
we offer a wide range of products including short term loans for seasonal and working capital purposes  term loans secured by real estate and other assets  loans for construction and expansion needs  revolving credit plans and sophisticated cash management services 
as of december   our commercial loan portfolio was billion  which represents of our total loans outstanding 
another important component of our commercial lending practice is our emphasis on small businesses and their unique needs 
in order to serve small businesses better  national penn bank is an approved sba preferred express lender by the us small business administration 
being a preferred express lender authorizes us to underwrite and approve qualifying small business loans without the prior approval of the small business administration 
during  national penn bank originated over million of loans that qualified for us small business administration guarantees 
consumer banking 
we offer a full range of deposit accounts  which include demand  now  money market  certificates of deposit and other checking and savings accounts 
we also offer consumer loan products such as installment loans  home equity loans  residential mortgage loans  multi family loans  educational loans and credit cards 
in addition  we offer automated teller services through an inter bank automated teller system  safe deposit and night depository facilities and internet banking services  including on line bill paying 
niche marketing 
an important component of our business strategy is the development of business lines that give us higher margin opportunities 
we are continually assessing the markets within which we operate in order to identify and seize upon opportunities where we believe a market segment is being under served 
once identified  we focus on customizing solutions that are beneficial to the user and profitable to us 
an example is our manufacturing group 
the manufacturing group  organized in  is a unique lending group whose focus is on assisting manufacturing firms in solving industry specific challenges 
the manufacturing group is comprised of specialized teams of experienced bankers who have industry specific training or experience and can offer an array of resources to time challenged business owners  through the manufacturing group s solutions network tm a database of national penn professionals and other selected third party resource providers who assist with financial and non financial business challenges 
value added areas include industry specific seminars  newsletters  websites and a board of advisors that provides feedback and support to the group 
at december   the manufacturing group managed relationships with loans outstanding of approximately million 
another example is our international banking group 
the international banking group provides for customer import  export and general documentary credit  foreign exchange and international payment needs 
as of december  the unit served over customers with a letter of credit portfolio totaling million 
the international banking group has been in operation since june a third example is our government banking group  formed in  which serves the unique banking needs of local government entities such as school districts  municipalities and townships 
at december   our government banking group deposits totaled million 
development of fee income 
in addition to generation of fee income through our commercial banking operations  we have formed a number of specialized investment  insurance and lending subsidiaries to develop fee income and to serve specific markets 
we provide trust and investment management services through national penn investors trust company  our national trust company subsidiary 
we also provide investment management services through national penn capital advisors  inc and market brokerage services provided by primevest financial services  inc through national penn investment services 
in total  our wealth management group manages approximately billion for over  individual and corporate customers 
we have provided securities brokerage services through a third party vendor since december prior to december  we provided securities brokerage services through a registered broker dealer subsidiary 
we provide insurance services through national penn insurance agency  inc national penn insurance agency generated over million in revenue in  acquired three insurance agencies since june  and now serves over  customers 
we conduct mortgage banking activities through national penn mortgage company 
national penn mortgage company originated million in residential mortgages and million in mortgage banking income in for the year ended december   our efforts produced total fee income for the company of million compared to million for the year ended december  enhanced customer service 
our business strategy is supported by a strong delivery system that places greater emphasis on customer service 
we have segmented our market into divisions based primarily on geographic considerations 
each division is managed by a division president who reports to a designated executive officer 
this officer coordinates our sales and servicing efforts in order to effectively serve our current customers and gain new customers 
the purpose of this initiative is to better leverage our centralized marketing and servicing efforts  thereby increasing sales of the wide range of products and services that we offer 
we believe that this cross functional approach leads to more responsive service for our customers who  in turn  reward us with more of their total financial services needs

loan portfolio at december  and  our portfolio was composed of the following loan types dollars in thousands december percentage of portfolio december percentage of portfolio commercial real estate commercial properties residential subdivision multifamily commercial business loans commercial term loans mortgages lines of credit leases consumer loans residential mortgages home equity loans home equity lines of credit other loans total loans commercial lending general a majority of national penn bank s loan assets are loans to business owners of many types 
national penn bank makes commercial loans for real estate development  equipment financing  account receivables and inventory financing and other purposes as required by the broad spectrum of borrowers 
commercial loans by their nature carry higher risk than loans to consumers 
the changes in commercial borrowers financial condition and cash flow plus the potential volatility in the value of collateral held makes commercial lending a higher risk form of lending 
consequently  a greater percentage of national penn bank s resources and the staff s time are devoted to monitoring this area of the portfolio 
national penn bank s credit policies determine advance rates against the different forms of collateral that can be pledged against commercial loans 
typically  loans will be limited to of real estate values  of new equipment  against eligible accounts receivable and or less against finished inventory or raw material 
individual loan advance rates may be higher or lower depending upon the financial strength of the borrower and or the term of the loan

interest rates will be either floating or fixed for periods up to years 
many loans  although written with extended amortizations  will actually require balloon payments at   or years

the lines finance short term working capital needs of the borrower including funds for accounts receivable  inventory  short term equipment needs and operating expenses 
lines of credit allow the business owner to borrow  repay  and re borrow funds on an as needed basis up to a pre determined maximum level 
lines of credit are typically committed for one year but may be granted for longer terms based on the financial strength of the borrower and the collateral provided 
typical collateral for a line of credit will consist of the borrower s accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment

leases can be capital leases  operating leases  conditional sales contracts or other lease structures dependent on the financial condition and needs of the lessee as well as the type of equipment involved

consumer lending general national penn bank provides loans to consumers to finance personal residences  automobiles  college tuition  home improvements and other personal needs 
through its subsidiary  penn st financial services  inc operating under the trade name national penn mortgage company  national penn bank originates first lien residential mortgages throughout southeastern pennsylvania  new jersey  maryland  virginia  north carolina and south carolina 
in  national penn mortgage company originated million in first lien residential mortgages up from million in in  the company also originated million in second lien home equity loans 
all of these residential mortgages are sold to secondary market investors or held within national penn bank s investment or loan portfolios 
at year end  the residential mortgages held in national penn bank s loan portfolio totaled million compared to million as of december  national penn bank also provides home equity loans  home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans through its network of community offices and private banking division 
the majority of national penn bank s consumer loans are secured by the borrower s residential real estate in either a first or second lien position 
national penn bank requires a loan to value ratio of not greater than on this portfolio with some exceptions based on the borrower s financial strength 
national penn bank originates all of its home equity loans and home equity lines of credit directly with its customers 
national penn bank has a small indirect loan portfolio in which the transactions are initiated through a third party  generally an auto dealer or equipment vendor  and subsequently funded by national penn bank 
this indirect loan portfolio had total loans outstanding at december   of million 
investment policies and strategies the investment portfolio includes the national penn bank portfolio and the national penn investment company portfolio 
the national penn bank portfolio totaled billion at december  and billion at december  the investment company portfolio was million at december  and million at december  at december   national penn investors trust company had a small investment portfolio of million as a vehicle to invest its capital 
the decrease in the bank s investment portfolio from to was the result of using some of the cash flow from the portfolio to help fund our liquidity needs during the year 
national penn bank s investment portfolio consists primarily of agency and municipal bonds 
the agency bonds include debentures as well as mortgage backed securities issued by gnma  fnma and fhlmc 
agency and municipal bonds carry low risk based capital requirements 
the primary purpose of the bank investment portfolio is to provide a secondary source of liquidity  and the secondary purpose is to provide a source of income 
with liquidity as the primary focus  we concentrate on buying high quality  highly marketable securities 
we also construct the portfolio to provide a steady cash flow stream 
virtually all of the national penn bank investment portfolio supports our funding pledging needs that is  we must pledge qualifying assets to secure deposits of municipalities and other governmental entities 
in addition to the factors discussed  we follow a strategy of shortening the duration of the bank portfolio when rates are low and lengthening the duration of the investment portfolio when rates are high 
interest rates increased steadily during  so we became more comfortable purchasing longer term investments later in the year 
whether we are buying shorter term securities during low rate cycles  or longer term securities during times of higher rates  we consider the impact of the investment portfolio in the company s overall interest rate risk position 
we therefore might adjust this strategy  due to our need to remain consistent with our interest rate risk corporate guidelines 
in and  we pooled our own production of ten and fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans and converted the loans to fhlmc securities in order to transfer assets to the investment portfolio 
this is a more price efficient way to add mortgage backed securities to our portfolio as compared to purchasing mortgage backed securities in the secondary market 
these loans  when securitized  are more liquid and also support our deposit pledging needs 
there were no securitizations in national penn investment company s portfolio consists primarily of investments in regional or community banking organizations 
these investments are in the form of common stock or trust preferred securities 
the primary purpose of this portfolio is to generate income  including both current income in the form of interest and dividends  as well as long term capital gains 
the common stock is readily marketable  but there is not an active secondary market in the trust preferred securities 
our strategy in the trust preferred portfolio is to invest in other banks where we can understand the financial performance and risks involved  while enjoying a higher return 
these investments require the same risk based capital as commercial loans  but the overall dollar amount of this portfolio  at million  is relatively small so the impact on capital is not material 
operating segments national penn has one reportable segment  community banking  and certain other non reportable segments  as described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
footnote includes segment information on revenue  assets and income  and is incorporated by reference in this item products and services with reputation risk national penn and its subsidiaries offer a diverse range of financial and banking products and services 
in the event one or more customers and or governmental agencies becomes dissatisfied or objects to any product or service offered by national penn or any of its subsidiaries  negative publicity with respect to any such product or service  whether legally justified or not  could have a negative impact on national penn s reputation 
the discontinuance of any product or service  whether or not any customer or governmental agency has challenged any such product or service  could have a negative impact on national penn s reputation 
future acquisitions our acquisition strategy consists of identifying financial service companies  including banks  insurance agencies and investment advisers  with business philosophies that are similar to ours  which operate in strong markets  and which can be acquired at an acceptable cost 
in evaluating acquisition opportunities  we generally consider potential revenue enhancements and operating efficiencies  asset quality  interest rate risk  and management capabilities 
we currently have no formal commitments with respect to future acquisitions  although discussions with acquisition candidates take place frequently 
concentrations  seasonality we do not have any portion of our businesses dependent on a single or limited number of customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
no substantial portion of investments are concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries 
the company s commercial loan portfolio has a concentration in loans to commercial real estate investors and developers and a significant amount of loans are secured by real estate located in southeastern pennsylvania 
see also significant concentrations of credit risk in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
while our businesses are not seasonal in nature  we experience some fluctuation in our deposits due to the seasonality of government and school district deposits

capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
capital adequacy guidelines are intended to ensure that bank holding companies have adequate capital given the risk levels of its assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the guidelines require that bank holding companies maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  a bank holding company s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories and its capital is classified in one of three tiers 
the required minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital must be tier capital 
tier capital consists principally of common shareholders equity  retained earnings  a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the remainder of total capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt  qualifying preferred stock and loan loss allowance tier capital 
at december   national penn s tier capital and total tier and tier combined capital ratios were and  respectively 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve requires a bank holding company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio 
this requires a minimum level of tier capital as determined under the risk based capital rules to average total consolidated assets of for those bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion 
the federal reserve expects all other bank holding companies to maintain a ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
at december  national penn s leverage ratio was 
the federal reserve has also indicated that it will consider a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the federal reserve has not advised national penn of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to national penn 
the fdia requires an insured institution to take prompt corrective action in the event minimum capital requirements are not met 
pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia  the federal banking agencies have specified  by regulation  the levels at which an insured institution is considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized 
under these regulations  an institution is considered well capitalized if it satisfies each of the following requirements it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more it has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more it has a leverage ratio of or more 
it is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
at december   national penn bank qualified as well capitalized under these regulatory standards

gramm leach bliley act the gramm leach bliley act of glba repealed various provisions of the glass steagall act to permit commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks securities firms 
amended the bhca to permit qualifying bank holding companies to engage in any type of financial activity 
permits subsidiaries of national banks now to engage in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for national banks themselves 
the result is that banking companies are generally able to offer a wider range of financial products and services and are more readily able to combine with other types of financial companies  such as securities and insurance companies 
glba created a new kind of bank holding company called a financial holding company an fhc that is authorized to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to financial activities and any activity that the federal reserve determines is complementary to financial activities and does not pose undue risks to the financial system 
a bank holding company qualifies to become an fhc if it files an election with the federal reserve and if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized  well managed  and cra rated satisfactory or better 
although national penn believes that it is eligible to do so  national penn has not elected to become a financial holding company 
national penn has  instead  continued to utilize the continuing authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries to expand its business products and services 
glba also authorizes national banks to create financial subsidiaries 
this is in addition to the present authority of national banks to create operating subsidiaries 
a financial subsidiary is a direct subsidiary of a national bank that satisfies the same conditions as an fhc  plus certain other conditions  and is approved in advance by the occ 
a financial subsidiary can engage in most  but not all  of the newly authorized activities 
national penn bank has not created any financial subsidiaries 
in addition  glba includes significant provisions relating to the privacy of consumer and customer information 
these provisions apply to any company the business of which is engaging in activities permitted for an fhc  even if it is not itself an fhc 
thus  they apply to national penn 
glba requires a financial institution to adopt and disclose its privacy policy  give consumers and customers the right to opt out of disclosures to non affiliated third parties  not disclose any account information to non affiliated third party marketers and follow regulatory standards to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer and customer information 
although the long range effects of glba cannot be predicted  national penn believes glba will further narrow the differences and intensify competition among commercial banks  investment banks  insurance firms and other financial services companies 
usa patriot act in recent years  a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act gave the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers and increased information sharing 
it also substantially broadened the scope of federal anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence policies  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the united states treasury department has issued a number of regulations to implement various provisions of the patriot act 
these regulations impose obligations on national penn to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of its customers 
failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on national penn s business 
interest rate swaps national penn has used interest rate swap agreements for interest rate risk management 
no derivative financial instruments are held for trading purposes 
the contract or notional amounts of the swap agreements do not represent exposure to credit loss 
potential credit risk on these contracts arises from the counterparty s inability to meet the terms of the agreement 
management considers the credit risk of these agreements to be minimal and manages this risk through routine review of the counterparty s financial ratings 
information about the amounts of interest rate swaps is set forth in footnotes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included at item of this report 
the company had no interest rate swap agreements in critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of national penn conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the financial services industry

risk factors 
national penn s business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance 
changes in the interest rate environment may reduce profits 
the primary source of income for national penn is the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
as prevailing interest rates change  net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
an increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect national penn s net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume and overall profitability 
future governmental regulation and legislation could limit national penn s future growth 
national penn and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of the operations of national penn and its subsidiaries 
these laws may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers  depositors and the governments deposit insurance funds 
any changes to these laws may negatively affect national penn s ability to expand its services and to increase the value of its business 
while we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on national penn  these changes could be materially adverse to national penn s shareholders 
national penn s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from its national bank subsidiary  which are subject to regulatory limits 
national penn is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted by direct and indirect subsidiaries  each of which is a separate and distinct legal entity 
substantially all of national penn s assets are held by its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
national penn s ability to pay dividends depends on its receipt of dividends from its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
its national bank subsidiary  national penn bank  including national penn bank s divisions  the firstservice bank  hometowne heritage bank and the peoples bank of oxford divisions  is national penn s primary source of dividends 
dividend payments from national penn bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations  generally based on net profits and retained earnings  imposed by bank regulatory agencies 
the ability of national penn bank to pay dividends is also subject to its profitability  financial condition  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements 
at december   approximately  was available without the need for regulatory approval for the payment of dividends to national penn from national penn bank 
there is no assurance that national penn bank and or national penn s other subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that national penn will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future 
national penn s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock 
national penn s future acquisitions could dilute ownership of national penn and may cause national penn to become more susceptible to adverse economic events 
national penn has used its common stock to acquire other companies in the past and intends to acquire or make investments in banks and other complementary businesses with its common stock in the future 
national penn may issue additional shares of common stock to pay for those acquisitions  which would dilute the ownership interest of present shareholders in national penn 
future business acquisitions could be material to national penn  and any failure to integrate these businesses into national penn could have a material adverse effect on the value of national penn common stock 
in addition  any such acquisition could require national penn to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt 
in those events  national penn could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect national penn s profitability 
national penn s subsidiaries face substantial competition in originating loans  both commercial and consumer 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce national penn s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that national penn s subsidiaries originate and the interest rates they may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  national penn s subsidiaries face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of national penn s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns and better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than national penn  which could decrease the deposits that national penn attracts or require national penn to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect national penn s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  national penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase national penn s cost of funds 
national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of national penn s non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern its banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over national penn s banking and non banking subsidiaries in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit national penn s margins on banking and non banking services  reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition

expected synergies and cost savings from mergers and acquisitions  including the nittany acquisition  may not be fully realized or realized as quickly as expected 
revenues and loan growth following mergers and acquisitions  including the nittany acquisition  may be lower than expected 
loan losses  deposit attrition  operating costs  customer and key employee losses  and business disruption following mergers and acquisitions  including the nittany acquisition  may be greater than expected 
business opportunities and strategies potentially available to national penn after mergers and acquisitions  including the nittany acquisition  may not be successfully or fully acted upon 
costs  difficulties or delays related to the integration of businesses or systems of acquired companies  including nittany and its subsidiaries  with national penn s business or systems may be greater or take longer than expected 
technological changes may be harder to make or more expensive than expected or present unanticipated operational issues 
legislation or regulatory changes  including without limitation  changes in laws or regulations on competition  industry consolidation  development of competing financial products and services  changes in accounting rules and practices  changes in or additional customer privacy and data protection requirements  and intensified regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry in general  may adversely affect national penn s costs and business

the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the earnings performance and financial condition of the company with a primary focus on an analysis of operating results 
current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s strategic plan provides for a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increased market penetration in selected geographic areas  and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business 
the acquisition of peoples first  inc and its subsidiary  the peoples bank of oxford  in second quarter is a strategic initiative by the company in furtherance of its focused goals 
the acquisitions of firstservice bank and hometowne heritage bank in were similar strategic initiatives 
the acquisition of nittany financial corp 
and its subsidiary  nittany bank  in first quarter is also a similar strategic initiative 
the current economic climate and interest rate environment present challenges for all financial institutions in achieving their business goals 
continued interest margin compression makes asset growth a priority  as well as the development of fee income 
the company s goal is for asset growth each year to be generated through a combination of internal growth and growth by mergers and acquisitions 
in  substantially all asset growth was internally generated 
in  approximately one half of the company s asset growth was internally generated  and the other half was attributable to the peoples first  inc acquisition 
in the fee income area  the company s goal is to develop its wealth management and insurance businesses more fully throughout the company s entire geographic footprint 
in addition to historical information  this form k contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this document are subject to risks and uncertainty

additional information concerning forward looking statements is contained in this report at item a 
risk factors  which information is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis 
in september  the company completed the cash sale of its subsidiary  panasia bank  na panasia 
all financial information in this management s discussion and analysis for   and is restated to exclude panasia 
the sale of panasia is presented as discontinued operations under sfas no 
this presentation is intended to aid comparison of current and prior year results with future results 
all actual share and per share information is restated to reflect a five for four stock split of the company s common stock effective september   a five for four stock split of the company s common stock effective september   and a stock dividend paid on the company s common stock on september  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practice within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and the assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows or collateral liquidation values on impaired loans  mortgages  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
in this testing  the company employs general industry practices in accordance with gaap 
a fair value is determined for each reporting unit using various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill as of june each year  and again at any quarter end if any material events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
through its annual analysis as of june   the company has not identified any impairment of its goodwill 
no events occurred during third or fourth quarter necessitating a re test of goodwill impairment 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable amount 
the company has not substantially changed any aspect of its overall approach in the application of the foregoing policies 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques utilized as compared to previous years 
financial condition at december   total assets were billion  an increase of million or from the billion at december  the increase in assets in is reflected primarily in the loan and lease category  the cash and due from banks category and the other assets category  which increased million  million and million  respectively 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in investments over the prior year

in situations where a renewal is appropriate  the company s policy in this regard is to evaluate the credit for collectibility consistent with the normal loan evaluation process

risk elements loans a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection

additional discussion regarding this issue is set forth in the paragraph of this item titled allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company had no assets classified as other real estate owned at december  and december  the company had no restructured loans at december  or december  the allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming assets was and at december  and december   respectively  with the decrease in due to the decreased level of total allowance for loan and lease losses

investment portfolio the investment portfolio is primarily a secondary source of liquidity  but it also serves as a source of income 
as such  the investment portfolio consists of shorter term investments that provide current liquidity and longer term investments that provide higher income 
over the past three years  the company has worked to shorten the duration of the investment portfolio in response to lower interest rates and to help improve liquidity 
regardless of classification as to shorter term or longer term  the majority of the company s investments are readily marketable securities held as available for sale  and the majority of the company s investments qualify as collateral for deposit pledging needs 
certain investment securities purchased during the second half of were classified as held to maturity 
due to our pledging requirements  these securities would most likely be held to maturity regardless of classification 
investments of both held to maturity and available for sale securities decreased million or to billion at december  compared to december  investment purchases during were million  primarily us government agency and municipal securities 
this increase was partially offset by investment calls and maturities and the amortization of mortgage backed securities totaling million

national penn s management uses these non gaap measures in its analysis of the company s performance 
non gaap net income and earnings per share exclude other significant gains  losses or expenses that are unusual in nature and not expected to recur 
because these items are not necessarily representative of underlying trends in the company s performance  management believes that presentation of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the company s core businesses 
this also facilitates comparisons with prior or subsequent comparable periods 
another non gaap financial measure  annualized net income return on average tangible equity  excludes the average balance of acquisition related goodwill and intangibles in determining average tangible shareholders equity 
banking and financial institution regulators also exclude goodwill and intangibles from shareholders equity when assessing the capital adequacy of a financial institution 
management believes the presentation of this financial measure excluding the impact of these items provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of national penn  as it provides a method to assess management s success in utilizing the company s tangible capital 
these disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined in accordance with gaap  nor are they necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies

net interest income increased million or to million in from the amount of million 
interest income increased million or to million in  as compared to million in  as a result of an increase in loan interest income of million and an increase in investment securities interest income of million 
interest expense in increased million or to million from the amount of million due to an increase in interest on deposits of million  an increase in interest on long term borrowings of million  and an increase in expense for securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds sold of million 
the increase in interest expense on deposits is due primarily to an increase in interest bearing deposits and the average rate paid on these deposits in the increase in interest expense on borrowings is a result of an increase in the average balance of borrowings outstanding during and an increase in the average rate on borrowings in the repurchase agreement and federal funds sold category 
the cost of attracting and holding deposited funds is an ever increasing expense in the banking industry 
these increases are the real costs of deposit accumulation and retention  including fdic insurance costs  marketing and community office overhead expenses 
such costs are necessary for continued growth and to maintain and increase market share of available deposits 
the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increase related to higher outstanding balances and that due to the levels and volatility of interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate  and changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume 
for purposes of the following table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

net interest margin is net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
during  net interest margin was  compared to during and during the decline in the net interest margin from the margin is attributable to continued competitive pressures and general overall margin compression 
allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is determined by periodic reviews of loan quality  current economic conditions  loss experience and loan growth 
based on these factors  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december  and million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and lease losses of million at year end and million at year end as a percentage of total loans was at year end and at year end net loan chargeoffs were million in net loan chargeoffs of million in were unusually low compared to historical company results 
net loan chargeoffs of million in were typical compared to historical company results 
management continues to believe its loan loss allowance is adequate to cover losses inherent in the current portfolio 
a detailed analysis of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses for the five years ended december   is shown below dollars in thousands december  balance at beginning of year charge offs commercial and industrial loans and leases real estate loans construction and land development residential other loans to individuals total charge offs recoveries commercial and industrial real estate loans construction and land development residential other loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs provision charged to expense adjustments changes incident to mergers  net balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period commercial and industrial loans  real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all or part of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
loans to individuals are charged off any time repayment is deemed highly unlikely or as soon as the loan becomes days delinquent 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses  which are inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve based on historical trends  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial and industrial loans  real estate development loans  and construction loans which have been identified by bank management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole or part is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial loans  real estate development and construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes or any other factor  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
before applying the historical loss experience percentages  loan balances are reduced by the portion of the loan balances  if any  which are subject to a guarantee by a government agency 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information  which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believes that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
the level of non performing assets  including loans over days delinquent 
levels of allowance for specific classified assets 
a review of portfolio concentration of any type  either customer  industry loan type  collateral or risk grade 
the following table shows how the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated among the various types of loans and leases that the company has outstanding

liquidity and interest rate sensitivity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
during  the company s liquidity position was strong as people removed money from the declining equity market 
at that time  many customers preferred the safety of fdic insured deposits compared to the uncertain equity market  despite historically low interest rates 
this allowed the company to grow its core deposit base and significantly reduce reliance on non core sources of funds during in  as the economy started to improve  the company s liquidity was not as strong as in  but liquidity was clearly adequate to meet the needs of the company s customers 
as the economy and equity markets continued to improve during  liquidity became more challenging 
more customers were willing to move their money back into the equity market  businesses were investing their cash balances into their business  thereby reducing their deposits in the bank  and loan demand improved 
as the liquidity needs of banking customers increased  the competition in the banking industry increased 
this competition for deposits was especially heightened in our marketplace by the formation of a number of new banks 
in addition to this general challenging environment  liquidity was further affected during the first seven months of as deposits from government entities  especially school districts  experienced their seasonal decline 
school district deposits typically materialize in august and september as school districts receive their tax funding 
the funds then typically reduce during the next twelve months as the school districts use the money to pay expenses  reaching a low point by the end of july or early august 
then in mid to late august  the cycle begins again 
we also experience this phenomenon with local government entities from march through february  but the amount of local government entity deposits is smaller so the affect is lessened 
the company successfully met this liquidity challenge in through a variety of tactics  including proactively marketing deposits to commercial customers with larger deposits  using the company s marketing software to identify retail customers with a high propensity to move additional deposits to the company  and then marketing directly to those customers 
developing new deposit products such as the prime rate certificate of deposit  offering a certificate of deposit promotion in august which netted over million in new deposits  using brokered deposits  selling all fixed rate mortgage production we had typically held year and year mortgage production  using our ample availability of borrowed funds from correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank  and using the cash flow from the investment portfolio 
through it all  deposits increased from to while borrowed funds were used to help offset the seasonal outflow of the school district deposits during the year  by the end of  borrowed funds were lower than the end of we expect that the challenging liquidity environment will continue into and that the competition for deposits will become even more intense 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position closely and we will use much the same tactics in as we used to successfully meet the challenge in the following table shows separately the interest rate sensitivity of each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  in thousands repricing periods within three months three months through one year one year through five years over five years assets interest bearing deposits at banks federal funds sold investment securities loans and leases other assets liabilities and equity non interest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowed funds subordinated debt other liabilities shareholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid and are adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based upon assumptions estimating the expected prepayments in the interest rate environment prevailing during the fourth calendar quarter of the table assumes prepayments and scheduled principal amortization of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities  and assumes that adjustable rate mortgages will reprice at contractual repricing intervals 
there has been no adjustment for the impact of future commitments and loans in process 
savings and now deposits are scheduled for repricing based on historical deposit decay rate analyses  as well as historical moving averages of run off for the company s deposits in these categories 
while generally subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a portion of these accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities based upon the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
specifically  of these deposits are considered repriceable within three months and are considered repriceable in the over five year category 
includes federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and short and long term borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
these characteristics include the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of the repricing  and the relative levels of repricing 
attempting to minimize the interest rate sensitivity gaps is a continual challenge in a changing rate environment 
based on the company s gap position as reflected in the above table  current accepted theory would indicate that net interest income would increase in a falling interest rate environment and would decrease in a rising interest rate environment 
an interest rate gap table does not  however  present a complete picture of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
first  changes in the general level of interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
second  assets and liabilities which can contractually reprice within the same period may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or to the same extent 
third  the table represents a one day position  variations occur daily as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity throughout the year 
fourth  assumptions must be made to construct such a table 
for example  non interest bearing deposits are assigned a repricing interval of within three months  although history indicates a significant amount of these deposits will not move into interest bearing categories regardless of the general level of interest rates 
finally  the repricing distribution of interest sensitive assets may not be indicative of the liquidity of those assets 
gap analysis is a useful measurement of asset and liability management  however  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on this measure 
therefore  the company supplements gap analysis with the calculation of the economic value of equity 
this report forecasts changes in the company s market value of portfolio equity mvpe under alternative interest rate environments 
the mvpe is defined as the net present value of the company s existing assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
the calculated estimates of change in mvpe at december  are as follows dollars in thousands mvpe change in interest rate amount change basis points basis points basis points flat rate basis points basis points basis points management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the vulnerability of the company s earnings and capital to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on mvpe could vary substantially if different assumptions are used  such as or basis point changes in interest rates  or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
if the company should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its mvpe subsequent to an immediate and sustained change in interest rate  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such mismatch 
the company could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or it could emphasize deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
the company anticipates a continuing inverted yield curve during this is a particularly challenging environment that has the effect of squeezing the company s net interest margins 
given this assumption  the company s asset liability strategy for is to maintain a fairly balanced interest rate risk position 
this is intended to position the company to react appropriately whenever the inverted yield curve normalizes  and to lessen the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
effective monitoring of interest rate risk is the priority of the company s asset liability management committee

in order for the company to be considered well capitalized  as defined by banking regulators  the company must have tier and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
at december   national penn bank met the criteria for a well capitalized institution  and management believes that  under current regulations  the company will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
the company does not presently have any commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company is experiencing a space shortage and is planning construction of an operations facility

the land use township approval process for an operations center of up to  square feet is currently pending 
the company is not under any agreement with regulatory authorities nor is it aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources  or operations of the company 
on december   the company s board or directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock to be used to fund the company s dividend reinvestment plan  stock compensation plans  stock based benefit plans  and employee stock purchase plan 
no timetable was set for these repurchases  but none will be made until completion of the repurchase program approved in september on september   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock adjusted for the five for four stock split effective september  to be used to fund the company s dividend reinvestment plan  stock option plans  stock based benefit plans and employee stock purchase plan

future outlook the company s market area  while diverse  is subject to many of the same economic forces being experienced regionally and nationally the general economy will likely generate loan growth in in the high single digit percentages 
the principal challenge faced by the company today is to grow our earnings in light of the compression of our net interest margin due to current and anticipated interest rate levels 
in this environment  we seek to increase our net interest income principally through increased volume  including volume from mergers and acquisitions  and to increase our non interest income  especially revenues from insurance and wealth management activities 
we anticipate continued pressure on net interest margin through the company  like many of its peers  continues to be concerned about current and near term uncertain economic conditions and their effect on its loan volume as well as its overall credit quality
