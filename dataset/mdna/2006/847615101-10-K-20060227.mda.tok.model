accordingly  jdk and amplifonix net sales of  and million  respectively  have been included in our consolidated net sales for the year ended november  cbu net sales included in our consolidated financial statements amounted to million for the year ended november  and million for the year ended november  sei net sales were million and million  respectively  for the years ended november  and amplifonix  cbu  and sei are all reported within our rf and microwave components and systems business for operating segment purposes 
jdk is reported within our newly created sensors and controls business segment 
asset impairment loss during the year ended november   our  square foot ceramic manufacturing facility in new orleans  louisiana  was severely damaged by hurricane katrina and related flooding the hurricane 
as a result of the hurricane  we realized asset impairment losses of million for inventories and million for building and equipment  before expected insurance proceeds 
in addition  we incurred direct clean up  asset assessment  and repair costs of million 
as of november   we had received million of insurance proceeds and we believe it is probable that we will receive another million in fiscal upon final settlement of all related claims 
accordingly  in connection with the hurricane and after expected insurance recoveries  we recorded net asset impairment losses and related expenses of  this amount has been included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of income for the year ended november  forward looking information the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including statements regarding our belief as to future market conditions and our ability to resume manufacturing of ceramic capacitors  our projected capital expenditures  our anticipated research and development expenses  and our expected future operating requirements and financing needs

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued executive summary during  our net sales increased by million or from in addition to the positive impact of our recent business acquisitions  shipments of our microwave products and power management systems grew significantly during the current year 
increased shipments for our microwave products principally reflect strong demand in the military aerospace sector  while our power management systems continue to gain customer recognition and market share 
shipments of our signal and power integrity components decreased by million in  primarily reflecting poor market conditions throughout the passive electronic components industry 
late in  this business segment was also negatively impacted by hurricane katrina and its disruption to our internally manufactured ceramic capacitors 
our gross margin grew to million in  up million from a year ago 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin was in compared to in this decline in gross margin percentage principally reflects additional manufacturing overhead costs from ongoing integration and consolidation expenses associated with our recent acquisitions of amplifonix and cbu  poor absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead resulting from the decline in revenue of our signal and power integrity components business  and additional manufacturing overhead required to support the current and expected future growth of our rf and microwave components and systems business 
our selling expenses increased by million in  primarily driven by additional sales volume and related selling activities 
in  general and administrative expenses grew by million 
this increase includes  of net asset impairment losses and expenses related to hurricane katrina  as well as additional computer software licensing fees  amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets  and professional fees related to our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of our overall profitability improved  with net income and earnings per share of million or cents per share in fiscal compared to million or cents per share in fiscal despite increases in certain working capital requirements  our operating cash flow remains strong 
net cash generated by operating activities was million in fiscal this positive cash flow  which reflects our profitable operating performance and improved accounts receivable turnover rates  helped enable us to expend net cash of million for acquired businesses in fiscal at november   our cash and cash equivalents were million  our current ratio was to  and our total debt to equity was to

sales for this business segment were million in  up million from a year ago 
of this million increase  million reflects amplifonix product sales and another million was generated by our operations in palm bay  florida  which we acquired in october as part of our acquisition of cbu 
although our rf and microwave components and systems are used in numerous industries and applications  sales in the military aerospace sector were particularly strong in the current year 
sales of our power management systems grew by million in these advanced systems are used in various infrastructure equipment including wireless base stations  optical networks  it hubs  data centers  and certain military applications 
since our introduction of these products a few years ago  we continue to gain customer recognition and market share 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued shipments of our signal and power integrity components were down million in  principally reflecting poor market conditions throughout the passive electronic components industry 
although these market conditions have recently demonstrated some signs of improvement  the overall business environment throughout the passive components industry remains unpredictable 
accordingly  soft market demand for our signal and power integrity components may continue into fiscal in addition  as a result of hurricane katrina and its related disruption of our internally manufactured ceramic capacitors  approximately million of signal product shipments were delayed as of the end of fiscal in december  we acquired certain ceramic manufacturing facilities in state college  pennsylvania 
the acquired facilities will become the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic operations  replacing the operations previously conducted in new orleans  louisiana 
our current plan is to begin pre production volumes at the state college facilities as early as march pending receipt of applicable governmental permits  with full production during the third quarter of fiscal until full production is achieved  we will purchase certain ceramic capacitors from third party suppliers 
delivery delays or price increases by these outside suppliers would have a negative impact on our signal integrity components business 
total customer orders received in fiscal amounted to million  up million or from at november   our sales order backlog was million  compared to million at november  overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable in throughout all of our product lines 
gross margin gross margin in fiscal was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal as a percentage of sales  material and labor costs declined during the current year with aggregate material and labor costs amounting to of sales in and of sales in this decrease primarily reflects reduced material costs from numerous cost reduction programs  including the expanded worldwide sourcing of our material and component requirements 
total manufacturing overhead costs were million or of sales in  versus million or of sales in the increase in manufacturing costs was principally driven by the following factors  all of relatively equal significance ongoing integration and consolidation costs associated with our recent acquisitions of amplifonix and cbu  poor absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead resulting from the decline in revenue of our signal and power integrity components business  and additional manufacturing overhead required to support the current and expected future growth of our rf and microwave components and systems business 
at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  compared to  employees at november  we expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to improve operating efficiencies  while maintaining flexibility for future capacity expansion 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  principally reflects the impact of higher sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
general and administrative expense was million in  versus million in the increase in general and administrative expense includes  of net asset impairment losses and expenses related to hurricane katrina   of computer software licensing fees for additional employees and system users  and  of added amortization expense primarily from acquisition related intangible assets 
the balance of the increase in general and administrative expense reflects additional expenditures for legal and professional services associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and other operating expenses related to our increased business levels 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income and expense interest expense remained relatively constant at  in fiscal and  in fiscal current year reductions in bank indebtedness were substantially offset by higher average interest rates 
we hold numerous united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology 
we realized license fee income of  in and  in upon the granting of pml technology licenses 
although these licenses  as well as other pml licenses that we have previously granted  require certain royalties to be paid to us upon the sale of products utilizing pml technology  it is not known what future commercial value  if any  these patents and related licenses may have 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
net losses from foreign currency transactions of  in and  in were incurred and charged against operations 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets  including aggregate state net operating loss carryforwards of  expiring at varying amounts through in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to net sales consolidated net sales increased by million or from this increase  which was reflected throughout all of our major product lines  was primarily driven by improved market conditions throughout the telecommunications equipment industry and increased demand for our military related products 
in addition  our net sales include million of product sales for our acquired businesses of cbu and sei 
sales of signal integrity components amounted to million in  up million from the prior year 
these products are used in a wide variety of applications and industries including telecommunications  military  aerospace  medical and automotive 
power integrity component sales increased by million in  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal among other applications  these power products are incorporated into various telecom equipment including wireless base stations and telephone switching gear 
sales of power management systems were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal these advanced systems include power distribution units  fuse and breaker interface panels  and remote monitoring systems used in wireless base stations and other telecommunication infrastructure equipment 
in addition to cbu and sei aggregate product sales of million  rf and microwave components and systems sales grew by million in fiscal overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable throughout all of our product lines 
total customer orders received in amounted to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
gross margin gross margin in fiscal was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the improvement in gross margin percentage principally reflects decreases in manufacturing overhead costs  from consolidation and cost reduction programs  and economies of scale realized with additional production and shipment volumes 
total manufacturing overhead costs were million or of sales in fiscal  versus million or of sales in the preceding year 
as a percentage of sales  material and labor costs remained reasonably stable throughout the period with aggregate material and labor costs amounting to million or of sales in and million or of sales in at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  including cbu personnel of and sei personnel of at november   we had employees 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  primarily reflects the impact of higher sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
in addition  effective sales commission rates decreased slightly in general and administrative expense was million in and million in the million increase in general and administrative expense principally reflects higher personnel costs  additional expenditures for legal and professional services  and other operating expenses related to increased business levels 
other income and expense interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal  reflecting reductions in bank indebtedness throughout in  other income and expense consists of interest income from short term investments of  pml license fee income of  and net losses on foreign currency transactions of  in  other income reflects  of interest income   of pml license fee income  and  of net gains on foreign currency transactions 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
risk factors that may affect future results in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were to customers in the telecommunications industry 
our three largest telecom customers  original equipment manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  represented of our total consolidated net sales in several years ago  the telecommunications equipment industry experienced a severe slowdown 
recently  market conditions in the industry have demonstrated improvement  but overall market trends and forecasts remain unpredictable 
if the current market conditions deteriorate  it will have a material negative impact on our future operating performance 
military aircraft and naval vessels generally contain extensive communication equipment  electronic countermeasure equipment for defense against enemy weapons  smart weapons and munitions  and radar systems 
we provide low pass filters  multisection assemblies  and various microwave components and integrated assemblies to major equipment manufacturers for installation into these systems 
we also provide various emi filtered arrays and filtered connectors to aerospace manufacturers for use in commercial applications such as point to point telemetry and avionic upgrades 
in fiscal  military aerospace sales were approximately of our consolidated sales 
demand for military aerospace products may be impacted by numerous economic  technological and political factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that sales to such customers will not decrease in the future 
in addition  our results of operations may be negatively affected in the future by a variety of other factors including time delays and cost overages in commencing ceramic capacitor manufacturing at our new state college facilities  cost increases and delivery delays for ceramic capacitors purchased from third party suppliers  changes in the availability of other raw materials  competitive pricing pressures  new technologies which decrease the demand for our products  new product offerings by our competitors  product cost changes  changes in the overall economic climate  cancellation of existing customer order backlog  unanticipated impairment of assets  difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and product lines  and changes in product mix 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition during the years ended november  and  we maintained a domestic line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie  pennsylvania the bank 
throughout and  no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit arrangement 
on december   we entered into a new five year revolving credit facility with the bank 
this new million credit facility  with an additional million expansion feature  replaces the prior line of credit 
borrowings under the new agreement will be secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property  and bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate 
the new line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability  and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
these covenants are similar to those included in the prior line of credit arrangement 
our ability to borrow in the future under this new credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants 
whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future  for which there can be no assurance 
our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating approximately million euro million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at november   we had net working capital of million  compared to million at november  and million at november  our current ratio remains strong with current assets times current liabilities at november   compared to at november  and at november  the reductions in our working capital and current ratio primarily reflect the impact of acquiring businesses and their related long lived assets by utilizing some of our existing cash reserves 
excluding the assets of our acquired businesses  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in and million in capital expenditures in were primarily for building improvements and manufacturing equipment for our china manufacturing operations  as well as expanding capacity and efficiencies in our rf and microwave components and systems business 
in  our capital expenditures principally related to routine replacement of fixed assets  and tooling for our china production requirements 
in response to uncertain overall market conditions  and as part of our related cost containment programs  we controlled our capital expenditures in to minimum required amounts 
total capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were  in these capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing equipment and tooling to enhance efficiencies  particularly in our ceramic capacitor operations 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of jdk in october in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of amplifonix 
the total net cash purchase price for these acquired businesses was million  which was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of cbu 
the aggregate cash purchase price paid for cbu was million  excluding contingent payments 
under the terms of the applicable asset purchase agreement  contingent payments were to be determined based upon the total customer orders received for cbu products during the fourth calendar quarter of and the first calendar quarter of if the aggregate customer orders received in either quarter exceeded million the target  a contingent payment would be earned equal to of the amount by which the actual customer orders received in the quarter exceeded the target 
contingent payments of  and  were computed and earned for the fourth calendar quarter of and first calendar quarter of  respectively 
in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the contingent payments were paid in cash within days following the close of the applicable calendar quarter 
these contingent payments in fiscal year were added to the goodwill previously recognized in the acquisition of cbu 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of sei 
the aggregate cash purchase price paid for sei was million  excluding any acquisition related taxes imposed on sei attributable to making a section election for federal income tax purposes 
during the year ended november   we computed and paid a tax liability of  related to the section election 
as a result of this final tax payment  additional goodwill of  was recognized in fiscal year for the acquisition of sei 
we have adopted a stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices 
funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the company s capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of the company s common stock 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
during fiscal and  no shares were repurchased 
we repurchased  shares in fiscal at an aggregate cost of  since the inception of the stock repurchase program   shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue our investment in research and development in  as we continuously enhance existing product lines  design new signal and power integrity components  further develop our microwave products and power managements systems  and increase our participation in emerging markets such as automotive 
income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november   and amounted to million  million  and  respectively 
as a result of certain deferred tax assets  we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be less than income tax expense for fiscal as of november   our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year  including scheduled long term debt repayment  lease commitments  planned capital equipment expenditures  research and development expenses  and possible stock repurchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
despite increases in certain working capital requirements in  our operating cash flow remained strong 
net cash generated by operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal accounts receivable turnover rates improved in  primarily reflecting the successful integration of collection efforts for our acquired businesses 
despite increased sales volume and production requirements  aggregate inventories decreased by  in fiscal year  excluding the impact of our acquired businesses 
this inventory reduction was achieved through numerous inventory control procedures  including material substitutions and reduced manufacturing cycle times 
net cash generated by operating activities amounted to million in with greater sales volume in  accounts receivable increased by million 
at november   goodwill represented of our total assets and of our stockholders equity 
in addition to a total of million of goodwill recognized in connection with our recent acquisitions of jdk  amplifonix  cbu and sei  another million of goodwill was realized in earlier acquisitions including our purchase of substantially all of the assets of the signal conditioning products division of amp incorporated in in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november   and 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos and chinese yuan 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we did not have any material forward currency exchange contracts outstanding 
for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material 
interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 
environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 
in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced that it would provide a phased in implementation process for sfas no 
r 
as a result of this phased in process  the provisions of sfas no 
r must be adopted by most public entities no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year commencing after june  sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
effective for our fiscal year beginning december   we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r using a modified version of prospective application 
under this transition method  compensation cost will be recognized on or after the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards previously calculated under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 for pro forma disclosures 
effective june   we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options previously awarded to employees  officers and directors of the company under our stock option plans 
an option was considered out of the money if the stated exercise price was greater than  the closing price of the company s common stock on june  with this action  options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock that would otherwise have vested at various times within the next four years became fully vested 
as a result of accelerating the vesting of these out of the money stock options  we expect to reduce the stock option expense we otherwise would be required to record by  after taxes  based upon value calculations using the black scholes methodology  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal 
in addition  in november  fully vested options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were granted to certain employees and directors  which had the effect of increasing the company s pro forma stock based compensation expense by  net of related taxes 
except for the impact of these options  and the accelerated vesting of the out of the money stock options  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an effect on our results of operations similar to the amounts reported historically in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements under the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

previous guidance regarding the accounting for nonmonetary assets was based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
this previous guidance  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception of nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of sfas no 
are generally effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
the statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractible to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
in addition  the statement also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long lived assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the provisions of sfas no 
are generally effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customer s financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due 
at november   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable 
in determining the adequacy of this allowance  we have assumed that market conditions in the telecommunications equipment industry will continue to improve throughout fiscal if this improvement does not occur  or if current market conditions deteriorate  our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
accordingly  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
at november   we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of million for excess and slow moving items 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage 
should these forecasts and estimates change due to market  technological or other factors  the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values 
we review goodwill for possible impairment at least annually 
impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors  including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
however  our future cash flow expectations assume that market conditions throughout the telecommunications equipment industry will continue to improve 
if long term market conditions do not improve  our long lived assets may become materially impaired 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
presently  we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed
