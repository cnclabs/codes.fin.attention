item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this form k should be read in conjunction with our disclosure under the heading safe harbor statement under the united states private securities litigation reform act of on page general pure cycle is an investor owned water and wastewater service provider engaged in the design  operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems 
we operate primarily in the denver metropolitan area and own nearly  acre feet of groundwater in the denver area 
we also own approximately  acre feet of arkansas river water  we have the exclusive rights to use over  acre feet of groundwater located at the lowry range property through the year  and we own  acre feet of conditional water rights on the western slope of colorado 
we plan to utilize our denver assets and our arkansas river water to provide large scale residential commercial water and wastewater services to customers located along the front range of colorado 
we are also exploring new ways to use our western slope water for municipal or agricultural purposes along the western slope of colorado 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we have identified certain key accounting policies on which our financial condition and results of operations are dependent 
these key accounting policies most often involve complex matters and are based on subjective judgments or decisions 
in the opinion of management  our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  impairment of water assets and other long lived assets  depletion and depreciation  accounting for participating interests in export water  tap participation fees  royalty and other obligations  and income taxes 
management periodically reviews its estimates  including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates 
revenue recognition our revenues consist mainly of tap fees  construction fees and monthly service fees 
emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  governs how to identify when goods or services  or both  that are separately delivered but included in a single sales arrangement should be accounted for individually 
based on the criteria of eitf  we account for each of the items contained in our service agreements individually 
that is  we determine the proper revenue recognition for tap fees  construction fees and services fees independent of one another 
proceeds from tap sales and construction fees are deferred upon receipt and recognized in income based on whether we own or do not own the facilities constructed with the proceeds 
tap fees and construction fees derived from agreements for which we construct infrastructure the customer will own are recognized in accordance with statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  whereby we recognize tap fees and construction fees as revenue and costs of construction based on the percentage of completion method 
tap fees and construction fees derived from agreements for which we will own the infrastructure are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  whereby the up front fees are recognized ratably over the estimated service life of the facilities constructed  starting at completion of construction 
because we own these facilities  we capitalize construction costs and amortize those as costs of revenue over the assets estimated useful life 
we recognize water and wastewater usage revenues upon delivery of water and collection of wastewater  in the month in which the services are performed 
water service fees are based upon metered water deliveries to customers plus base charges 
wastewater customers are charged flat monthly fees 
impairment of water assets and other long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows we expect to be generated by the eventual use of the asset the fair value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we believe there were no impairments in the carrying amounts of our investments in water and water systems at august  accounting for caa payments the balance sheet liability captioned participating interests in export water supply the participating interests represents an obligation which arose under the water commercialization agreement the wca  as amended by the caa 
upon entering into the caa  we recorded an initial liability of approximately million  which represents the cash we received and used to purchase our export water supply 
in return we agreed to remit a total of million of proceeds received from the sale of export water to the participating interest holders 
in accordance with eitf issue no sales of future revenues  the obligation for the million was recorded as debt  and the remaining million contingent liability is not reflected on our balance sheet because the obligation to pay this is contingent on sales of export water  the amounts and timing of which are not reasonably determinable 
as of august   the remaining participating interests liability reflected on our balance sheet totaled million  and the contingent liability not reflected on our balance sheet totaled million 
for more information see note participating interests in export water to the accompanying financial statements 
tap participation fees on august  we acquired  acre feet of arkansas river water along with real property and other associated rights 
as consideration for these assets we agreed to pay hp a m  among other items  of our tap fees on the sale of the next  water taps  of which   water taps remain to be paid during the due diligence period specified in the arkansas river agreement  hp a m sold certain property rights which pursuant to the arkansas river agreement were deemed in effect tap participation fee payments  the value of these equated to taps under the tap participation section of the arkansas river agreement 
this purchase was accounted for pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations sfas 
due to the fact that the tap participation fee is payable to hp a m based on the tap fees in effect at the time of the sale of the taps and due to our inability to reasonably identify the start date of the required payments or the timing of the required payments  we are not able to reasonably estimate the total tap participation fees payable to hp a m 
since the arkansas river agreement calls for contingent payments that might be considered additional costs of the asset at the date when paid  sfas required us to record a liability equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired assets over the fair value of the purchase consideration 
this liability is non interest bearing and will only be paid once we receive tap fees 
for more information see note water  water systems and service agreements in the accompanying financial statements 
contingent obligations payable upon default by hp a m certain of the properties we acquired are subject to outstanding promissory notes and accrued interest totaling approximately million  which are secured by deeds of trust on the properties acquired 
we did not assume any of these promissory notes  and we are not responsible for making any of the required payments under these notes 
this responsibility remained solely with hp a m 
in the event of default by hp a m  at our sole discretion  we have the option to assume any of the notes in default and make payments pursuant to the notes 
if hp a m defaults on the promissory notes  we can foreclose on a defined amount of stock issued to hp a m being held in escrow and reduce the tap participation fee by two times the amount of notes defaulted on by hp a m 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb financial interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others as amended  our option to assume hp a m s obligations under any defaulted promissory notes is considered an indirect guarantee of debt because if we do not cure the default we would lose some of the acquired land and water rights 
thus  the outstanding balance of the promissory notes has been reflected as a liability in the accompanying balance sheet 
additionally  we have recorded a receivable in our equity section from hp a m for the same amount as the liability  since we would recover any amounts paid in the event of default by hp a m by recovering stock and tap participation fee interests from hp a m 
the recorded liability and the contra equity receivable will be reduced as hp a m makes its scheduled payments to the note holders 
royalty and other obligations revenues from the sale of export water are shown net of royalties payable to the land board 
revenues from the sale of water on the lowry range property are shown net of the royalties to the land board and the fees retained by the district 
depletion and depreciation of water assets water supplies that are being utilized are depleted on the basis of units produced divided by the total volume of water adjudicated in the water decrees 
water systems are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets until realization is more likely than not 
results of operations executive summary the results of our operations for the years ended august   and were as follows millions of gallons of water delivered water revenues water delivery operating costs gross margin wastewater treatment revenues wastewater treatment operating costs gross margin general and administrative expenses water and wastewater usage revenues during fiscal and we delivered approximately the same amount of water to our customers 
however  due to increased water usage fees in fiscal and  the fiscal water usage revenues are higher than fiscal during fiscal water deliveries were down  which is mainly due to the front range experiencing more precipitation in then in  and therefore  our customers used less water for irrigation purposes 
however  because of the higher rates in fiscal  the water usage charges exceeded that of fiscal fiscal usage fees were higher than fiscal due to higher water usage and higher rates 
our water service charges are based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water 
our rates and charges are established based on the average of three surrounding communities  referred to as our rate based districts 
table included above in item description of business  outlines our tiered pricing structure and changes during fiscal  and  respectively 
usage fees increased effective july  and july   which was based on increases at our rate based districts 
our wastewater customers are charged flat monthly fees based on the number of tap connections they have 
wastewater usage fees increased july  from to per wastewater tap per month  which accounts for the changes in revenues between the fiscal years 
gross margins for water and wastewater operations have remained consistent in all three years presented  with the exception of the wastewater margin in which was impacted by certain costs incurred to increase the efficiency of the system 
during fiscal  and for all years presented  we reclassified certain energy bills from general and administrative expenses to water delivery operating costs to more accurately reflect the costs of delivering the water 
general and administrative and other expenses general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended august  were impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r 
for fiscal we recorded stock based compensation expense of  there was no stock based compensation recorded in fiscal or without stock based compensation expenses  general and administrative expenses in fiscal would have been  this is an increase over fiscal general and administrative expenses of  and an increase of  over fiscal general and administrative expenses 
other increases in general and administrative expenses for the three fiscal years presented are due mainly to the following factors salaries and related expenses including sfas r expenses and healthcare costs totaled approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
without the effects of sfas r  salary and related expenses in fiscal would have been  which is an increase over fiscal of  this increase is mainly attributable to a  bonus to our president in fiscal versus a  bonus in fiscal offset by reduced monthly salary and healthcare expenses due to the passing away of our former ceo in june professional fees totaled approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
this increase is a result of higher audit and audit related fees and increased legal expenses due to certain transactions completed in fiscal and fees related to our board of directors totaled approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
board and related fees have increased since fiscal due to the addition of several new committees and the addition of a new board member in each of fiscal and each time we add a new board member  that member receives  which is then paid annually and an option to purchase  shares of the common stock 
board members receive per meeting that they attend  in person or telephonically 
this account also includes the amortization of the premiums we pay for directors and officers insurance 
we entered into various insurance policies related to the construction of the fairground water system which cost approximately  during fiscal the above increases are offset by the following decreases public entity costs were   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
public entity costs increased in fiscal due mainly to higher franchise taxes due to our secondary offering in late fiscal which increased our shares outstanding combined with an increase in our authorized shares and net assets 
in late fiscal we decreased the number of shares authorized and therefore our franchise taxes decreased substantially 
public entity costs also includes the annual listing costs paid to nasdaq which increased as a result of additional shares outstanding due to option exercises and other stock issuances 
decreases in funding requests by the district 
the expensed portions of the funding requests paid to the district totaled   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and funding requests vary depending on the water usage revenues generated and the level of operations at the district 
interest income totaled approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  which is interest earned on the temporary investment of capital in available for sale securities and interest accrued on the note payable by the district 
the increase from to was due primarily to funds being invested in securities for all of versus a few months in offset by a lower prime rate  which is the base factor in the district s note receivable 
the increase from to is due to higher interest rates on the temporary investment of funds and higher prime rate  both due to the federal reserve raising rates consistently throughout fiscal interest expense related parties was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the significant decrease from to was due to repayments of related party debt 
in late fiscal we retired million of related party debt which included accrued interest and in december we retired  of related party debt which included accrued interest 
see note in the accompanying financial statements 
interest expense non related parties was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to increases in interest rates 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to decreases in interest rates when the federal reserve was lowering interest rates 
in august  we extinguished all remaining notes payable with non related parties  which is described further in note to the accompanying financial statements 
based on this  as of august   we longer have any interest accruing debt instruments 
our net losses in fiscal  and were approximately  million and million  respectively 
the decreases in the net losses for each year are mainly attributable to the reasons noted above  and in fiscal we recorded a gain on the extinguishment of caa obligations and non related party debt totaling approximately  liquidity and capital resources our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  at august  was approximately million  and we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand totaling million at august  we believe that at august   we have sufficient working capital to fund our operations for the next year 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing the water from our primary water projects in the near term 
in the event increased revenues and cash flows from providing water and wastewater services are not achieved  we may incur additional short or long term debt or seek to sell additional equity securities to generate working capital to support our operations 
development of the water that we own  have rights to use  or may seek to acquire  will require substantial capital investments 
we anticipate that capital required for the development of the water and wastewater systems will be financed through the sale of water taps to developers and water delivery charges to users 
a water tap charge refers to a charge we impose to fund construction of wholesale facilities and permit access to a water delivery system eg  a single family home s tap into our water system  and a water service charge refers to a water customer s monthly water bill  generally charged per  gallons of water delivered to the customer 
we anticipate tap fees will be sufficient to generate funds with which we can design and construct the necessary wholesale facilities 
however  once we receive tap fees from a developer  we are contractually obligated to construct the wholesale facilities for the taps paid for  even if our costs are not covered by the fees we receive 
we can not assure you that our source of cash will be sufficient to cover all our capital costs 
on august   we finalized the arkansas river agreement whereby we purchased approximately  acre feet of arkansas river water  real property and certain other related assets 
as consideration for these assets  in addition to other consideration  we agreed to pay hp a m of our tap fees received on the sale of the next  water taps 
we can not reasonably estimate how much will ultimately be paid to hp a m but expect it to be in excess of million 
tap participation payments are not payable to hp a m until we receive tap fees 
the recorded liability on our balance sheet is a non interest bearing liability and is more fully described in the critical accounting policies tap participation fee section above 
we are obligated to pay the flcc water assessment charges which are the charges assessed to the flcc shareholders for the upkeep and maintenance of the fort lyon canal 
based on historical information obtained from hp a m  we anticipate paying water assessment charges of approximately  annually 
see contingent obligations payable upon default by hp a m in the critical accounting policies section above regarding our option to assume certain promissory notes in the event of default by hp a m 
on august   we entered into the county agreement to provide water service to the fairgrounds 
pursuant to the county agreement  funding of million for the construction of the special facilities will come from the county and will be provided as follows i an initial payment of  received in august  and ii  paid over ten years  which includes interest at  which based on currently scheduled payments will result in us receiving  in interest 
upon the delivery of a water rights warranty deed by the county to us for approximately acre feet of groundwater  the amount payable over ten years will be reduced by approximately  which is the value of groundwater 
in accordance with sab  upon completion of construction of the fairgrounds facilities and the initiation of water service to the fairgrounds in july  we began ratably recognizing tap fee revenue as income 
the tap fees received from the county are being recognized in income over the estimate useful life of the constructed assets  or years 
as of august   we recognized revenues of approximately  representing one month of income 
on october   and then on may   we entered into the sky ranch agreements with the developer of sky ranch 
pursuant to the sky ranch agreements we will provide water for all homes and buildings to be constructed at sky ranch  which could go as high as  sfe units 
pursuant to the sky ranch agreements  the developer must purchase at least water taps before occupancy of the first home 
the sky ranch agreements permit the developer to add additional taps annually  with at least taps to be purchased each year after construction begins 
this schedule is designed to provide us with adequate funds with which to construct the wholesale facilities needed to provide water service to the areas being developed 
to the extent that water service is provided using export water  we are required to pay a royalty to the land board equal to of the net revenue after deducting direct and indirect costs  including a reasonable charge for overhead  associated with the withdrawal  treatment and delivery of export water 
if the developer exercises its option to purchase export water  we expect to dedicate approximately  acre feet  or approximately  of our export water supply which is about of our overall rangeview water supply for the sky ranch project 
we estimate we will spend approximately million for infrastructure costs related to the development and delivery of water to the sky ranch development 
at august   we had outstanding debt to one related party totaling approximately  all other interest bearing notes were repaid or extinguished during fiscal as described in the accompanying financial statements 
the remaining note payable is due in october and does not accrue interest 
operating activities operating activities include revenues we receive from the sale of water and wastewater services to our customers  costs incurred in the delivery of those services  general and administrative expenses  and depletion depreciation expenses 
cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and respectively 
cash used in operations decreased from fiscal to due to lower salaries following the passing away of our former ceo and decreased health insurance costs for the same reason and because we switched to a new insurance provider  offset by an increase in management bonuses and increased board of director fees  annual retainers  and insurance 
the increase from fiscal to was mainly due to management bonuses  increased health care costs  higher board fees and higher legal and accounting fees 
during fiscal  and we accrued interest on the note receivable from the district of approximately   and  respectively 
the increase is caused by increases in interest rates 
these amounts were offset by decreases in accrued interest on notes payable of approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in interest expense are due to the extinguishment of  of principal and accrued interest in august  the repayment of  of notes payable to a related party in december and the repayment of million of debt along with approximately million of accrued interest in fiscal following the extinguishment of the debt in august  we no longer have any interest bearing notes outstanding so cash required for operations during fiscal related to debt should remain lower than in previous years 
we will continue to provide domestic water and wastewater service to customers in our service area and we will continue to operate and maintain our water and wastewater systems with our own employees 
investing activities we continue to invest in the acquisition  development and maintenance of our water systems 
on august  we acquired the arkansas river water  represented by the shares in the flcc and certain other real and personal property  in exchange for equity and a tap participation fee payable when we sell water taps 
we expended  related to legal and engineering costs associated with this acquisition  which have been capitalized as part of the costs of the acquired assets and have accrued an additional  of legal and engineering costs which were paid in fiscal during fiscal  we invested approximately million in the construction of the facilities required to provide water service to the fairgrounds which was completed in july however  we anticipate certain expenditures related to the construction to continue in fiscal  which have been accrued as of august  we intend to exercise our rights to acquire the next of the sky ranch groundwater pursuant to the agreement for the purchase of denver aquifer groundwater for  in fiscal  was due in fiscal and we are currently working with the developer of sky ranch on finalizing this purchase but the purchase was not recorded during fiscal because we had not received the water rights deed as of year end nor have we received the deed as of the date of this filing 
we also continue to invest in legal and engineering fees associated with certain water rights  and we continue to invest in the right of way permit fees to the department of interior bureau of land management and legal and engineering costs for our paradise water supply 
cash provided by used in investing activities for fiscal  and was approximately million   and million  respectively 
as noted above the most significant investments in fiscal related to the construction of the fairgrounds water system and costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the arkansas river water 
during fiscal  we maintained temporary investments of funds generated from the equity offering in fiscal and capitalized approximately  of costs related to our water assets  which included approximately  related to the start of construction of the fairgrounds water system 
during fiscal  we received option payments totaling  from the developer of sky ranch related to the potential use of export water 
fiscal included the initial investment of funds from the equity offering and the receipt of  of sky ranch option fees 
we capitalize certain acquisition  legal  engineering and permitting costs relating to the improvement of our water assets 
as of august   sky ranch option payments totaling  are past due 
we are working with the developer of sky ranch to collect these amounts but have no assurances as to when the amounts will be paid 
financing activities cash provided by financing during fiscal  and was approximately  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal the main financing item was million of cash received from persons exercising outstanding options and warrants offset by  of debt payments to retire debt with our former ceo and  paid to caa holders related to the county agreement 
fiscal cash provided by financing activities included the receipt of approximately  related to exercises of stock options and the receipt of  of special facilities funding from the county 
fiscal cash provided by financing activities included the receipt of approximately million from the sale of stock in the equity offering and from the exercise of warrants 
the equity offering proceeds were partially offset by the repurchase of certain caa interests for million in cash and repayment of million of debt 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r which is a revision of sfas and addresses the accounting for employee stock options

our liability arises if hp a m defaults on its promissory notes and we choose to meet their obligations 
because we can not reasonably estimate when or if hp a m will default on the promissory notes  and therefore can not reasonably estimate when  or if  we will choose to expend our current assets to cure hp a m s default  we can not estimate the cash requirements by period on the company related to these promissory notes 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
pure cycle is exposed to market risks that may impact the balance sheets  statements of operations  and statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest rates and changes in tap fees and usage rates at our rate based districts 
additionally  due to the promissory notes on the land we acquired which we may elect to pay in the event of default by hp a m  we are subject to market risks impacting the ability of hp a m to make the required payments 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding these market risks 
interest rates 
the primary objective for our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of united states treasury obligations and other investment grade debt securities 
as of august   the fair value of our investments was approximately million with maturity dates through december a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
rates and charges 
our rates and charges are based on the average of our rate based districts and could vary dramatically from year to year 
the rates charged by our rate based districts might not provide us sufficient funds to support our operations and capital required to fund construction activities 
based on the increases in taps fees and usage charges at our rate based districts over the last several years as noted in table above  we expect rates and charges to continue to be sufficient to meet our operational and construction needs 
promissory notes we  at our sole discretion  have the option  in the event of default on promissory notes by hp a m  to assume hp a m s liability for said promissory notes which are secured by deeds of trust on the land we acquired from hp a m 
to mitigate the risk of loss to the company  we have the ability to recover the costs we might incur on the promissory notes by foreclosing on pure cycle common stock held in escrow that is owned by hp a m and we can reduce the tap participation fees payable to hp a m by twice the amount of promissory notes in default
