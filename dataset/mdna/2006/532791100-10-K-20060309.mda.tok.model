item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we continue to pursue a strategy of increasing market share in existing and surrounding geographic markets through internal growth and selective acquisition of local and regional companies 
in addition  we will continue to expand into new geographic markets on a selective basis  either through acquisition or by opening new operating centers  when we believe it will enhance our business 
our focus remains primarily on oxygen and other respiratory therapy services  which represent approximately of our revenues 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lincare holdings inc and its subsidiaries 
we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition our revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
insurance benefits are assigned to the company and  accordingly  the company bills on behalf of its customers 
the company s billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
if the payment amount received differs from the net realizable amount  an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in the period that these payment differences are determined 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab for determining when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of sab that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products and or services are delivered 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review by either the company or a third party intermediary 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for equipment and supplies delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is probable and that unbilled accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payors 
billing delays  ranging from several weeks to several months  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and business acquisitions awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that the third party does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
we perform analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  we consider historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that our estimates could change  which could have a material impact on our operations and cash flows 
bad debt expense and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts receivable 
our proprietary management information systems are utilized to provide this data in order to assess bad debts 
in the event that collection results of existing accounts receivable are not consistent with historical experience  there may be a need to establish an additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which may materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
business acquisition accounting and amortization expense the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  provide guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles for business acquisitions 
we apply the purchase method of accounting for business acquisitions  and use available cash from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the assumption of certain liabilities as the consideration for business acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of our business acquisitions based on the fair market value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
the difference between the total cost of the acquisition and the sum of the fair values of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
until the end of  goodwill was amortized over a period of years 
the assignment of a year life was based on each acquisition s ability to generate sufficient operating results to support the recorded goodwill balance 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
which required that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized and instead be tested annually for impairment 
accordingly  no amortization expense related to goodwill was recorded in the financial statements since we assess the impairment of intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  without limitation  i significant under performance of acquired assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv increased competitive pressures  v a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and vi technological and regulatory changes 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the ability to recover those assets 
if those assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
contingencies we are involved in certain claims and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles related to contingencies 
we evaluate and record liabilities for contingencies based on known claims and legal actions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we have concluded that accrued liabilities related to contingencies are appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
net revenues the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of our net revenues by product category year ended december  in thousands oxygen and other respiratory therapy home medical equipment and other total net revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  a decrease of below net revenues for the decrease in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth offset by reductions in medicare reimbursement of

net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  an increase of over the increase in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth offset by reductions in medicare reimbursement of 
medicare reimbursement reductions for inhalation drugs in reduced net revenues in the year by million 
the internal growth in net revenues is attributable to underlying growth in the market for our products estimated at annually and increased market share resulting primarily from our sales and marketing efforts that emphasize high quality equipment and customer service 
growth in net revenues from acquisitions is attributable to the effects of acquisitions of local and regional companies and is estimated based on the contribution to net revenues for the four quarters following such acquisitions 
during and  we completed the acquisition of businesses with annual revenues of approximately million and businesses with annual revenues of approximately million  respectively 
the contribution of oxygen and other respiratory therapy products to our net revenues was  and  respectively  for the years ended december   and our strategy is to focus on the provision of oxygen and other respiratory therapy services to patients in the home and to provide home medical equipment and other services where we believe such services will enhance our core respiratory business 
cost of goods and services cost of goods and services includes the cost of equipment excluding depreciation  drugs and supplies sold to patients and certain operating costs related to the company s respiratory pharmacy operations 
these costs include an allocation of customer service  distribution and administrative costs relating to the respiratory pharmacy operations of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cost of goods and services expressed as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the relationships of costs to net revenues during the periods were impacted by the medicare price reductions discussed above see net revenues 
the increase in cost of goods and services in is attributable primarily to increased patient and drug shipment volumes and an increase in drug purchasing costs due to a product mix shift to higher cost branded products in our inhalation drug business 
the improvement in over is attributable primarily to the achievement of more favorable pricing terms with our vendors and growth in higher gross margin respiratory product lines 
operating and other expenses operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively

the relationships of expenses to net revenues during the periods were impacted by the medicare price reductions discussed above see net revenues 
the improvements in sg a resulted from cost controls and productivity gains at our overhead locations and lower advertising expenses  which partially offset the impact of the medicare price cuts 
bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the years ended december   and we have achieved favorable results in accounts receivable collections over the past three years and overall days sales outstanding dso were days at december   up from days at december  and down from days at december  while we have achieved consistent results in managing bad debt expense over the past three years  continued growth in the pace of our acquisition program may contribute to an increase in our bad debt expense in the future 
the integration of acquired companies into our regional billing and collections offices may temporarily disrupt collections  increasing the amount of accounts receivable written off as uncollectible 
depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december  compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill resulting from business acquisitions completed after june  has not been amortized 
goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions before july  have been amortized through december  goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations completed after june  during  we amortized million of intangible assets compared with million in and million in our net intangible assets were billion as of december  of this total  million consisting of various covenants not to compete is being amortized over periods of one to seven years 
operating income as shown in the table below  operating income for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in operating income in is attributable primarily to the reduction of medicare reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs and certain items of dme effective january   decreased reimbursement rates for oxygen equipment that took effect on april  and increased costs of purchased inhalation drugs  partially offset by customer volume growth  gains in labor productivity and control over operating costs 
the increase in operating income in was a result of growth in our net revenues through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions  favorable product purchasing costs resulting from negotiations with our vendors  and gains in labor productivity which limited the growth in our salary and related expenses 
we estimate that the reductions in medicare reimbursement rates reduced net revenues and operating income in and by approximately million and million  respectively

the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets  and million to goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from equity and debt transactions 
we have used these funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of operational needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
at december   our working capital was million  as compared to million at december  the decline in working capital is primarily attributable to our use of million to repurchase shares of our common stock in net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  a significant portion of our assets consists of accounts receivable from third party payors that are responsible for payment for the equipment and services we provide 
our dso was days as of december  and days as of december  we measure our dso by dividing our net accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by the product of our latest quarterly net revenues times four  multiplied by days 
net cash used in investing and financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the year ended december  included our investment of million in business acquisitions  net investment in capital equipment of million  net payments of debt of million  proceeds of million from issuance of common stock and million in payments to acquire treasury stock

the revolving credit agreement  dated april   makes available to us up to million over a five year period  subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the agreement 
we believe that internally generated funds  together with funds that may be borrowed under our revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements and financial obligations 
we believe that our credit standing provides us with adequate access to financial markets 
on october   the board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased million of its common stock pursuant to the plan 
total common stock held in treasury at cost was million at december  on february   the board authorized a new share repurchase plan whereby the company may repurchase  from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  shares of the company s common stock in amounts determined pursuant to a formula that takes into account both the ratio of the company s net debt to cash flow and its available cash resources and borrowing availability 
on june   we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures in a private placement 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of debentures 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
on june   we sold an additional million principal amount of debentures pursuant to the exercise in full of an over allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the debentures 
the debentures are convertible into common stock in any calendar quarter if  among other circumstances  the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our previous calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price per share per share of our common stock on such last trading day 
interest on the debentures is payable at the rate of per annum on june and december of each year 
the debentures are senior unsecured obligations and will mature on june  the debentures are redeemable by us on or after june  and may be put to us for repurchase on june     or our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon our operating cash flow and management of accounts receivable 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next months

 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
under the regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  we are required to apply sfas no 
r as of january  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
the modified prospective method requires compensation cost to be recognized beginning january  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after december  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on january  the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits companies to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we have adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 prior to january  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options and stock purchase plans 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method from sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of sfas no 
r would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods of adoption as a result of the classification requirements of the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
inflation we have not experienced material increases in either the cost of supplies or operating expenses due to inflation  however  we estimate that increases in gasoline prices resulted in higher fuel costs of approximately million in with reductions in reimbursement by government and private medical insurance programs and pressure to contain the costs of such programs  we bear the risk that reimbursement rates set by such programs will not keep pace with inflation

the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments 
we maintain a decentralized approach to management of our local business operations 
decentralization of managerial decision making enables our operating centers to respond promptly and effectively to local market demands and opportunities 
we provide home health care equipment and services through operating centers in states 
we view each operating center as a distinct part of a single operating segment  as each operating center generally provides the same products to customers 
as a result  all of our operating centers are aggregated into one reportable segment
