overview we are primarily engaged in the production  grading  packing  and sale of fresh shell eggs 
our fiscal year end is the saturday nearest to may which was june  weeks  may  weeks and may  weeks for the most recent three fiscal years 
our operations are fully integrated 
at our facilities we hatch chicks  grow pullets  manufacture feed  and produce  process  and distribute shell eggs 
we currently are the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the united states 
shell eggs accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and in fiscal egg products accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and none in fiscal we primarily market our shell eggs in the southwestern  southeastern  mid western and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
shell eggs are sold directly by us primarily to national and regional supermarket chains 
we currently use contract producers for approximately of our total egg production 
contract producers operate under agreements with us for the use of their facilities in the production of shell eggs by layers owned by us 
we also own the eggs produced 
also  shell eggs are purchased  as needed  for resale by us from outside producers 
our operating income or loss is significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which can fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in egg production during the spring and early summer 
our cost of production is materially affected by feed costs  which average about of our total farm egg production cost 
changes in feed costs result in changes in our cost of goods sold 
the cost of feed ingredients is affected by a number of supply and demand factors such as crop production and weather  and other factors  such as the level of grain exports  over which we have little or no control

our working capital at june  was million compared to million at may  our current ratio was at june  as compared with at may  our need for working capital generally is highest in the first and second fiscal quarters ending in august and november 
during the first quarter shell egg prices are normally at seasonal lows 
in the second quarter  we usually build inventory balances in anticipation of the holiday season 
seasonal borrowing needs frequently are higher during these periods than during other fiscal periods 
we have a million line of credit with three banks  million of which was utilized as a standby letter of credit at june  our long term debt at that date  including current maturities  totaled million  as compared to million at may  for the fiscal year ended june   million in net cash was provided by operating activities

the net result was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
substantially all trade receivables and inventories collateralize our line of credit and property  plant and equipment collateralize our long term debt under our loan agreements with our lenders 
unless otherwise approved by our lenders  we are required by provisions of these loan agreements to maintain minimum levels of working capital ratio of not less than to and net worth minimum of million tangible net worth  and of cumulative net income  limit dividends to an aggregate amount not to exceed  per quarter allowed if no default  capital expenditures not to exceed depreciation for the same four fiscal quarters  lease obligations and additional long term borrowings total funded debt to total capitalization not to exceed  and maintain various current and cash flow coverage ratios to  among other restrictions 
at june   we were in compliance with the provisions of all loan agreements 
under certain of the loan agreements  the lenders have the option to require the prepayment of any outstanding borrowings in the event we undergo a change in control 
under the terms of our agreement with hillandale and the hillandale shareholders  the egg production and marketing operations acquired and liabilities assumed by us were transferred to a new florida limited liability company named hillandale  llc 
the two hillandale companies were the initial members of hillandale  llc  for formation purposes 
upon the completion of an evaluation of the assets and liabilities acquired and assumed by us  as agreed to by the parties to the agreement  we purchased of the units of membership in hillandale  llc 
the remaining of the units of membership in hillandale  llc  are to be acquired in essentially equal annual installments over a four year period  with the purchase price of the units equal to their book value as calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the acquisition was made for cash and borrowings to the extent necessary 
funding of the remaining units of membership of hillandale is expected to be provided by our cash balances  cash provided by operations and our revolving credit agreement 
we project capital expenditures  excluding any future acquisitions  of an aggregate of approximately million during fiscal we currently have a million deferred tax liability due to a subsidiary s change from a cash basis to an accrual basis taxpayer on may  the taxpayer relief act of provides that this liability is payable ratably over the years beginning in fiscal however  such taxes will be due in their entirety in the first fiscal year in which there is a change in ownership control so that we no longer qualify as a family farming corporation 
we are currently making annual payments of approximately  related to this liability 
however  while these current payments reduce cash balances  payment of the million deferred tax liability would not impact our consolidated statement of operations or stockholders equity  as these taxes have been accrued and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our existing cash and investments  as well as our unused lines of credit  if needed  will satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under securities and exchange commission regulations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments  in thousands  to be made under existing contractual obligations 
further information on debt obligations is contained in note  and on lease obligations in note  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table does not reflect the obligations incurred by us for the hillandale acquisition  the exact amounts of which are to be determined under the terms of the agreement 
at the closing of the hillandale transaction on october   we purchased of the units of membership in hillandale  llc 
we will incur costs  which cannot now be estimated  for our purchase of the remaining of the units of membership over the four year period following the closing 
total over years long term debt operating leases total impact of recently issued accounting standards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r required companies to measure compensation costs for share based payments to employees  including stock options  at fair value and expense such compensation over the service period beginning with the first annual period after december  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we adopted sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion  at the date of adoption  of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards 
companies are required to recognize a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal  net of any tax effect  to reflect the difference between the intrinsic value and fair value of liability awards on the date of adoption 
statement r also requires a portion of the benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
no change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method 
management expects the cumulative effect adjustment will be insignificant in the period of adoption 
on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with statement and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  interpretation provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating whether the adoption of interpretation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect sfas no 
to have a significant impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management suggests that our summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  generally for amounts more than days past due 
inventories 
inventories of eggs  feed  supplies and livestock are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower  we would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value 
the cost associated with flock inventories  consisting principally of chick purchases  feed  labor  contractor payments and overhead costs  are accumulated during the growing period of approximately weeks 
capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the productive lives of the flocks  generally one to two years 
flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal adjustments to write down flock inventories 
management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss 
long lived assets 
depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
we continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
investment in affiliates 
we have invested in other companies engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from less than to 
therefore  these investments are recorded using the cost or the equity method  and accordingly  not consolidated in our financial statements 
changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used 
our investment in these companies amounted to million at june  the combined total assets and total liabilities of these companies were approximately million and million  respectively  at june  we are a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of one of the affiliates 
goodwill 
at june   our goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill relates to the fiscal acquisition of hudson brothers  inc  and the fiscal acquisition of hillandale farms  llc 
we adopted  as of june   statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
an impairment loss would be recorded if the recorded goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we have only one operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment at the entity level 
significant adverse industry or economic changes  or other factors not anticipated could result in an impairment charge to reduce recorded goodwill 
income taxes 
we determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we are periodically audited by taxing authorities 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate 
forward looking statements 
the foregoing statements contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties and our actual experience may differ materially from that discussed above 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors affecting future performance below  as well as future events that have the effect of reducing our available cash balances  such as unanticipated operating losses or capital expenditures related to possible future acquisitions 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update forward looking statements 
factors affecting future performance 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors which are beyond our control 
these include adverse changes in shell egg prices and in the grain markets 
accordingly  past trends should not be used to anticipate future results and trends 
further  our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we maintain certain of our debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a adverse move decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the net fair value of our debt by million at june  we are a party to no other market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
