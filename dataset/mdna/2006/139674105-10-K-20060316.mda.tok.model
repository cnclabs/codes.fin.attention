growth in earnings was attributable to strong growth in operating revenues as reflected by growth in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income 
taxable equivalent net interest income grew over due to earning asset growth and an improved net interest margin 
net interest margin percentage improved basis points to driven by an improved earning asset mix and higher earning asset yields

the increase in operating revenue was driven by a increase in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income 
the growth in net interest income for reflects earning asset growth and an improved net interest margin 
higher deposit service charge fees  mortgage banking revenues  asset management fees  and merchant services fees drove the increase in noninterest income 
the increase in noninterest expense is primarily attributable to higher operating costs associated with the integration of two recent acquisitions  which added new offices to the capital city franchise  and marketing costs supporting our new absolutely free checking product

interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a tax rate to adjust interest on tax exempt loans and securities to a taxable equivalent basis 
reflects difference in day year and versus day year 
for the year  taxable equivalent interest income increased million  or  over  and increased million  or  in over growth in was driven by strong organic loan growth  loans acquired in connection with recent acquisitions  and higher yields on earning assets 
rising interest rates  coupled with new loan production and the repricing of existing earning assets were the primary factors contributing to a basis point improvement in the yield on earning assets  which increased from in to for this compares to an basis point reduction in over as shown in table  the loan portfolio was a significant contributor to the increase in interest income 
interest expense increased million  or  over  and million  or  in over rising interest rates and growth in interest bearing liabilities drove the increase in however  the impact of rising rates was partially offset by a shift in mix  as certificates of deposit generally a higher cost deposit product declined relative to total deposits 
certificates of deposit  as a percent of total average deposits  declined from in to in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in increased basis points compared to  reflecting both deposit competition and the federal reserve s continued increases in the federal funds target rate 
our interest rate spread defined as the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points in and decreased basis points in the increase in was primarily attributable to the higher yields on earning assets 
our net interest margin defined as taxable equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets was in  compared to in and in in  the higher yields on earning assets partially offset by higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities resulted in a basis point improvement in the margin 
loan growth is anticipated to have a favorable impact on net interest income during the upcoming year along with any further increases in the federal reserve s target rate on overnight funds 
however  these improvements will be partially offset by the rising cost of funds 
a further discussion of our earning assets and funding sources can be found in the section entitled financial condition 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million in and million in the loan loss provisions in both and were impacted by a re assessment of the reserve to reflect the changing risk profile associated with the bank s sale of its credit card portfolio during the third quarter of and the addition of recent acquisitions

management considers the allowance to be adequate based on the current level of nonperforming loans and the estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at year end 
see the section entitled financial condition and tables and for further information regarding the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income in  noninterest income excluding the before tax gain of million on the sale of the bank s credit card portfolio in august increased million  or  over primarily due to higher deposit service charge fees  asset management fees  mortgage banking revenues  and merchant services fees 
noninterest income excluding the above referenced gain for increased million  or  over the increase primarily reflects a higher level of deposit service charge fees  asset management fees  data processing fees  and merchant services fees  partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenues

service charges on deposit accounts 
deposit service charge fees increased million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in deposit service charge revenues in any one year are dependent on the number of accounts  primarily transaction accounts  the level of activity subject to service charges  and the collection rate 
the increase in deposit service charge fees in is due to higher overdraft and nonsufficient funds nsf fees due to growth in deposit accounts attributable to recent acquisitions and absolutely free checking 
the increase in service charge revenues in was primarily attributable to growth in overdraft and nsf fees primarily associated with a revised fee structure implemented in mid asset management fees 
in  asset management fees increased  or  versus an increase of million  or  in at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting net growth of million  or over the increase reflects new business which produced growth in assets of million partially offset by normal distribution activity within managed accounts and estates 
at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or over this growth was due to the purchase of million in trust and investment management accounts from synovus trust company in connection with the quincy state bank acquisition  growth in new business  and improved asset returns 
mortgage banking revenues 
in  mortgage banking revenues increased  or  compared to a decrease of million  or in the increase in reflects a increase in production over which was driven by increased home purchase and construction activity in bank markets and lower interest rates for residential real estate financing 
the decrease in was due to a decline in fixed rate mortgage production that was affected by a general slow down in residential lending markets 
we generally sell all fixed rate residential loan production into the secondary market 
the level of interest rates  origination volume and percent of fixed rate production have significant impacts on our mortgage banking revenues 
merchant services fees 
merchant services fees increased million  or in compared to a  or increase in the improvement in both periods is directly related to growth in merchant card transaction volume primarily driven by growth in the client base 
noninterest income as a percent of average assets was in  compared to in  and in the decline from to primarily reflects the impact of the one time gain on sale of the bank s credit card portfolio in august the decline from versus reflects the impact of recent acquisitions which brought a lower and less diverse level of noninterest income in relation to the consolidated asset base 
noninterest expense noninterest expense grew by million  or  in and million  or in due to higher expense for compensation  occupancy  professional fees  advertising  and intangible amortization 
the table below reflects the major components of noninterest expense

our aggregate compensation expense in totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the increase in compensation was driven by higher expense for associate salaries  pension  and insurance benefits  primarily reflective of the integration of associates from acquisitions in late and mid in  compensation increased million  or  over the increase was due to higher expense for associate salaries  higher performance based compensation  increased pension costs  and insurance benefits 
the increase in associate salaries was partially due to two acquisitions 
occupancy 
occupancy expense including furniture  fixtures and equipment increased by million  or  in  compared to million  or in the increase in was driven by higher expense for depreciation  maintenance and repair  and property taxes  primarily attributable to the increase in the number of banking offices  and higher expense for core processing and other software maintenance agreements 
the increase in was primarily due to higher expense for utilities  property taxes  depreciation  and premises rental attributable to the increase in banking offices 
other 
other noninterest expense increased million  or  in  compared to million  or  in the increase in was attributable primarily to higher legal expense of  higher professional fees of  increased processing service cost of  higher advertising costs of million  increased printing and supply expense of  higher intangible amortization of million  increased interchange fees of  and higher miscellaneous expense of million 
legal fees increased due to corporate governance initiatives and a general increase in legal services tied to corporate activities 
higher external audit fees have driven the increase in professional fees 
the higher expense for processing fees is attributable to the cost of integrating recent acquisitions and core processing upgrades 
the increase in advertising expense reflects the marketing costs to support our absolutely free checking strategy 
the higher expense for printing and supplies is driven by recent acquisitions 
the increase in intangible amortization reflects core deposit amortization from recent acquisitions 
the increase in interchange fees is due to merchant card transaction volume and was offset by higher merchant service fees reflected in noninterest income 
the higher level of miscellaneous expense is due to increases in federal reserve account analysis fees  atm debit card production fees  associate hiring expense  training expense  and other real estate expense 
the increase in was attributable to higher professional fees of  reflective of the internal and external costs of sarbanes oxley section compliance and testing work  higher director fees of  due to an increase in the number of directors  higher fee structure  and number of meetings  higher advertising expense of  reflective of an increased level of marketing initiatives aimed at supporting two acquisitions and an increased level of product and market support activities  increased interchange service fees of  due to higher merchant card transaction volume  higher telephone expense of  increased intangible amortization expense of  and higher merger expenses of  the increases in telephone  intangible amortization  and merger expenses were due to the integration of two acquisitions during the year

income taxes the consolidated provision for federal and state income taxes was million in  compared to million in  and million in the increase in each of the three respective years was due to higher taxable income  driven by earnings growth and lower tax exempt income 
the effective tax rate was in  in  and in these rates differ from the combined federal and state statutory tax rates due primarily to tax exempt income on loans and securities

the growth reflects recent acquisitions and strong organic loan growth within existing markets 
although management is continually evaluating alternative sources of revenue  lending is a major component of our business and is key to profitability 
while management strives to identify opportunities to increase loans outstanding and enhance the portfolio s overall contribution to earnings  it can do so only by adhering to sound lending principles applied in a prudent and consistent manner 
thus  management will not relax its underwriting standards in order to achieve designated growth goals

allowance for loan losses management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for the estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
credit losses arise from the borrowers inability and unwillingness to repay  and from other risks inherent in the lending process including collateral risk  operations risk  concentration risk  and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s judgment of overall credit quality 
this is a significant estimate based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
the balance can and will change based on changes in the assessment of the portfolio s overall credit quality and other risk factors both internal and external to us 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed for adequacy of collateral  with a specific reserve assigned to those loans when necessary 
impaired loans are defined as those in which the full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms is improbable 
impaired loans generally include those that are past due for days or more and those classified as doubtful in accordance with our risk rating system 
loans classified as doubtful have a high possibility of loss  but because of certain factors that may work to strengthen the loan  its classification as a loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined 
not all loans are considered in the review for impairment  only loans that are for business purposes exceeding  are considered 
the evaluation is based on current financial condition of the borrower or current payment status of the loan 
the method used to assign a specific reserve depends on whether repayment of the loan is dependent on liquidation of collateral 
if repayment is dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the fair value of the collateral after estimated sales expenses 
if repayment is not dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the estimated cash flows discounted using the loan s effective interest rate 
the discounted value of the cash flows is based on the anticipated timing of the receipt of cash payments from the borrower 
the reserve allocations assigned to impaired loans are sensitive to the extent market conditions or the actual timing of cash receipts change 
once specific reserves have been assigned to impaired loans  general reserves are assigned to the remaining portfolio 
general reserves are assigned to commercial purpose loans of  or more that are not impaired and large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans  including commercial loans less than  consumer loans  and residential mortgage loans 
commercial purpose loans exceeding  that are not impaired  but exhibit specific weaknesses are detailed in a monthly problem loan report 
these loans are divided into seven different pools based on various risk characteristics and the underlying value of collateral taken to secure specific loans within the pools 
these classified loans are monitored for changes in risk ratings that are assigned based on the bank s asset classification policy  and for the ultimate disposition of the loan 
the ultimate disposition may include upgrades in risk ratings  payoff of the loan  or charge off of the loan 
this migration analysis results in a loan loss ratio by loan pool of classified loans that is applied to the balance of the pool to determine general reserves for specifically identified pools of problem loans 
this charge off ratio is adjusted for various environmental factors including past due and nonperforming trends in the loan portfolio  the micro and macro economic outlook  and credit administration practices as determined by independent parties 
general reserves are assigned to smaller balance homogenous loan pools  including commercial loans less than  consumer loans  and residential mortgage loans based on calculated overall loan loss ratios for the past three years 
the loan loss ratios applied are adjusted for various environmental factors  with further consideration given to the highest charge off experience of the bank dating back to the recession of the late s 
the allowance for loan losses is compared against the sum of the specific reserves assigned to impaired loans plus the general reserves assigned to the remaining portfolio 
adjustments are made when appropriate 
a most likely reserve value is determined within the computed range of required calculated reserve  with the actual allowance for loan losses compared to the most likely reserve value 
the unallocated reserve is monitored on a regular basis and adjusted based on qualitative risk factors both internal and external to us

while there can be no assurance that we will not sustain loan losses in a particular period that are substantial in relation to the size of the allowance  management s assessment of the loan portfolio does not indicate a likelihood of this occurrence 
it is management s opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end 
table provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan types for each of the past five years 
the reserve allocations  as calculated using the above methodology  are assigned to specific loan categories corresponding to the type represented within the components discussed 
there was a significant change in the reserve allocation in as noted by reserves held for the consumer loan  commercial real estate  and commercial portfolios 
the bank s credit card portfolio  which previously accounted for up to one third of net loan losses annually  was sold in august  thus reducing the reserves required to support consumer loans 
the large increase in for reserves held for commercial real estate and commercial loans was due to the acquisition of loans from fmb in late first national bank of alachua was acquired during  which pushed total reserves higher

potential problem loans and loan concentrations are discussed within the narrative portion of this section 
our nonperforming loans increased  or  from a level of million at december   to million at december  during loans totaling approximately million were added  while loans totaling million were removed from nonaccruing status 
of the million removed  million consisted of principal reductions and loan payoffs  million represented loans transferred to other real estate  million consisted of loans brought current and returned to an accrual status  and million was charged off 
where appropriate  management has allocated specific reserves to absorb anticipated losses 
all nonaccrual loans exceeding  not secured by family residential properties are reviewed quarterly for impairment 
a loan is considered impaired when the full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms is improbable 
when a loan is considered impaired  it is reviewed for exposure to credit loss 
if credit loss is probable  a specific reserve is allocated to absorb the anticipated loss

nonperforming assets capital allowance nonperforming loans for computation of this percentage  capital refers to shareowners equity plus the allowance for loan losses 
interest on nonaccrual loans is generally recognized only when received 
cash collected on nonaccrual loans is applied against the principal balance or recognized as interest income based upon management s expectations as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest in full 
if interest on nonaccruing loans had been recognized on a fully accruing basis  interest income recorded would have been  higher for the year ended december other real estate totaled  at december   versus  at december  this category includes property owned by the bank that was acquired either through foreclosure procedures or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
during  we added properties totaling million  and partially or completely liquidated properties totaling million  resulting in a net decrease in other real estate of approximately  potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms 
potential problem loans totaled million at december   compared to million at year end loans past due days or more totaled  at year end  down from  at the previous year end 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amount exceeds of total loans 
due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the bank and the relatively close proximity of the markets  we have both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded 
specifically  due to the nature of our markets  a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been secured with real estate 
while we have a majority of our loans secured by real estate  the primary types of real estate collateral are commercial properties and family residential properties 
at december   commercial real estate mortgage loans and residential real estate mortgage loans accounted for and  respectively  of the loan portfolio 
the real estate portfolio  while subject to cyclical pressures  is not typically speculative in nature and is originated at amounts that are within or below regulatory guidelines for collateral values 
management anticipates no significant reduction in the percentage of real estate loans to total loans outstanding 
management is continually analyzing its loan portfolio in an effort to identify and resolve problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
as of december   management believes it has identified and adequately reserved for such problem assets 
however  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its markets  creating financial difficulties for certain borrowers 
as such  management continues to focus its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential losses as they arise 
investment securities in  our average investment portfolio increased million  or  from and decreased million  or  from to as a percentage of average earning assets  the investment portfolio represented in  compared to in in  the increase in the portfolio was due to additional securities obtained through an acquisition in late  and the increase in required holdings of federal home loan bank stock 
in  the decline in the portfolio was attributable to the maturities of investment securities  which in anticipation of future loan growth  were only partially replaced during the period 
throughout  we will closely monitor liquidity levels to assess the need to purchase additional investments 
in  average taxable investments increased million  or  while tax exempt investments decreased million  or 
management will continue to purchase bank qualified municipal issues when it considers the yield to be attractive and we can do so without adversely impacting our tax position 
as of december   we may purchase additional tax exempt securities without adverse tax consequences 
the investment portfolio is a significant component of our operations and  as such  it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset liability management 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
classifying securities as available for sale offers management full flexibility in managing our liquidity and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels 
securities in the available for sale portfolio are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareowners equity 
at december   shareowners equity included a net unrealized loss of million  compared to an unrealized loss of million at december  it is neither management s intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore we do not maintain a trading portfolio

deposits and funds purchased average total deposits of billion in increased million  or  from the prior year 
deposit growth for the year was driven primarily by the integration of deposits from bank acquisitions and the introduction of absolutely free checking 
all deposit categories grew  with a majority of the growth being realized in non maturity interest bearing deposits 
average noninterest bearing deposits as a percent of average total deposits declined from in to in this was primarily a result of absolutely free checking  promotions on interest bearing deposit products  and an increase in the level of interest rates 
we experienced deposit run off in acquisition markets throughout  primarily in certificates of deposit 
competition for deposits remains strong in all bank markets 
in  growth is anticipated to continue in nonmaturity deposits and be partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposits  but at a slower pace than table provides an analysis of our average deposits  by category  and average rates paid thereon for each of the last three years

management monitors our financial position in an effort to ensure we have ready access to sufficient liquid funds to meet normal transaction requirements  can take advantage of investment opportunities and cover unforeseen liquidity demands 
in addition to core deposit growth  sources of funds available to meet liquidity demands include cash received through ordinary business activities eg  collection of interest and fees  federal funds sold  loan and investment maturities  our bank lines of credit  approved lines for the purchase of federal funds by ccb and federal home loan bank advances 
we ended with approximately million in liquidity  a decline of approximately million from the previous year end 
on a year to date average basis  liquidity declined million from the decline was primarily the result of loan growth 
management expects liquidity to continue to decline throughout due to the funding of planned loan growth 
we have the ability to draw on a million revolving credit note  due on october  interest is payable quarterly at libor plus an applicable margin on advances 
the revolving credit is unsecured 
the existing loan agreement contains certain financial covenants that we must maintain 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the terms of the agreement and had million available under the line of credit facility 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding to the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb consisting of notes 
three notes totaling million are classified as short term borrowings with the remaining notes classified as long term borrowings 
the interest rates are fixed and the weighted average rate at december  was

this note matures on june  the proceeds of this borrowing were used to partially fund the first alachua banking corporation acquisition 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures will approximate million over the next twelve months 
these capital expenditures are expected to consist primarily of several new offices in existing markets  office equipment and furniture  and technology purchases 
management believes these capital expenditures can be funded internally without impairing our ability to meet our on going obligations 
capital we continue to maintain a strong capital position 
the ratio of shareowners equity to total assets at year end was   and  in   and  respectively 
we are subject to risk based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weighted assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board require bank holding companies to have a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  with at least half of the total capital in the form of tier capital 
as of december   we exceeded these capital guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  compared to and  respectively  in as allowed by federal reserve board capital guidelines the trust preferred securities issued by ccbg capital trust i and ccbg capital trust ii are included as tier capital in our capital calculations previously noted 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our two trust preferred security offerings 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to our capital adequacy 
a tangible leverage ratio is also used in connection with the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets 
the minimum leverage ratio under this standard is for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs 
an additional to may be required for other companies  depending upon their regulatory ratings and expansion plans 
on december   we had a leverage ratio of compared to in shareowners equity as of december  for each of the last three years is presented below shareowners equity dollars in thousands common stock additional paid in capital    retained earnings    subtotal    accumulated other comprehensive loss income  net of tax   total shareowners equity    at december   our common stock had a book value of per diluted share compared to in beginning in  book value has been impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available for sale 
at december   the net unrealized loss was million compared to a net unrealized loss of 
million in the increase in unrealized loss is primarily due to the general increase in interest rates 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
the purchases are made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
to date  we have repurchased a total of  shares at an average purchase price of per share 
we offer an associate incentive plan under which certain associates are eligible to earn shares of our common stock based upon achieving established performance goals 
in  we issued  shares  valued at approximately  under this plan 
we also offer stock purchase plans  whereby employees and directors may purchase shares at a discount 
in   shares  valued at approximately  before discount  were issued under these plans 
dividends adequate capital and financial strength is paramount to our stability and the stability of our subsidiary bank 
cash dividends declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on our capital levels 
when determining the level of dividends the following factors are considered compliance with state and federal laws and regulations  our capital position and our ability to meet our financial obligations  projected earnings and asset levels  and the ability of the bank and us to fund dividends 
although a consistent dividend payment is believed to be favorably viewed by the financial markets and shareowners  the board of directors will declare dividends only if we are considered to have adequate capital 
future capital requirements and corporate plans are considered when the board considers a dividend payment 
dividends declared and paid totaled

total cash dividends declared per share in represented a increase over all share and per share data has been adjusted to reflect the five for four stock split effective july  off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
however  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our clients 
at december   we had million in commitments to extend credit and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party 
we use the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact its ability to meet on going obligations 
in the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels  management believes current liquidity  available lines of credit from the fhlb  investment security maturities and our revolving credit facility provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments 
accounting policies critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make various estimates and assumptions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is evaluated quarterly by us for adequacy 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different required allowance  and thereby a larger or smaller provision recognized as expense in any given reporting period 
a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses can be found in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  core deposit assets  and other identifiable intangibles that were recognized in connection with various acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
we perform an impairment review on an annual basis to determine if there has been impairment of our goodwill 
we have determined that no impairment existed at december  impairment testing requires management to make significant judgments and estimates relating to the fair value of its identified reporting units 
significant changes to these estimates may have a material impact on our reported results 
core deposit assets represent the premium we paid for core deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on the straight line method over various periods ranging from years 
generally  core deposits refer to nonpublic  non maturing deposits including noninterest bearing deposits  now  money market and savings 
we make certain estimates relating to the useful life of these assets  and rate of run off based on the nature of the specific assets and the client bases acquired 
if there is a reason to believe there has been a permanent loss in value  management will assess these assets for impairment 
any changes in the original estimates may materially affect reported earnings 
pension assumptions 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all of our associates 
our funding policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set by law 
pension expense  reflected in the consolidated statements of income in noninterest expense as salaries and associate benefits  is determined by an external actuarial valuation based on assumptions that are evaluated annually as of december  the measurement date for the pension obligation 
the consolidated statements of financial condition reflect an accrued pension benefit cost due to funding levels and unrecognized actuarial amounts 
the most significant assumptions used in calculating the pension obligation are the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation  the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the assumed rate of annual compensation increases 
these assumptions are re evaluated annually with the external actuaries  taking into consideration both current market conditions and anticipated long term market conditions 
the weighted average discount rate is determined by matching anticipated retirement plan cash flows for a year period to long term corporate aa rated bonds and solving for the underlying rate of return  which investing in such securities would generate 
this methodology is applied consistently from year to year 
the discount rate utilized in was 
the estimated impact to pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have been a decrease of approximately  and an increase of approximately  respectively 
we anticipate using a discount rate in the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the current and anticipated future mix of assets in the plan 
the assets currently consist of equity securities  us government and government agency debt securities  and other securities typically temporary liquid funds awaiting investment 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets utilized for was 
the estimated impact to pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease in the rate of return would have been an approximate  decrease or increase  respectively 
we anticipate using a rate of return on plan assets for of 
the assumed rate of annual compensation increases of in is based on expected trends in salaries and the employee base 
this assumption is not expected to change materially in detailed information on the pension plan  the actuarially determined disclosures  and the assumptions used are provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to a newly adopted accounting principle 
previously  most changes in accounting principle were recognized by including the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
under sfas  retrospective application requires i the cumulative effect of the change to the new accounting principle on periods prior to those presented to be reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the first period presented  ii an offsetting adjustment  if any  to be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity for that period  and iii financial statements for each individual prior period presented to be adjusted to reflect the direct period specific effects of applying the new accounting principle 
special retroactive application rules apply in situations where it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle are required to be reported in the period in which the accounting change is made 
sfas carries forward the guidance in apb opinion accounting changes  requiring justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability 
sfas also carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb opinion  for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and for a change in accounting estimate 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect sfas will significantly impact our financial statements upon its adoption on january  fasb staff position fsp no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss should be recognized equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
fsp nullifies certain provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  while retaining the disclosure requirements of eitf which were adopted in fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect fsp will significantly impact our financial statements upon its adoption on january  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment revised 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity i exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  or ii incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
we adopted the accounting standards set forth in sfas no 
in and have accordingly expensed stock based compensation for   and see note accounting policies 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans acquired in a transfer when those cash flow differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
as such  sop applies to loans and debt securities acquired individually  in pools or as part of a business combination and does not apply to originated loans 
the application of sop limits the interest income  including accretion of purchase price discounts that may be recognized for certain loans and debt securities 
additionally  sop does not allow the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected to be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance  such as the allowance for loan losses 
sop requires that increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the initial investment be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loan or debt security over its remaining life 
decreases in expected cash flows should be recognized as impairment 
in the case of loans acquired in a business combination where the loans show signs of credit deterioration  sop represents a significant change from current purchase accounting practice whereby the acquiree s allowance for loan losses is typically added to the acquirer s allowance for loan losses 
sop is effective for loans and debt securities acquired by us beginning january  we adopted sop and application of its guidance for the recent first alachua bank corporation acquisition  which did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
loans acquired in future acquisitions will continue to be accounted for under sop item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk overview market risk management arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
we have risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk and do not participate in activities that give rise to significant market risk involving exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management the normal course of business activity exposes us to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
we seek to avoid fluctuations in our net interest margin and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
accordingly  our interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by our asset and liability committee alco  which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effects on net interest income and capital 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
alco continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
alco s objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
in order to meet this objective  management may adjust the rates charged paid on loans deposits or may shorten lengthen the duration of assets or liabilities within the parameters set by alco 
our financial assets and liabilities are classified as other than trading 
an analysis of the other than trading financial components  including the fair values  are presented in table this table presents our consolidated interest rate sensitivity position as of year end based upon certain assumptions as set forth in the notes to the table 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity analysis is to measure the impact on our net interest income due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the asset and liability values presented in table may not necessarily be indicative of our interest rate sensitivity over an extended period of time 
we expect rising rates to have a favorable impact on the net interest margin  subject to the magnitude and timeframe over which the rate changes occur 
however  as general interest rates rise or fall  other factors such as current market conditions and competition may impact how we respond to changing rates and thus impact the magnitude of change in net interest income 
non maturity deposits offer management greater discretion as to the direction  timing  and magnitude of interest rate changes and can have a material impact on our interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the relative level of interest rates as compared to the current yields rates of existing assets liabilities can impact both the direction and magnitude of the change in net interest margin as rates rise and fall from one period to the next 
inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of our ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled results of operations
