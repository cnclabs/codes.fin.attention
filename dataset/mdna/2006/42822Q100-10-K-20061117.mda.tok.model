item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if an impairment charge is required in the future  the charge would negatively impact reported earnings in the period of the charge 

table of contents our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government regulations or if government regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs 
the areas in which we provide outsourcing and consulting services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving 
changes in government regulations in the united states  our principal geographic market  affecting the value  use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs  including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare such as medical plans  defined contribution such as k plans  defined benefit such as pension plans or payroll delivery  may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 
in addition  our growth strategy includes a number of global expansion objectives which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the united states 
if we are unable to adapt our services to applicable laws and regulations  our ability to grow our business or to provide effective outsourcing and consulting services in these areas will be negatively impacted 
recently  we have seen regulatory initiatives in both the united states and certain european countries result in companies either discontinuing their defined benefit programs or de emphasizing the importance such programs play in the overall mix of their benefit programs with a trend toward increased use of defined contribution plans 
if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate  our results of operation of our business could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting  our business could suffer 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  both our reputation in the marketplace and our financial results could suffer 
we have spent considerable resources reviewing and implementing improvements to our internal controls 
although we have received an unqualified audit opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting  we cannot be certain that our efforts will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inadequate internal controls could also cause our clients or our investors to lose confidence in our services delivery or reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our business performance and growth plans will be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technology based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry standards and client preferences 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost effective basis  and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace 
additionally  the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses 
if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost effective technologies  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 
our business is also dependent  in part  upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their employees and our ability to deliver the efficiencies and convenience afforded by technology 
if growth in the use of technology does not continue  demand for our services may decrease 
use of new technology for commerce generally requires understanding and acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional means of conducting commerce and exchanging information may be particularly reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that would not utilize their existing personnel and infrastructure 

table of contents if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services  we may face damage to our professional reputation or legal liability 
we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality outsourcing and consulting services 
as a result  if a client is not satisfied with our services  it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses 
moreover  if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 
the nature of our work  especially our actuarial services  involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events  the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance 
in addition  we could make computational  software programming or data management errors 
further  a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice 
defending lawsuits arising out of any of our services could require substantial amounts of management attention  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
our exposure to liability on a particular engagement may be greater than the profit opportunity of the engagement 
in addition to client liability  governmental authorities may impose penalties with respect to our errors or omissions and may preclude us from doing business in relevant jurisdictions 
in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums  claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business 
improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation 
in addition  one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and plan participants 
we have established several policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information 
although we continue to review and improve our policies and procedures  it is possible that our security controls over personal data  our training of employees and vendors on data security  and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information 
such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data  resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 
further  data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations  which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services 
our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 
we depend on our employees  the inability to attract new talent or the loss of key employees could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and adversely affect our business 
our success and ability to grow are dependent  in part  on our ability to hire and retain large numbers of talented people 
in particular  our employees personal relationships with our clients are an important element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet demand or losing employees who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in connection with our initial public offering and our transition to a corporate structure  we granted employees  including those employees who were owners of hewitt holdings llc  the limited liability company that was the parent entity of hewitt associates llc at the time of our initial public offering  shares of restricted stock or stock options to attract  retain and motivate such employees 
since our initial public offering  we have also made  and anticipate making in the future  other equity based awards to many of our employees to serve in part as an incentive to remain employed with the company 
the incentives provided by these awards may not be effective in causing these employees to stay with our organization 
all of the restricted stock granted at the time of our initial public offering as well as those shares issued in connection with our acquisitions of bacon woodrow in june and exult in october vested on or before june and transfer restrictions on those shares have lapsed  other than for certain minimum stock holding requirements imposed on all executives 
since these shares have vested and become freely transferable  we may not be successful at retaining the persons holding these shares  many of whom continue to be important to our success 

table of contents our global operations and expansion strategy pose complex management  foreign currency  legal  tax and economic risks  which we may not adequately address 
as of september   we had a total of offices in countries and additional offices in additional countries through joint ventures and minority investments 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenues were attributable to activities in the united states and approximately of our revenues were attributable to our activities in europe  canada  the asia pacific region and latin america 
our ability to provide services from global locations having lower cost structures than the united states and continued penetration of markets beyond the united states are important components of the company s growth strategy 
a number of risks may inhibit our international operations and global sourcing efforts  preventing us from realizing our global expansion objectives  including insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions  which may be due to applicable laws and regulations or benefit practices in such jurisdictions  ability to execute effective and efficient cross border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  including but not limited to regulations regarding the flow and transfer of data and other information between countries  multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws  restrictions on the movement of cash  political instability and international terrorism  currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  restrictions on the import and export of technologies  price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies  and trade barriers 
the demand for our services may not grow at rates we anticipate 
we have made and continue to make a significant investment and devote significant attention to our human resources business process outsourcing services offering 
our human resources business process outsourcing services offering may not be well received by our clients  or the demand for human resources business process outsourcing may not grow as rapidly as we anticipate  which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins 
in addition  the growth for stand alone benefits outsourcing services has slowed  particularly in the large plan market over  participants  as some larger companies that have not previously outsourced some of their benefit programs consider whether they wish to outsource a larger portion of their human resources function or continue to administer such programs themselves 
if a greater percentage of such organizations determine not to outsource such programs than we anticipate  it could also have an adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins 
if we fail to establish and maintain alliances for developing  marketing and delivering our services  our ability to increase our revenues and profitability may suffer 
our growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain alliances with businesses such as brokerage firms  financial services companies  health care organizations  insurance companies  other business process outsourcing organizations and other companies in order to develop  market and deliver our services 
if our strategic alliances are discontinued or we have difficulty developing new alliances  our ability to increase or maintain our client base may be substantially diminished 
we rely on third parties to provide services and their failure to perform the service could do harm to our business 
as part of providing services to clients  we rely on a number of third party service providers 
these providers include  but are not limited to  plan trustees and payroll service providers responsible for transferring funds to employees or on behalf of employees  and providers of data and information  such as software vendors  health plan 
table of contents providers  investment managers and investment advisers  that we work with to provide information to clients employees 
it also includes providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers employed by us in connection with our human resources business processing services delivered to our clients 
failure of third party service providers to perform in a timely manner could result in contractual or regulatory penalties  liability claims from clients and or employees  damage to our reputation and harm to our business 
we have only a limited ability to protect the intellectual property rights that are important to our success  and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property 
existing laws of some countries in which we provide or intend to provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality policies  non disclosure and other contractual arrangements and copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
the steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property  and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
protecting our intellectual property rights may also consume significant management time and resources 
we cannot be sure that our services and products  or the products of others that we offer to our clients  do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties  and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients 
these claims may harm our reputation  result in financial liabilities and prevent us from offering some services or products 
we have generally agreed in our outsourcing contracts to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in some instances  the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client 
any claims or litigation in this area  whether we ultimately win or lose  could be time consuming and costly  injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we may not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms 
any limitation on our ability to provide a service or product could cause us to lose revenue generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 
we rely heavily on our computing and communications infrastructure and the integrity of these systems in the delivery of services for our clients  and our operational performance and revenue growth depends  in part  on the reliability and functionality of this infrastructure as a means of delivering human resources services 
the internet is a key mechanism for delivering our services to our clients efficiently and cost effectively 
our clients may not be receptive to human resource services delivered over the internet due to concerns regarding transaction security  user privacy  the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons 
our clients concerns may be heightened by the fact we use the internet to transmit extremely confidential information about our clients and their employees  such as compensation  medical information and other personally identifiable information 
in addition  the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and volume of traffic 
as a result  its performance and reliability may decline 
in order to maintain the level of security  service and reliability that our clients require  we may be required to make significant investments in our on line means of delivering human resources services 
in addition  websites and proprietary on line services have experienced service interruptions and other delays occurring throughout their infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  internet usage as a medium of exchange of information could grow more slowly or decline and the internet might not adequately support our web based tools 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations with respect to the internet may impede the efficiency of the internet as a medium of exchange of information and decrease the demand for our services 
if we cannot use the internet effectively to deliver our services  our revenue growth and results of operation may be impaired 
we may lose client data as a result of major catastrophes and other similar problems that may materially adversely impact our operations 
we have multiple processing centers around the globe which use various commercial methods for disaster recovery capabilities 
our main data processing center  located in lincolnshire  illinois is in a dual separate data center configuration to provide back up capabilities 
in the event of a disaster  we have developed business continuity plans  however  they may not be sufficient  and the data recovered may not be sufficient for the administration of our clients human resources programs and processes 

table of contents our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter  which may result in volatility of our stock price 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this may lead to volatility in our stock price 
the factors that are likely to cause these variations are the rate at which we obtain new outsourcing engagements since our outsourcing engagements often require substantial implementation costs that are recovered over the term of the engagements  seasonality of certain services  including annual benefit enrollment processes  timing of consulting projects and their termination  timing of commencement of new outsourcing engagements  changes in estimates of profitability of outsourcing engagements  the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  pricing pressure on new client services and renewals  the timing  success and costs of sales  marketing and product development programs  the success of strategic acquisitions  alliances or investments  changes in estimates  accruals and payments of variable compensation to our employees  and general economic factors 
in addition  our operating results in future periods may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which may materially adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
there are significant limitations on the ability of any person or company to buy hewitt without the approval of the board of directors  which may decrease the price of our class a common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of hewitt more difficult without the approval of our board of directors  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes  each of which serves for a staggered three year term  a director may be removed by our stockholders only for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors  only the board of directors or the chairman of the board may call special meetings of our stockholders  our stockholders may take action only at a meeting of the stockholders and not by written consent  our stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to place stockholders proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of the stockholders  the board of directors may consider the impact of any proposed change of control transaction on constituencies other than the stockholders in determining what is in the best interest of hewitt  business combinations involving one or more persons that own or intend to own at least of the voting stock must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least of the voting stock  unless the consideration paid in the business combination is generally the highest price paid by these persons to acquire the voting stock or a majority of the directors unaffiliated with these persons who were directors prior to the time these persons acquired their shares approve the transaction  and the stockholders may amend or repeal the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the by laws regarding change of control transactions and business combinations only by a vote of holders of two thirds of the outstanding common stock at that time 

table of contents section of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interest 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits certain business combinations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation s voting stock for a three year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder

certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
overview in fiscal  the company focused on achieving more profitable growth and stabilizing the hr bpo business while continuing to provide high quality service to existing and new clients 
during the year  overall operating results were favorably impacted by direct net revenue growth excluding third party supplier revenue of 
we experienced marketplace improvement during the year for both benefits outsourcing and consulting 
benefits outsourcing saw strong demand from both new and existing clients as well as one time project work 
while it is still early to predict continued strength in the overall demand for standalone benefits outsourcing services  we are encouraged by the renewed interest this fiscal year 
consulting revenue growth was driven by higher demand for talent and organization consulting as well as the communication service areas 
market demand for consulting based services was strong across all regions 
although we saw solid performance in consulting and benefits outsourcing  we faced a number of challenges in our hr bpo business 
in the current year  we recorded non cash charges of million related to the hr bpo business which consisted of the following million impairment of goodwill reflecting the lower expected profitability of several existing contracts as well as the company s revised expectations surrounding new clients  million aggregate loss provision for certain existing contracts due to higher than expected costs to be incurred over the life of the contract 
the expected higher costs resulted from challenges in the early phases of adding new services for these contracts resulting in higher than expected implementation and future ongoing costs  million impairment related to the termination of a client contract  and million impairment of long lived assets primarily related to lower expected utilization of an acquired asset 
these non cash charges directly impacted the current fiscal year financial results 
a majority of these costs were recorded in the third quarter when management deemed it necessary to revise expected revenues and costs associated with both its existing and future contracts as the hr bpo business was experiencing higher implementation and operating costs than anticipated on a number of its multi service contracts 
in addition  the company revised its 
table of contents expectations surrounding the number of new clients and their relative size to allow time to stabilize existing client contracts and strategize on future contracts 
we continue to closely monitor the progress of each of our existing hr bpo contracts 
this year s results also reflect increases in compensation and related expenses driven by both higher levels of performance and stock based compensation as well as an increase in headcount and contractor spend within the outsourcing segment as we addressed implementation and ongoing support issues with certain clients 
additionally  we adopted sfas r  share based payment  in the current year which resulted in our expensing of stock options 
operationally  during the year  we completed our internal reorganization focused on improving the way our business units work together  share knowledge and leverage resources 
within both of our business segments  we created global leadership groups better positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in the global marketplace 
we also completed a number of strategic and operational organization changes which impacted the way we historically reported our segment results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on segments and geographic data 
we reduced our us associate workforce in selected areas and redeployed associates to other roles within the outsourcing segment to better align our resources to improve our execution on existing clients and to support new client growth 
during  the company experienced senior leadership changes including the appointment of russell p 
fradin as chairman and chief executive officer  the appointment of john j 
park as the company s chief financial officer and the resignation of bryan j 
doyle  the company s president of outsourcing and a member of the company s board of directors 
the company internally filled the outsourcing position with an acting president 
for further discussion of how these items impacted our results across the company  please see our discussion of consolidated and segment results below 

table of contents consolidated results the following table sets forth our historical results of operations 
year ended september  change of net revenues in thousands revenues revenues before reimbursements net revenues reimbursements total revenues operating expenses compensation and related expenses  excluding initial public offering restricted stock awards goodwill and asset impairment initial public offering restricted stock awards reimbursable expenses other operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating loss income other income expense  net loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income net revenues include  and  of third party supplier revenues for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the third party supplier arrangements are generally marginally profitable 
the related third party supplier expenses are included in other operating expenses 
net revenues the decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a significant decline in third party supplier revenues resulting from the termination of an outsourcing client contract in the prior year 
excluding third party supplier revenue  direct revenue grew 
this increase is primarily due to consulting growth in both the talent and organization consulting services in north america as well as the asia pacific regions and benefits consulting particularly in europe 
outsourcing direct revenues improved as a result of increased services to existing clients as well as increased one time project work in benefits outsourcing 
net revenues  excluding third party supplier revenues and after adjusting for foreign currency translation losses of approximately million and the net effects of acquisitions and dispositions of approximately million  increased as compared to the prior year period 
compensation and related expenses the increase over prior year primarily relates to million of higher performance based compensation than in the prior year  million of higher wages due to headcount and cost of living increases  million incremental stock based compensation expense  including expense related to the fiscal grants of restricted stock and the expensing of stock options under sfas r  as well as million of expense related to anticipated losses on certain hr bpo contracts 
these increases were partially offset by higher levels of deferred contract costs related to the outsourcing segment in the current year 

table of contents goodwill and asset impairment during the year the company recognized million of impairment charges related to the hr bpo business within the outsourcing segment 
the non cash charges consisted of million of goodwill impairment  million of asset impairment for certain existing contracts due to higher than expected costs to be incurred over the life of the contract  million of asset impairment resulting from the termination of a client contract and million of long lived asset impairment primarily due to lower than expected utilization of an acquired asset 
initial public offering restricted stock awards in connection with our initial public offering on june   we granted approximately million shares of class a restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees 
compensation and related payroll tax expenses of approximately million were recorded as initial public offering restricted stock award expense from june  through september  the grants fully vested on june  other operating expenses the decrease in other operating expenses is primarily driven by a significant decrease in the third party supplier costs due to a terminated client contract in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were consistent period over period 
other income expense  net this year  we recognized a gain of million in connection with a contribution of our german retirement and financial management business in exchange for an increased investment in a german actuarial business 
this gain as well as higher interest income  due to increased operating cash flows  accounted for the majority of the year over year increase 
income tax provision our consolidated effective income tax rate was for the year ended september   as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
we identify items which are not normal and recurring in nature and treat these as discrete events 
the tax effect of discrete items is booked entirely in the quarter in which the discrete event occurs 
additionally  tax legislation and tax examinations in the jurisdictions in which we do business may change our effective tax rate in future periods 
while such changes cannot be predicted  if they occur  the impact on our tax assets  obligations and liquidity will need to be measured and recognized in the financial statements 
in fiscal a number of significant items including a non deductible goodwill impairment charge  the net impact of reserve activity as well as a reduction of deferred tax assets related to certain foreign entities impacted the current year rate 
in addition  we provided million of additional deferred tax assets associated with acquisitions 
this deferred tax asset was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 

table of contents fiscal years ended september  and as a result of the merger with exult on october   the results of operations for the years ended september  and are not comparable 
in order to provide a more meaningful discussion of our results  the following table presents the audited historical results of hewitt for the year ended september  and as well as the unaudited pro forma results for the year ended september   as if the merger and consolidation had occurred on october  the unaudited pro forma combined income statement is presented for comparison purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that might have occurred had the merger actually taken place as of the dates specified  or that may be expected to occur in the future 
additionally  the unaudited combined pro forma income statement does not assume any benefits from cost savings or synergies and does not reflect any integration costs that the combined company realized or incurred after the merger 
the discussion that follows is based upon comparing fiscal results with pro forma results

the third party supplier arrangements are generally marginally profitable 
the related third party supplier expenses are included in other operating expenses 

table of contents net revenues the revenue growth was primarily related to increased services to new and existing clients in our hr bpo business  an increase of million in hr bpo related third party supplier revenues  and  to a lesser extent  increases in revenue from our benefits outsourcing business as well as growth in our consulting segment 
retirement and financial management services grew in all regions  particularly in europe and north america  and talent and organization consulting services grew year over year  primarily outside of north america 
adjusting for the net favorable effects of foreign currency translation of approximately million and the favorable effects of the prior year acquisitions of approximately million  net revenues grew over the pro forma prior year period 
compensation and related expenses the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased headcount within the outsourcing segment to support the growth in the hr bpo business being partially offset by lower levels of performance based compensation and lower discretionary benefit plan expense 
goodwill and asset impairment during fiscal the company recorded a customer relationship intangible impairment charge of approximately million related to two terminated client contracts 
initial public offering restricted stock awards in connection with our initial public offering on june   we granted approximately million shares of class a restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees 
compensation and related payroll tax expenses of approximately million were recorded as initial public offering restricted stock award expense from june   through september   of which million was recorded each year for the year ended september  and the comparable prior year 
other operating expenses the million year over year increase in other operating expenses primarily reflects a higher mix of hr bpo services provided through contracted third party vendors and increased client service delivery expenses in hr bpo and benefits outsourcing 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were consistent period over period 
other expense  net other expense  net decreased as a result of increased interest income on short term investments and other accrued interest income in being partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to a higher level of debt primarily in connection with the exult merger and a term loan credit facility in the uk to finance the build out of the local office 
provision for income taxes the increase in the provision for income taxes is due to higher income before income taxes in the current year partially offset by a decrease in the expected effective tax rate from to 
the decrease in the effective tax rate primarily relates to an increase in reported earnings of our international subsidiaries and a reduction in state income tax rates due to shifts in the locations where we provide services 

table of contents segment results we provide services through two business segments outsourcing and consulting 
the following table sets forth unaudited historical segment results for the periods presented 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed an internal reorganization designed to streamline operations and create greater accountability throughout the company 
although the reorganization did not change the company s reportable segments  it did have an impact on the revenues and costs reported within each segment as well as the level of unallocated shared service costs 
the company also began to record intersegment revenues for work performed by one segment on behalf of another 
the company has recast the fiscal results for comparative purposes

the third party supplier arrangements are generally marginally profitable 
the related third party supplier expenses are included in other operating expenses 
outsourcing the decrease in net revenues as compared to the year ended september  was primarily due to a significant decrease in third party supplier revenues resulting from the loss of a hr bpo client in the prior year 
excluding third party supplier revenues and the effects of acquisitions of approximately million  outsourcing net revenues increased 
foreign currency translation had minimal impact on the year 
increases in hr bpo client services and benefits outsourcing revenues as well as one time project revenue throughout the year were partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to the termination of a client contract in the prior year 
outsourcing segment results as a percentage of outsourcing net revenues decreased  primarily as a result of the non cash charges related to the hr bpo business of million for goodwill impairment  million for anticipated losses on certain hr bpo contracts  million net asset impairment as the result of the termination of a client contract 
table of contents in the first quarter and million for impairment of long lived assets 
the current year also included million of higher performance based compensation  million of stock based compensation related to the fiscal grants of restricted stock awards and the expensing of stock options under sfas r as well as million of severance expense 
these charges were partially offset by a number of items which increased profitability this year including efficiencies driven by global sourcing  profitable one time project work  cost savings from a significant reduction in marginally profitable third party supplier revenue and related expenses and previous restructuring activities 
in addition  the year over year comparison was favorably impacted by a million customer relationship intangible asset impairment charge recorded in the prior year 
consulting consulting net revenues increased by during the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
adjusting for foreign currency translation losses of approximately million and the net effects of acquisitions and dispositions of approximately million  consulting net revenues increased 
the majority of the increase was driven by increased demand for benefits consulting due to higher actuarial consulting and pension administration services as well as talent and organization consulting services  particularly compensation consulting  corporate restructuring and change services 
communication consulting services also has grown due to increased support for the implementation and ongoing management of outsourcing programs  as well as increased client demand for communications support of their employee benefit plans 
consulting segment income as a percentage of consulting net revenues decreased due to higher compensation resulting primarily from million of higher performance based compensation in the current year as well as million incremental stock based compensation this year related to the fiscal grants of restricted stock awards and the expensing of stock options under sfas r 
these items were partially offset by higher revenues in fiscal fiscal years ended september  and exult s operating results are included within the outsourcing segment 
the pro forma fiscal results reflect an allocation of exult cost center expenses which is consistent with the allocation methodology applied to our similar shared service costs 
the costs of information services  human resources and direct client delivery activities provided by hewitt s client development function were allocated to the outsourcing and consulting segments on a specific identification basis or based on usage and combined pro forma headcount 
the addition of exult personnel in outsourcing resulted in a shift in allocated costs from the consulting segment to the outsourcing segment which is consistent with the allocation methodologies used by hewitt for all periods presented 
the following table presents our segment results for the year ended september   compared with our unaudited pro forma segment results for the year ended september  and our segment results for the year ended september  additionally  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed an internal reorganization designed to streamline operations and create greater accountability throughout the company 
although the reorganization did not change the company s reportable segments  it did have an impact to the revenues and costs reported within each segment as well as the level of unallocated shared service costs 
the company also began to record intersegment revenues for work performed by one segment on behalf of another 
the company has recast the fiscal results for comparative purposes however  fiscal and pro forma fiscal results have not been recast as it was not practical 
as a result  the fiscal and pro forma fiscal segment results do not include the movement of certain unallocated shared service costs into segment results nor the recording of intersegment revenues and are not comparable to fiscal

outsourcing fiscal segment revenues before reimbursements include approximately million of recast adjustments mainly related to the realignment of certain business units and the recording of intersegment revenue 
considering the recast adjustments of million  outsourcing segment revenues before reimbursements increased by  to  million for the year ended september   from  million in the pro forma prior year 
the revenue growth was due  in part  to the addition of revenues from the acquisitions as well as the effects of foreign currency translation 
excluding the favorable effects of the acquisitions of approximately million and the net favorable effects of foreign currency translation of approximately million  outsourcing net revenues increased 
this increase was primarily due to increased services to new and existing clients in our hr bpo business  which included an increase in subcontracted third party supplier revenues of million  and  to a lesser extent  increases in revenue from our stand alone benefits outsourcing business 
growth in the stand alone benefits outsourcing business primarily related to a change in service mix toward higher revenue generating administrative services  and was partially offset by the planned re pricing of some older contracts to current market prices 

table of contents fiscal segment income includes approximately million of recast adjustments mainly related to the realignment of the sales group  shared service practice and certain business units to the segment as well as recording intersegment expense 
considering the recast adjustments  outsourcing segment income decreased  to million in the year ended september   from million in the pro forma prior year and segment income as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  from in the pro forma prior year period 
included in the fiscal results was a million customer relationship intangible asset impairment charge related to two outsourcing contracts and exult retention related awards expense of million offset in part by the addition of the acquisitions which contributed million of operating income in fiscal segment income also benefited from lower performance based compensation and discretionary benefit plan expenses for outsourcing personnel of million and million  respectively  than in the pro forma prior year period 
after excluding the effect of these items  outsourcing margins decreased due to higher losses on early stage hr bpo contracts  a higher mix of third party supplier revenues  a higher than anticipated level of expense including the build out of our global delivery capabilities  and lower benefits outsourcing margins 
benefits margins were down modestly primarily due to re pricing of some older contracts to market prices and to a lesser extent by higher client service delivery costs in the year 
consulting fiscal segment revenues before reimbursements include approximately million of recast adjustments mainly related to the realignment of certain business units and the recording of intersegment revenue 
considering the recast adjustments  consulting net revenues increased by  to million in the year ended september   from million in the pro forma prior year 
a portion of this growth was due to the net favorable effect of foreign currency translation of approximately million and the favorable effect of the acquisitions of a majority interest in our puerto rico operations and a pension management business in the netherlands of approximately million 
adjusting for the effects of foreign currency and the acquisitions  consulting net revenues increased by in  as compared to the pro forma prior year 
for the year ended september   the increase was primarily due to growth in retirement and financial management  primarily in europe and north america  and talent and organization consulting services primarily outside north america 
fiscal segment income includes approximately million of recast adjustments mainly related to the realignment of the sales group  shared service practice and certain business units to the segment as well as recording intersegment expense 
considering the recast adjustments  consulting segment income increased by  to million in the year ended september   from million in the pro forma prior year and segment margin increased to from 
the increase in margins was primarily due to lower performance based compensation and lower discretionary benefit plan expenses for consulting personnel of million and million  respectively  than in the pro forma prior year period 
after excluding the effect of these items  margin increased in over the pro forma prior year primarily in retirement and financial management and talent and organization consulting services due largely to higher revenues in these practices  while leveraging the existing cost base 
critical accounting policies and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and this annual report 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  known facts  current and expected economic conditions and  in some cases  actuarial techniques 
we periodically reevaluate these significant factors and make adjustments when facts and circumstances change  however  actual results may differ from estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and client contract loss reserves  deferred contract costs and revenues  performance based compensation  accounts receivable and unbilled work in process  goodwill and other intangible assets  retirement plans and income taxes 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues include fees generated from outsourcing contracts and from consulting services provided to our clients 
outsourcing contract terms typically range from three to five years for benefits contracts and seven to ten years for hr bpo contracts  while consulting arrangements are generally of a short term nature 
in connection with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we have contracts with multiple elements primarily in our outsourcing segment 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
eitf issue establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are not met  deliverables included in an arrangement are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and revenue is deferred until the period in which the final deliverable is provided or a predominant service level has been attained 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
revenue is then recognized using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis as adjusted primarily for volume changes  as appropriate 
our clients typically pay for consulting services either on a time and material or on a fixed fee basis 
on fixed fee engagements  revenues are recognized either as services are provided using a proportional performance method  which utilizes estimates of overall profitability and stages of project completion  or at the completion of the project  based on the facts and circumstances of the client arrangement 
contract losses on outsourcing or consulting arrangements are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and certain indirect costs  including any remaining deferred contract costs  exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
when a loss is identified  it is first recorded as an impairment of deferred contract costs related to the specific contract  if applicable  with the remaining amount recorded as a loss reserve 
estimates are monitored during the term of the contract and any changes to the estimates are recorded in the period the change is identified and may result in either an additional increase or decrease to the loss reserve 
deferred contract costs and deferred contract revenues for long term outsourcing service agreements  implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the company s systems and operating processes 
for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services going live are deferred and amortized over the period the related ongoing services revenue is recognized 
such costs may include internal and external costs for coding or creating customizations of systems  costs for conversion of client data and costs to negotiate contract terms 
for outsourcing services that are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation  as well as ongoing service delivery costs incurred prior to revenue recognition commencing are deferred and amortized over the remaining contract services period 
implementation fees are also generally received from our clients either up front or over the ongoing services period in the fee per participant 
lump sum implementation fees received from a client are initially deferred and then recognized as revenue evenly over the contract ongoing services period 
if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract  a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues and costs would then be recognized into earnings through the termination date 

table of contents performance based compensation our compensation program includes a performance based component that is determined by management and the compensation and leadership committee of our board of directors 
performance based compensation is discretionary and is based on individual  team  and total company performance 
the amount of expense for performance based compensation recognized at interim and annual reporting dates involves judgment  is based on our quarterly and annual results as compared to our internal targets  and takes into account other factors  including industry trends and the general economic environment 
annual performance based compensation levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the actual performance of the company  team or individual 
as such  accrued amounts are subject to change in future periods if actual future performance varies from performance levels anticipated in prior interim periods 
client receivables and unbilled work in process we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our client receivables and unbilled work in process based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific client s difficulty in meeting its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay amounts due to us or to others  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the client receivable or unbilled work in process to what we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other clients  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past write off history and the length of time the receivables are past due or unbilled work in process is not billed 
facts and circumstances may change  which would require us to alter our estimates of the collectibility of client receivables and unbilled work in process 
a key factor mitigating this risk is our diverse client base 
for the years ended september   and  no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues 
goodwill and other intangible assets in applying the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired have been based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
estimates of fair value have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired businesses and net assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting unit 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by other factors and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 
the evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired 
the impairment expense is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
retirement plans we provide pension benefits to certain of our employees outside of north america and other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees in north america 
the valuation of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions  which are reviewed annually 
the assumptions include rates of increases in employee compensation  interest rates used to discount liabilities  the long term rate of return on plan assets  anticipated future health care costs  and other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
the selection of assumptions is based on both short term and long term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation 
the use of different assumptions would have resulted in different measures of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
actual results in the future could differ from expected results 
we are not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believe our assumptions are appropriate 
our assumptions are listed in note the most critical assumptions pertain to the plans covering employees outside north america  as these plans are the most significant to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provisions and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
stock based compensation our employees and directors may receive awards of nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance shares  performance units  and cash based awards  and employees can also receive incentive stock options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize the related compensation cost in its financial statements 
on october  the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
upon the adoption of sfas r  the company recognized an immaterial one time gain in compensation and related expenses related to the requirement to apply an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards 
previously  the company recorded forfeitures as incurred 
the company has also elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
under sfas r  benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are now reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as prescribed under the prior accounting rules 
restricted stock awards  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are measured using the fair market value of the stock as of the grant date and are initially recorded as class a common stock and additional paid in capital on the balance sheet 
the company recognizes compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reviewed periodically and changes to the estimated forfeitures are adjusted through current period earnings 
employer payroll taxes are also recorded as expense when they become due over the vesting period 
the remaining unvested shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on sale or transfer for four years from the grant date 
the company also granted nonqualified stock options at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company s stock on the grant date 
the company applies the black scholes valuation method to compute the estimated fair value of the stock options and recognizes compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures on a straight line basis so that the award is fully expensed at the vesting date 
generally  stock options vest percent on each anniversary of the grant date  are fully vested four years from the grant date  and have a term of ten years 
prior to october   we accounted for stock based compensation under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which allowed companies to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb 
under apb  no compensation expense was 
table of contents recognized for non qualified stock option awards as the exercise price of the awards on the date of grant was equal to the current market price of the company s stock 
however  we did recognize compensation expense in connection with the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units
