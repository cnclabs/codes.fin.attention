we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees 
our business has grown rapidly since inception  resulting in substantially increased revenues 
our growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of dvds as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online dvd rentals 
we expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online dvd rentals continues to grow  a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model 
we continued to see strong growth and financial results in  with revenues achieving double digit growth from a year ago 
this growth can be attributed to an expanding subscriber base 
we added approximately million net new subscribers in  growing from million to million subscribers at december  our operating income was lower in as compared to primarily as a result of having lowered the subscription price of our most popular service plan in the fourth quarter of while increasing marketing spending in a competitive environment 

table of contents recent developments and initiatives we continue to face direct competition from blockbuster 
it remains possible that other potential entrants will offer competing services  either directly or in conjunction with others or that blockbuster will gain more traction in its current business 
we continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business 
we launched two new revenue initiatives in retail sales of previously viewed dvds and our ad sales program 
we also continue to invest resources to develop solutions for downloading movies to consumers 
our core strategy has been and remains to grow a large dvd subscription business 
however  as technology and infrastructure develop to allow effective and convenient delivery of movies over the internet and when meaningful content becomes available  we intend to offer our subscribers the choice of receiving their movies on dvd or by downloading  whichever they prefer 
key business metrics management periodically reviews certain key business metrics  within the context of our articulated performance goals  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the key business metrics include the following churn churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions  then divided by three months 
management reviews this metric to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans 
subscriber acquisition cost subscriber acquisition cost is defined as total marketing expense divided by total gross subscriber additions 
management reviews this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value 
gross margin management reviews gross margin to monitor variable costs and operating efficiency 
management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
amortization of dvd library and upfront costs we acquire dvds from studios and distributors through either direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements 
we acquire dvds for the purpose of renting them to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such  we consider our dvd library to be a productive asset  and classify our dvd library as a non current asset 
additionally  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards statement of cash flows sfas  we classify cash outflows for the acquisition of the dvd library  including any upfront non refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements  as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents we amortize our dvd library  less estimated salvage value  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over its estimated useful life 
the useful life of the new release dvds and back catalogue dvds is estimated to be year and years  respectively 
in estimating the useful life of our dvd library  we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds 
volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are recorded as a reduction of dvd library inventory when earned 
prior to july   we amortized the cost of our entire dvd library  including the capitalized portion of the initial fixed license fee  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over one year 
however  based on our periodic evaluation of both new release and back catalogue utilization for amortization purposes  we determined that back catalogue titles have a significantly longer life than previously estimated 
as a result  we revised our estimate of useful life for the back catalogue dvd library from a sum of the months accelerated method using a one year life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a three year life 
the purpose of this change is to more accurately reflect the productive life of these assets 
in accordance with apb  the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from july  new releases will continue to be amortized over a one year period 
we believe the use of the accelerated method is appropriate for the amortization of our dvd library and the initial fixed license fee because it approximates dvd utilization 
in the third quarter of  we determined that we were selling fewer previously rented dvds than estimated but at an average selling price higher than historically estimated 
we therefore revised our estimate of salvage values  on direct purchase dvds 
for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives  a salvage value of per dvd has been provided effective july  for those dvds that we do not expect to sell  no salvage value is provided 
the revenue sharing agreements enable us to obtain dvds at a lower upfront cost than under traditional direct purchase arrangements 
under the revenue sharing agreements  we share a percentage of the actual net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with the studios over a fixed period of time  or the title term  which is typically months for each dvd title 
at the end of the title term  we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio  destroying the title or purchasing the title 
in addition  we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements 
this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy 
in some cases  this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred 
we will continue to periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvd library 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation expenses in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
in light of the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  we re evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the value of stock options beginning in the second quarter of expected volatility we determined that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock 
therefore  we revised the volatility factor used to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards beginning in the second quarter of to be based on a blend of historical volatility of our common 
table of contents stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock 
prior to the second quarter of  we estimated expected volatility based on historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
expected life prior to the third quarter of  we granted stock options  which generally vested over three to four year periods 
since the third quarter of  we began granting fully vested stock options to our employees on a monthly basis 
as a result  we changed the expected life from years to years 
in the second quarter of  we revised our estimate of expected life based on our review of historical patterns for exercises of stock options 
we bifurcated our option grants into two employee groupings executive and non executive based on exercise behavior and changed the estimate of the expected life from years for all option grants in the first quarter of to years for one group and year for the other group beginning in the second quarter of in the second quarter of  in light of the guidance in sab  we further refined our estimate of expected life for option grants to years for one group and years for the other group from years and year  respectively 
in determining the estimate  we considered several factors  including the historical option exercise behavior of our employees and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted 
we shall continue to monitor the assumptions used to measure stock based compensation 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   our deferred tax assets  primarily the tax benefits of loss carryforwards  were offset in full by a valuation allowance because of our history of losses through the first quarter of  limited profitable quarters to date and the competitive landscape of online dvd rentals 
as a result of our analysis of expected future income at december   it was considered more likely than not that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was no longer required resulting in the release of a previously recorded allowance generating a million tax benefit 
deferred tax assets do not include the tax benefits attributable to approximately million of excess tax deductions related to stock options 
these benefits will only be recorded when realized on tax returns and will be credited to equity at that time 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination

the remaining portion of the initial upfront fee represents prepaid revenue sharing and this amount is expensed as revenue sharing expenses as dvds subject to revenue sharing agreements are shipped to subscribers 
the terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles

a provision for estimated shortfall  if any  on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
additionally  the terms of some revenue sharing agreement with studios provide for rebates based on achieving specified performance levels 
we accrue for these rebates as earned based on historical title performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term
