questions regarding the public reference room may be directed to the sec at industry background the life sciences industry uses bioassays to detect the presence of certain biochemicals  proteins or nucleic acid in a sample 
drug discovery  genetic analysis  pharmacogenomics  clinical diagnostics and general biomedical research all use bioassays 
for example  bioassays can be used to measure the attraction  or affinity  between a chemical compound and a disease target for drug discovery and development  assist physicians in prescribing the appropriate tailored drug therapy based on the patient s unique genetic makeup  a process known as pharmacogenetics  detect genetic variations  such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  and measure the presence and quantity of biochemicals in a patient s blood  other body fluid or tissue to assist physicians in diagnosing  treating or monitoring disease conditions 
the life sciences user either purchases bioassays in the form of off the shelf kits  develops them internally or utilizes a customized service to meet their specific needs 
although it is important to note that our xmap technology is relevant to only a subset of the total life sciences market  industry reports estimated the total global market for tools and consumables used in drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research to have been approximately billion in and is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately

nucleic acid testing in clinical diagnostics and biomedical research 
microfluidics chips miniaturized liquid handling system on a chip biomedical research microtiter plate based assays plastic trays with discrete wells in which assays are fixed drug discovery  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research our xmap technology our xmap technology combines existing biological testing techniques with advanced digital signal processing and proprietary software 
with our technology  discrete bioassays are performed on the surface of color coded microspheres 
these microspheres are read in a compact analyzer that utilizes lasers and high speed digital signal processing to simultaneously identify the bioassay and measure the results 
the key features of xmap technology include the following multi analyte multi format xmap technology has been designed to simultaneously perform up to distinct bioassays in a single tube or well of a microtiter plate using only a small amount of sample 
moreover  unlike most existing technologies that are dedicated to only one type of bioassay  xmap can perform multiple types of assays including enzymatic  genetic and immunologic tests on the same instrumentation platform 
flexibility scalability xmap technology allows flexibility in customizing test panels 
panels can be modified to include new bioassays in the same tube by adding additional microsphere sets 
it is also scalable  meaning that there is no change in the manufacturing process and only minimal changes to the required labor to produce a small or large number of microsphere based tests 
throughput our technology is currently able to perform up to tests in a single tube permitting up to  unattended tests to be detected in less than an hour with only a small amount of sample 
rapid sample analysis permits efficient use for high throughput applications 
ease of use most xmap bioassays are simple to perform 
a test sample is added to a solution containing microspheres that have been coated with reagents 
the solution is then processed through our xmap technology system which incorporates proprietary software to automate data acquisition and analysis in real time 

table of contents cost effective we have designed our xmap technology to be cost effective for customers compared to competitive techniques such as microarrays or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa 
in addition  microsphere based bioassays are inexpensive compared to other technologies such as biochips 
polystyrene microspheres  approximately microns in diameter  are a fundamental component of the xmap technology 
we purchase and manufacture microspheres and  in a proprietary process  dye them with varying intensities of a red and a near infrared dye to achieve up to distinct colors 
the specific dye proportions permit each color coded microsphere to be readily identified based on its distinctive fluorescent signature 
our customers create bioassays by attaching different biochemical reactants to each distinctly colored microsphere set 
the microsphere sets can then be combined in test panels as required by the user  with a current maximum of tests per panel 
to perform a bioassay using xmap technology  a researcher attaches biochemicals  or reagents  to one or more sets of color coded microspheres  which are then mixed with a test sample 
this mixture is injected into the xmap analyzer  where the microspheres pass single file in a fluid stream through two laser beams 
the first laser excites the internal dyes that are used to identify the color of the microsphere and the test being performed on the surface of the microsphere 
the second laser excites a fluorescent dye captured on the surface of the microspheres that is used to quantify the result of the bioassay taking place 
our proprietary optics  digital signal processors and software record the fluorescent signature of each microsphere and compare the results to the known identity of that color coded microsphere set 
the results are analyzed and displayed in real time with data stored on the computer database for reference  evaluation and analysis 
business strategy our primary goal continues to be the establishment of our xmap technology as the industry standard for performing bioassays by transforming luminex from a technology based company to a more market driven  customer focused company 
to achieve this goal  we have implemented and are pursuing the following strategies focus on key market segments in the spring of  we completed a strategic study using the services of a consulting firm with extensive experience in the life sciences industry

such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination  including remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of  or conditions caused by  us or others  or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on  under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigation  remediation and monitoring requirements under federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities 
we do not believe that we have been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted  we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future  or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
moreover  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or 
table of contents the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact our strategic partners  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated component companies 
employees as of march   we had a total of employees  including contract employees  as compared with as of december  at december  we had employees  including contract employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have not experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that relations with our employees are good 
item a 
risk factors we have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we have incurred significant net losses since our inception  including losses of million for the year ended december   million in and million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
to achieve profitability  we need to generate and sustain substantially higher revenue while achieving reasonable cost and expense levels 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the time frame expected by securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
furthermore  as we continue to incur losses and utilize cash to support operations  we may further decrease the cash available to the company 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments totaled million  an increase of million from million at december   primarily attributable to more efficient management of our inventory levels and receipt of significant license fees 
we do not know when or if we will become profitable 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis 
we expect our operating results to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the sale of bioassay testing devices typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital by partners 
accordingly  the sales cycle associated with our products typically is lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks  including partners budgetary constraints  inventory management practices  regulatory approval and internal acceptance reviews  all of which are beyond our control 
as a result of this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
the vast majority of our system sales are made to our strategic partners 
our partners typically purchase instruments in three phases during their commercialization cycle first  instruments necessary to support internal assay development  second  instruments for sales force demonstrations  and finally  instruments for resale to their customers 
as a result  most of our system placements are highly dependent on the commercialization timetables of our strategic partners and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as our strategic partners move from phase to phase 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
because of the effect of bulk purchases  we continue to experience fluctuations in the percentage of our quarterly revenues derived from our highest margin items  consumables and royalties 
our gross margin is highly dependent upon the mix of revenue components each quarter 
these fluctuations contribute to the variability and lack of predictability of both gross margin percentage and total gross profit from quarter to quarter 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
our success depends largely on the establishment and maintenance of successful relationships with our strategic partners 
currently  a limited number of strategic partners constitute a majority of our revenue and the loss of any one of these partners could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the development and commercialization of our xmap technology is highly dependent on our ability to establish successful strategic relationships with a number of partners 
as of december   we had strategic partners who were paying royalties and had either commercialized products using the luminex platform or were reselling 
table of contents our products 
furthermore  for the year ended december   two partners individually represented greater than of the company s revenue and collectively represented of total revenue bio rad laboratories  inc  one lambda  inc 

we had three additional partners who individually represented or more of our total revenue and collectively represented of the company s revenue for the year ended december  in total  for the year ended december   we had five partners who represented of our total revenue 
for comparative purposes for the year ended december   two partners individually represented greater than of the company s revenue and collectively represented of our total revenue 
we had two additional partners who individually represented or more of our total revenue and collectively represented of the company s revenue for the year ended december  in total  for the year ended december   we had four partners who represented of our total revenue 
the loss of any of our significant strategic partners  or any of our significant customers  could have a material adverse effect on our growth and future results of operations 
delays in implementation  delays in obtaining regulatory approval  changes in strategy or the financial difficulty of our strategic partners for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to enter into agreements with additional strategic partners depends in part on convincing them that our technology can help achieve and accelerate their goals or efforts 
we will expend substantial funds and management efforts with no assurance that any additional strategic relationships will result 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate additional strategic agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that current or future strategic partners will not pursue or develop alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
some of the companies we are targeting as strategic partners offer products competitive with our xmap technology  which may hinder or prevent strategic relationships 
termination of strategic relationships  or the failure to enter into a sufficient number of additional agreements on favorable terms  could reduce sales of our products  lower margins on our products and limit the creation of market demand and acceptance 
in addition  we have entered into non exclusive relationships with most of our existing strategic partners 
the lack of exclusivity could deter existing strategic partners from commercializing xmap technology and may deter new strategic partners from entering into agreements with luminex 
the majority of our future revenues will come from sales of our systems and the development and sale of bioassay kits utilizing our technology by our strategic partners and from use of our technology by our strategic partners in performing services offered to third parties 
we believe that our strategic partners will have economic incentives to develop and market these products  but we cannot predict future sales and royalty revenues because most of our existing strategic partner agreements do not include minimum purchase requirements or royalty commitments 
in addition  we do not have the right or ability to provide incentives to our strategic partners sales personnel to sell products based on xmap technology or to control the timing of the release of products by our strategic partners 
the amount of these revenues will depend on a variety of factors that are outside our control  including the amount and timing of resources that current and future strategic partners devote to develop and market products incorporating our technology 
further  the development and marketing of certain bioassay kits will require our strategic partners to obtain governmental approvals  which could delay or prevent their commercialization efforts 
if our current or future strategic partners do not successfully develop and market products based on our technology and obtain necessary government approvals  our revenues from product sales and royalties will be significantly reduced 
if our technology and products do not become widely used in the life sciences industry  it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable 
life sciences companies have historically conducted biological tests using a variety of technologies  including bead based analysis 
our xmap technology is relatively new and unproven  in certain testing areas  and the use of our technology by life sciences companies is limited 
the commercial success of our technology will depend upon its widespread adoption as a method to perform bioassays 
in order to be successful  we must convince potential partners to utilize our system instead of competing technologies 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to 
table of contents convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies for pharmaceutical  research  clinical and biomedical testing and analysis  encourage these partners to develop and market products using our technology  manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost  obtain and maintain sufficient pricing and royalties from partners on such luminex products  and place and service sufficient quantities of our products  including the ability to provide the level of service required in the mainstream clinical diagnostics market segment 
because of these and other factors  our products may not gain sufficient market acceptance to achieve profitability 
our reliance on strategic partners to market our products makes forecasting difficult 
primarily as a result of our reliance on partner performance  it is difficult to accurately forecast future operating results 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
the level of our revenues will depend upon the rate and timing of the adoption of our technology as a method to perform bioassays 
due to our limited operating history  predicting this timing and rate of adoption is difficult 
in addition  we currently anticipate that the vast majority of future sales of our products and products incorporating our technology will be made by our strategic partners 
for the following reasons  estimating the timing and amount of sales of these products that may be made by our strategic partners is particularly difficult we have no control over the timing or extent of product development  marketing or sale of our products by our strategic partners 
most of our strategic partners are not committed to minimum purchase commitments  and we do not control the incentives provided by our strategic partners to their sales personnel 
a significant number of our strategic partners intend to produce clinical diagnostic applications that may need to be approved by the food and drug administration  or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions outside of the united states 
certain strategic partners may have unique requirements for their applications and systems 
assisting the various strategic partners may strain our research and development and manufacturing resources 
to the extent that we are not able to timely assist our strategic partners  the commercialization of their products will likely be delayed 
certain strategic partners may fail to deliver products that satisfy market requirements  or such products may fail to perform properly 
we have limited access to partner confidential corporate information 
a sudden unexpected change in ownership  strategy or other material event could adversely impact partner purchases of our products 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and we may not have the resources necessary to compete successfully 
we compete with companies in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development and production of similar products 
we will continue to face intense competition from existing competitors and other companies seeking to develop new technologies 
many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  scientific  research  marketing  sales  distribution  service and other resources than we do 
these companies may develop technologies that are superior alternatives to our technologies or may be more effective at commercializing their technologies in products 

table of contents the life sciences industry is characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation 
we may need to develop new technologies for our products to remain competitive 
one or more of our current or future competitors could render our present or future products obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances 
in addition  the introduction or announcement of new products by us or others could result in a delay of or decrease in sales of existing products  as we await regulatory approvals and as customers evaluate these new products 
we may also encounter other problems in the process of delivering new products to the marketplace  including products from our biosciences group  such as problems related to design  development or manufacturing of such products  and as result we may be unsuccessful in selling such products 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively against current technologies  as well as to respond effectively to technological advances by developing and marketing products that are competitive in the continually changing technological landscape 
our success depends on our ability to service and support our products directly or in collaboration with our strategic partners 
to the extent that the company or its strategic partners fail to maintain a high quality level of service and support for xmap technology products  there is a risk that the perceived quality of our xmap technology products will be diminished in the marketplace 
likewise  the company may fail to provide the level  quantity or quality  of service expected by the marketplace 
this could result in slower adoption rates and lower than anticipated utilization of xmap products causing a material adverse affect on our business 
the intellectual property rights we rely upon to protect the technology underlying our products may not be adequate to maintain market exclusivity 
inadequate intellectual property protection could enable third parties to exploit our technology or use very similar technology and could reduce our ability to distinguish our products in the market 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain  protect and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets 
any patents we own may not afford full protection for our technology and products 
others may challenge our patents and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed or invalidated 
in addition  our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the united states or foreign countries 
competitors may develop products that are not covered by our patents 
further  there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the us patent and trademark office  and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years 
we have obtained patents in the united states and foreign jurisdictions directed to various aspects and applications of our technology 
we have pending applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
in japan  due to a procedural omission  we are unable to obtain patent protection for our method of real time detection and quantification of multiple analytes from a single sample similar to the protection we have obtained in the united states 
although we are pursuing patent protection in japan for other aspects of our technology  we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and marketing technologies similar to our xmap technology in japan 
we require our employees  consultants  strategic partners and other third parties to execute confidentiality agreements 
our employees and third party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original expressions and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
in addition  the company has implemented a patent process to file patent applications on its key technology 
however  we cannot guarantee that these agreements or this patent process will provide us with adequate protection against improper use of our intellectual property or disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  in some situations  these agreements may conflict with  or be subject to  the rights of third parties with whom our employees  consultants or advisors have prior employment or consulting relationships 
further  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
our failure to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may have to initiate legal proceedings against third parties  such as infringement suits or interference proceedings 
these legal proceedings could be expensive  take significant 
table of contents time and or divert management s attention from other business concerns 
these proceedings may cause us to lose the benefit of some of our intellectual property rights  the loss of which may inhibit or preclude our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market 
we also may provoke these third parties to assert claims against us 
the patent position of companies like ours generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
no consistent policy has emerged from the us patent and trademark office or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under patents like ours 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may find it necessary  if threatened  to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court that we do not infringe on the proprietary rights of others or that their rights are invalid or unenforceable 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could affect our profitability 
furthermore  litigation is time consuming and could divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  we may have to pay damages and could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
any required license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
moreover  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are aware of a european patent granted to dr 
ioannis tripatzis  which covers certain testing agents and certain methods of their use 
dr 
tripatzis has publicly stated his belief that his european patent covers aspects of our technology if practiced in europe 
this european patent expired in november we have only produced our products in limited quantities and we may experience problems in scaling our manufacturing operations or delays or component shortages that could limit the growth of our revenue 
to date  we have produced our products in limited quantities compared to the quantities necessary to achieve desired revenue growth 
we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities or maintain consistency between differing lots of consumables 
if we encounter difficulties in scaling our manufacturing operations as a result of  among other things  quality control and quality assurance and availability of component and raw material supplies  we will likely experience reduced sales of our products  increased repair or re engineering costs due to product returns and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers  any of which would reduce our revenues and gross margins 
we presently outsource certain aspects of the assembly of our systems to contract manufacturers 
because of a long lead time to delivery  we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs 
we recently increased our flexibility to purchase strategic components within shorter lead times by entering into supply agreements with the suppliers of these components 
although we attempt to match our parts inventory and production capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand  to the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates  we may experience continued constraints in our systems production and delivery capacity  which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period 
should the company s need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate  we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials 
in an effort to control costs in the last quarter of manufacturing implemented a lean production system 
managing the change from discrete to continuous flow production requires time and management commitment 
implementation of lean initiatives and our supply chain capabilities may result in part shortages that delay shipments and cause fluctuations in revenue in a given period 
certain key components of our product line are currently purchased from a limited number of outside sources and may only be available through a limited number of providers 
we do not have agreements with all of our suppliers 
our reliance on our suppliers and contract manufacturers exposes us to risks including the possibility that one or more of our suppliers or our assemblers that do not have supply agreements with the company could terminate their services at any time without penalty  
table of contents the potential obsolescence and or inability of our suppliers to obtain required components  the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternate sources of supply or manufacturing services  the inability to qualify alternate sources without impacting performance claims of our products  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternate suppliers or assemblers  and increases in prices of raw materials and key components 
consequently  in the event that supplies of components or work performed by any of our assemblers are delayed or interrupted for any reason  our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired 
the capital spending policies of our customers has a significant effect on the demand for our products 
customers include clinical diagnostic  pharmaceutical  biotechnological  chemical and industrial companies  and the capital spending policies of these companies can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
these policies are based on a wide variety of factors  including governmental regulation or price controls  the resources available for purchasing research equipment  the spending priorities among various types of analytical equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods 
any decrease in capital spending by life sciences companies could cause our revenues to decline 
as a result  we are subject to significant volatility in revenue 
therefore  our operating results can be materially affected negatively and positively by the spending policies and priorities of our customers 
if we fail to comply with government regulations that affect our business  we could be subject to enforcement actions  injunctions and civil and criminal penalties that could delay or prevent marketing of our products 
the production  testing  labeling  marketing and distribution of our products for some purposes and products based on our technology are subject to governmental regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and by similar agencies in other countries 
some of our products and products based on our technology for in vitro diagnostic purposes are subject to approval or clearance by the fda prior to marketing for commercial use 
to date  strategic partners have obtained such approvals or clearances 
others are anticipated 
the process of obtaining necessary fda clearances or approvals can be time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
further  clearance or approval may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the product may be marketed or to whom it may be marketed 
in addition  because some of our products employ laser technology  we are also required to comply with fda requirements relating to radiation performance safety standards cfr and 
approved or cleared medical device products are subject to continuing fda requirements relating to  among others  manufacturing quality control and quality assurance  maintenance of records and documentation  registration and listing  import export  adverse event and other reporting  distribution  labeling and promotion and advertising of medical devices 
our inability  or the inability of our strategic partners  to obtain required regulatory approval or clearance on a timely or acceptable basis could harm our business 
in addition  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could subject us or our strategic partners to regulatory enforcement action  including warning letters  product seizures  recalls  withdrawal of clearances or approvals  restrictions on or injunctions against marketing our products or products based on our technology  and civil and criminal penalties 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside the united states 
these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our medical device products to requests for product data or certifications 
as part of the council directive of february  weee  we are expected to comply with certain requirements regarding the labeling of our products containing electronic devices beginning on august  in each of the eu member states where our regulated products are distributed 
while we are taking steps to comply with the requirements of weee  we cannot be certain that we will comply with the national stage implementation of weee in all member states 
our products are currently exempt from the council 
table of contents directive of january   restriction of hazardous substances rohs  which requires the removal of certain specified hazardous substances for certain products beginning july  in each of the member states 
however  the european union has indicated that it may include medical devices  including some of our products  under the jurisdiction of rohs 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
failure to comply with applicable federal  state and foreign medical device laws and regulations may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relating to  among other things  environmental protection and work place safety 
our strategic partners and customers expect our organization to operate on an established quality management system compliant with fda quality system regulations and industry standards  the in vitro diagnostic directive ec of october directive as implemented nationally in the eu member states and industry standards  such as iso we became iso certified in march and self declared our luminex and luminex devices are in conformity with article  article  annex i essential requirements  and annex iii  and the additional provisions of ivdd ec as of december  subsequent audits are carried out annually to ensure we maintain our system in substantial compliance with iso and other applicable regulations and industry standards 
we became iso and canadian medical device conformity assessment system cmdcas certified in july failure to maintain compliance with fda  cmdcas and eu regulations and other medical device laws  or to obtain applicable registrations where required  could reduce our competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete and also decrease satisfaction and confidence levels with our partners 
if we become subject to product liability claims  we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of human diagnostic and therapeutic products 
although we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks and we have indemnity protections in our supplier agreements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities 
a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or claim that is outside or exceeds our indemnity protections in our supplier agreements or a recall of one of our products would have to be paid out of our cash reserves 
if third party payors increasingly restrict payments for healthcare expenses or fail to adequately pay for multi analyte testing  we may experience reduced sales which would hurt our business and our business prospects 
third party payors  such as government entities  health maintenance organizations and private insurers  are restricting payments for healthcare 
these restrictions may decrease demand for our products and the price we can charge 
increasingly  medicaid and other third party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical services  including clinical diagnostic tests 
they are also attempting to contain costs by limiting coverage and the reimbursement level of tests and other healthcare products 
without adequate coverage and reimbursement  consumer demand for tests will decrease 
decreased demand could cause sales of our products  and sales and services by our strategic partners  to fall 
in addition  decreased demand could place pressure on us  or our strategic partners  to lower prices on these products or services  resulting in lower margins 
reduced sales or margins by us  or our strategic partners  would hurt our business  profitability and business prospects 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing our acquisition strategy 
acquisitions of assets or entities designed to accelerate the implementation of our strategic plan are an element of our long term strategy 
we may be unable to identify and complete appropriate acquisitions in a timely manner and no assurance can be provided that the market price of potential business acquisitions will be acceptable 
in addition  many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have and may be willing to pay more for these businesses or selected assets 
should we identify suitable acquisition targets  we may be unable to complete acquisitions or obtain the financing  if necessary  for these acquisitions on terms favorable to us 
potential acquisitions pose a number of risks  including  among others  that 
table of contents we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business  future acquisitions may require us to issue capital stock or spend significant cash or may result in a decrease in our future operating income or operating margins  we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquisitions as a result of inherent risks and uncertainties  including difficulties integrating acquired businesses or retaining their personnel  partners  customers or other key relationships and risks that acquired entities may not operate profitably or that acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance  and acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities 
our operating results may be affected by current economic and political conditions 
the continuing events in the middle east and concern for future terrorist attacks  leave many economic and political uncertainties 
these uncertainties could adversely affect our business and revenues in the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain our management and staff 
we depend on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including our chief executive officer  marketing  research and development  technical support  technical service and sales staff 
the loss of services of key members of management could delay or reduce our product development  marketing and sales and technical support efforts 
in addition  recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and other personnel to perform research and development  technical support  technical service and marketing and sales work will be critical to our success 
there is a shortage in our industry of qualified management and scientific personnel  and competition for these individuals is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract additional and retain existing personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price 
this volatility is in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and interest rates  instability in the united states and other financial markets and the ongoing and possible escalation of unrest in the middle east  other armed hostilities or further acts or threats of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results from historical results or estimates of results prepared by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the life science  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our common stock  and the potential adverse impact of the secondary trading of our stock on foreign exchanges which are subject to less regulatory oversight than the nasdaq national market  without our permission  and the activity of the market makers of our stock on such exchanges  including the risk that such market makers may engage in naked short 
table of contents sales and or other deceptive trading practices which may artificially depress or otherwise affect the price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq stock market and the market for technology companies in particular  has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life sciences companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we are also subject to certain provisions of delaware law that could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

item legal proceedings on april   the company was served with a complaint  filed by rules based medicine  inc rbm in state district court in travis county  texas seeking a declaratory judgment that the formation of healthmap laboratories  inc subsequently renamed the biophysical corporation did not constitute a usurpation of an rbm corporate opportunity and that rbm has the necessary contractual license rights under its existing agreement with the company to perform certain testing services on behalf of biophysical corporation 
on may   we filed an answer to this complaint denying all claims brought by rbm 
on june   the parties entered into an agreement  which was subsequently entered with the court on june  pursuant to this agreement  the parties agreed that rbm would not file any claims related to this matter against the company until august   and that the company would not file any claims related to this matter against rbm until august   in order to continue to pursue settlement negotiations 
the parties were unable to reach agreement on the terms of settlement 
rbm re filed its lawsuit against us on august   seeking a declaratory judgment against us as set forth above 
in response  we re filed its answer and counterclaims against rbm  as well as new claims against mark chandler and craig benson  officers of rbm  on august  the parties are currently proceeding with discovery 
in the opinion of management there are no pending legal proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
adversarial proceedings and litigation  however  subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable decisions and rulings could occur which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows for a period in which such a decision or rulings occur  or future periods

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included below in item and risk factors included above in item a of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview during  a number of factors contributed to our financial performance i we entered into new agreements with market leaders in their respective spaces  ii several of our existing partnerships gained traction during the year  iii we benefited from industry consolidation that put our products and technology in the hands of major market participants who have significantly more sales and marketing resources to get our products in the hands of end users  iv we maintained our emphasis on product development and enhancement by our research and development group including the rollout of the company s first new product in a number of years with the launch of the luminex lx  v in terms of awareness  we experienced over a increase in articles placed in scientific peer review journals which historically and across the healthcare market has been a good indicator of growth rates and acceptance of technology in the marketplace  vi increased selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of a building our infrastructure to accommodate the expanded marketing and business development functions necessary to execute against our strategic plan  b professional fees and other expenses related to our intellectual property estate  and c a move towards the issuance of restricted stock in lieu of stock options as a form of long term incentive compensation  and vii increased penetration of our target markets by our partners 
system sales for the year ended december  decreased slightly to lx systems and hts from lx systems and hts in the year ended december  although our total system sales are down relative to the prior year  they fall within our expected range of to systems per quarter as previously disclosed 
we currently expect our quarterly system sales to remain within this range in the breadth of the range is primarily a function of the timing of our partners purchases and our inability  in the aggregate  to provide a more precise estimate 
during the third quarter of  the latest advancement of our line of microsphere based multiplexed detection instrument  the luminex lx  became available 
the lx is designed around the same xmap technology as the luminex lx  enabling customers who convert to this system to continue to use applications validated on earlier luminex systems 
our royalty revenue increased to million  from million in  representing approximately million in royalty bearing sales by our partners reported during as additional partners commercialize and expand their menu offerings  we expect royalty revenues will continue to grow 
we believe that this increase is an indication of the acceptance and utilization of our technology over a broader base 
in addition  another key indicator of technology acceptance is long term consumable purchases 
for the thirteenth consecutive quarter our month moving average of consumable sales has increased 
at december   our month moving average of quarterly consumable sales was million 
as a result of the variability of the revenue mix  we have experienced some related variability in both absolute gross profit and the corresponding gross margin percentage 
for comparative purposes  we had gross profit in and of million and million  respectively 
additionally  gross margin percentage over the same periods was and  respectively 
the fluctuations in both gross profit and gross margin percentage on a quarterly basis can be primarily attributed to the variability of the revenue mix and secondarily to the increases in the average price of our systems in total consumable and royalty revenue  our highest margin items  accounted for of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for year ended december  the increase is the result of an increased focus on development of our system  consumable and software products 
our intent is to continue to expand our research and development efforts in the near term 
these efforts include the creation in of our luminex biosciences group and its continuing efforts to assist in 
table of contents the expansion of applications for use on our platforms and expanded focus on system  consumable and software product development 
during  expenses related to sales and marketing increased  or million  as a result of building our infrastructure to accommodate the expanded marketing and business development functions necessary to execute against our strategic plan 
these expansions were initiated by the hiring of greg gosch  our vice president of marketing and sales  in october and russell bradley  our vice president of business development and strategic planning  in may and included the related increases of infrastructure in their organizations 
during  we incurred increased professional fees related to expanding  supporting and defending our intellectual property estate and strategic partnership relationships 
for the year ended december   the company incurred approximately  of additional professional fees over the year ended december   primarily attributable to the litigation settlements and other intellectual property matters 
additionally  as indicated in the company s financial statements for the year ended december   the company settled a lawsuit with dynal biotech  llc on june  the company recorded  of expense related to its portion of the settlement among dynal biotech  llc  miraibio corporation and us 
during the year ended we moved towards the issuance of restricted stock in lieu of stock options as a form of long term incentive compensation for our directors and employees 
the move was made for several reasons including extension of our existing equity plans and the impending implementation of sfas no 
r  required to be implemented for the company beginning january  during the year ended december  and the company recorded million and  of stock compensation expense  respectively  related to restricted stock issuances to directors and employees of the company 
as a result of the transition  stock compensation expense related to restricted stock issuances increased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  had the company elected not to make the transition to restricted stock  no compensation expense would have been recorded for employee and director options issued at the prevailing market price on the date of issuance in accordance with apb our ability to achieve profitability continues to depend upon our ability to establish and maintain successful strategic partnerships with companies that will develop and market products incorporating our technology and market and distribute our systems and consumables 
our strategic partners may develop application specific bioassay kits for use on our systems that they will sell to their customers  may perform testing services for third parties using our technology or may buy our consumable products and then resell those products to their customers  all generating royalties 
at december   we had over partners and commercialized partners 
commercialized partners are those partners who have either released commercialized products based on the luminex platform or are redistributing our products and are reporting royalties 
as of december   our partners have obtained k clearances for assays and software packages running on luminex xmap technology 
as we continue to strive towards making xmap technology a standard for performing bioassays within our key market segments  we believe that we need to continue to concentrate on the following objectives i sustain our focus on the segments of the life science and diagnostics markets where we believe we have a competitive advantage  ii continue to make strategic investments in the technology through our research and development efforts  iii grow our installed base  and the related product line to drive increased utilization per system  iv forge key partnerships with market leaders to broaden the use of and accelerate market acceptance of our technology  v maintain our strong financial position and sound corporate governance  vi expand our footprint in the marketplace in both bio defense and assay development  including through the opportunistic pursuit of acquisitions  and vii to continue our progress toward profitability 
a critical component of these objectives will be to continually enhance our position via a customer focused development process and a customer focused service strategy 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology  provides testing services to third parties using our technology or resells our consumables 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners  therefore  the underlying end user sales may be related to prior periods 
we also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
total deferred revenue as of december  was million and primarily consisted of i unamortized license fees for non exclusive licenses and patent rights to certain luminex technologies in the amount of million  ii unamortized revenue related to extended service contracts in the amount of million  and iii upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of products or to be applied towards future royalty payments in the amount of  upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or apply such amounts against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
at december   the two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory were i a specific reserve for inventory items that we no longer use in the manufacture of our products or that no longer meet our specifications and ii a reserve against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
the total estimated allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses historically have been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our significant customers  or a deterioration in the economic environment  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts

other revenue  comprised of training revenue  shipping revenue  miscellaneous part sales  amortized license fees and special project revenue  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in special project revenue and a one time contractual adjustment of  related to unfulfilled purchase commitments by one of our partners that occurred in the decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortized license fees 
for the year ended december   we had million of part sales   of shipping revenue   in amortized license fees   in training revenue and  of other miscellaneous revenue

as of december  and  working capital was million and million  respectively 
we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term and long term  interest 
table of contents bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and us corporate debt securities with maturities of two years or less 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  significant items affecting operating cash flow for the period were net inventory decreases of million  net deferred revenue increases of million and net increases of accounts payable of million 
based on the current financial position and improvements in  we expect operating cashflow for to result in a modest use of cash 
cash used in investing was million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  in  we made purchases of property  plant and equipment of million primarily for leasehold improvements 
currently  exclusive of changes in investments  we expect cash used in investing activities to be primarily for purchases of property  plant and equipment and to be approximately equivalent with our operating expenses during the year ended december  were million  of which million was research and development expense and million was selling  general and administrative expense 
we currently expect that increases in operating expenses for would be substantially offset by increases in gross profit 
additionally  we expect research and development expenses to remain between and of total revenue in our expected increase in research and development expenses for relative to is a result of our content strategy and expanded focus on product development 
our expected increase in selling  general and administrative expenses over those of is primarily a result of increased stock compensation expense related to the required adoption of fas r and increased professional fees related to the development and protection of our intellectual property estate 
we presently outsource certain aspects of the assembly of our systems to contract manufacturers 
we have noncancelable purchase requirements with certain of our component suppliers that require us to take delivery of a minimum number of component parts for our products or the cost per unit will increase  which would adversely impact our gross margin 
we are not otherwise committed to scheduled purchase requirements 
however  because of a long lead time to delivery  we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new technology  costs associated with strategic acquisitions  the status of competitive products and potential cost associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property 
additionally  actions taken based on recommendations of our strategic consulting study or the ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital equipment requirements and other expected liquidity requirements through based upon our current operating plan and structure  management anticipates total cash use for to be approximately to million  giving us an anticipated balance in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments at december  of to million 
factors that could affect this estimate  in addition to those listed above  include i continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience  ii our ability to manage our inventory levels consistent with past practices  iii our ability to maintain our net loss at levels comparable to  iv settlement of other accrued liabilities  and v signing of partnership agreements which include significant up front license fees 
we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and deployment of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 

table of contents contractual obligations we currently have approximately million in non cancelable obligations for the next months 
these obligations are included in our estimated cash usage during the following table reflects the company s total current non cancelable obligations by period in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years non cancelable rental obligations non cancelable purchase obligations total these obligations are primarily a result of normal inventory purchases 
purchase obligations do not extend beyond a year  however  we would expect future years to have purchase commitments that will arise in the ordinary course of business and will generally increase or decrease according to fluctuations in overall sales volume 
employment contracts the company has entered into employment contracts with certain of its key executives 
generally certain amounts may become payable in the event the company terminates the executives employment without cause 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a direct adverse effect on our operations 
however  a substantial increase in product and manufacturing costs and personnel related expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the event these expenses increase at a faster pace than we can increase our system  consumable and royalty rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which established the fair value based method of accounting as preferable for share based compensation awarded to employees and encouraged  but did not require entities to adopt it until july  on april   the securities and exchange commission announced that it would provide for a phased in implementation process that allowed non small business registrants with a fiscal year ended december  an extension until january  to adopt sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative to use apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which allowed entities to account for share based compensation arrangements with employees according to the intrinsic value method 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award

as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future  however  as of january  there was approximately million of estimated future option expense related to unvested stock options 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in an accounting principle  such as a change in nondiscretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt the provisions of sfas effective january  the impact of sfas will depend on an accounting change  if any  in a future period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income received on our cash balances is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in instruments that meet the definition of cash equivalents or in short term investments and are held to maturity 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield an approximate variance in overall investment return 
due to the nature of our investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
all payments for our products  including sales to foreign customers  are required to be made in us dollars  therefore  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
accordingly  our foreign currency and currency market risk is limited
