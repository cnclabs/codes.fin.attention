critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements 
these policies include estimates and significant judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expense  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continues to evaluate its estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  these policies require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the case of the company s critical accounting policies  these estimates and judgments are based on its historical experience  terms of existing contracts  the company s observance of trends in the industry  information provided by its customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company believes the following accounting policies and estimates require management to make 
table of contents the most difficult judgments in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical

revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for product sales with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company s sales contracts generally provide for the customer to accept title and risk of loss when the product leaves the company s facilities 
when shipping terms or local laws do not allow for passage of title and risk of loss at the shipping point  the company defers recognizing revenue until title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company classifies customer invoiced shipping and handling as revenue and shipping and handling costs as cost of sales

revenue under multiple element arrangements is recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under this method  if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is based on fair value and determined by vendor objective evidence voe  and recognized at the time of delivery 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  the company defers the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if the company does not have fair value for the undelivered element  it recognizes the revenue upon the the delivery of the undelivered element 
maintenance or service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
for business units that sell software licenses or products in which the software is considered more than incidental  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa s statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
license revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant obligations with regard to installation or implementation remain  fees are fixed or determinable  collectability is probable  and customer acceptance  when applicable  is obtained 
the company allocates revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
hardware and software maintenance is marketed under annual and multi year arrangements and revenue is recognized ratably over the contracted maintenance term 
the company provides engineering services to some of its customers on a contractual basis and recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the company estimates the percentage of completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs to complete the project 
if the company does not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue and related costs are deferred and recognized upon completion of the contract 
when total cost estimates exceed total revenues  the company accrues for the estimated losses immediately 
deferred revenue is comprised of  maintenance and other service revenues for which payment has been received and for which services have not yet been performed and  revenues related to delivered components of a multiple element arrangement for which vendor objective evidence voe of fair value has not been determined for components not yet delivered or accepted by the customer

the choice of a valuation technique  and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions for that technique  involve significant judgments 
these judgments reflect management s assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options the company issues  based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
the company s judgments could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change over time  and any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
management believes that its estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary for excess and obsolete inventory 
write downs are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory 
if actual demand for the company s products is less than its estimates  or the company experiences a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional write downs for existing inventories might be recorded in future periods 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and accounts receivable

while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  there is no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since the accounts receivable are concentrated among relatively few customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 

table of contents warranty reserve the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  its warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred to correct product failures 
should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates which are based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect the company s operating results 
generally  the company warrants that its products will perform in all material respects in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the products to the customer for a period ranging from to months from the date of delivery 
investments in and advances to affiliated companies the company has investments in companies whose business relates to the company s strategic focus 
investment in companies over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method if the company holds greater than and or less of the voting stock 
investments in companies over which the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method 
in assessing the recoverability of these investments  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments based upon changes in the company s overall business strategy  the financial condition of the affiliated companies  market conditions  and the industry and economic environment in which the entities operate 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of affiliated companies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
intangible assets and other long lived assets intangible assets consist of intellectual property  licenses  and capitalized software 
other long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant  and equipment 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows

to the extent a valuation allowance is established  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes and results of operations could be materially impacted
