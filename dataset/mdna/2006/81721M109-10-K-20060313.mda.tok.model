these properties are leased to five star and were managed by sunrise on december  as of december   five star operated of these properties and began operating one additional property in february sunrise does not guaranty five star s lease obligations 
the rent that five star pays to us is subordinate to the management fees paid by five star to sunrise  but our rent is not subordinate to five star s internal management costs 
the rent coverage presented for this lease has been adjusted to exclude management fees paid to sunrise for the properties that five star currently manages 
rent coverage is after non subordinated management fees on the remaining properties of million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively 
marriott guarantees the lease for the properties leased to sunrise 
independence blue cross  a pennsylvania health insurer  guarantees the lease for the properties leased to newseasons 
effective january   we entered an amended lease with healthsouth for two hospitals 
in april  we commenced a lawsuit against healthsouth seeking  among other matters  to reform the amended lease  based upon healthsouth s fraud  by increasing the rent payable to us from january  until the termination or expiration of the amended lease 
this litigation is pending at this time 
on october   we terminated the amended lease for default because healthsouth failed to deliver to us accurate and timely financial information as required by the amended lease 
on november   healthsouth brought a second lawsuit against us seeking to prevent our termination of the amended lease 
on september   the court ruled that our termination was proper 
on january   the court ordered healthsouth to cooperate with us in licensing a new tenant and to pay us the hospitals net patient revenues  after a management fee and payment of costs and expenses of operation  since october  healthsouth has filed an appeal of the court s decisions  however  healthsouth s motions for a stay of the court s decisions during the appeal have been denied by both the trial court and the appeals court 
during the pendency of these disputes  healthsouth continued to pay us at the disputed rent amount of  per month through january on february   healthsouth paid us an additional million which healthsouth represented to be an amount due from november  to december   and on february   healthsouth paid us an additional  which it represented to be an amount due from january  to january  we are reviewing healthsouth s calculations of amounts due to us and we may claim additional amounts 
in june  healthsouth filed a restated annual report on form k for the period ending december  in december  healthsouth filed late an annual report on form k for the period ending december  the financial and operating data included in these healthsouth form ks show a substantial negative net worth and a history of substantial operating losses 
to date we have been unable to obtain reliable current financial information about the operations of healthsouth or our hospitals 
accordingly  we do not know if we will be able to collect any additional amounts which the courts may determine to be owed to us by healthsouth 
brookdale guarantees the lease for the properties leased to alterra 
all tenant operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the indicated periods ending december   or the most recent prior period for which tenant operating results are available to us from our tenants 
rent coverage is calculated as operating cash flow from our tenants operations of our properties  before subordinated charges and capital expenditure reserves  divided by rent payable to us 
we have not independently verified our tenants operating data 
includes data for periods prior to our ownership of some of these properties 
during  healthsouth issued a press release stating that its historical financial information should not be relied upon 
from that time until june  healthsouth had not filed audited financial information with the sec 
in june  healthsouth filed a restated annual report on form k  or form k  for the period ending december  in december  healthsouth filed late a form k for the period ending december  the financial and operating data included in these healthsouth form ks show a substantial negative net worth and a history of substantial operating losses 
because we do not have reliable current information about the operations or financial performance of healthsouth or our hospitals  we do not show operating data for this operator

our weighted average balance outstanding and interest rate under our revolving bank facility was million and and million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation expense increased because of real estate acquisitions totaling million and the full year impact of real estate acquisitions totaling million 
general and administrative expense includes million and  of healthsouth litigation costs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  it also includes  of diligence costs incurred in connection with a failed potential acquisition 
general and administrative expense  exclusive of diligence and litigation costs  increased in by  or  as a result of property acquisitions 
during  we recognized an impairment of assets charge of million related to a property that had been closed during the year and that we are now offering for sale 
also  we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in connection with our redemption of a portion of our outstanding senior notes 
income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per share decreased because of the changes in revenues and expenses described above and an increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding that resulted from our issuance of common shares in and during the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million from the sale of three properties 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million from the sale of one property 
net income increased because of the changes that effected income from continuing operations and the gain on sale of properties

in connection with one of our acquisitions  we were assigned the rights under this mortgage note from a third party 
the mortgage note was allocated zero value at the time of the assignment 
however  in march  we sold the note to an affiliate of the note obligor for  interest and other income for the year ended december   includes  of mortgage interest income from mortgage financing we provided in february to alterra  and a net operating loss of  from a property we repossessed from a tenant which defaulted on its lease

general and administrative expense  exclusive of diligence and litigation costs  increased in by million  or  as a result of our acquisitions and for accounting and other costs incurred for the implementation of the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and related sec and nyse rules 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million from the sale of one property 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million from the sale of one property 
income from continuing operations  net income and per share amounts increased because of the factors described above and the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding after our issuance of common shares during liquidity and capital resources our operating liquidity and resources rents from our properties are our principal sources of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders 
we generally receive minimum rents monthly or quarterly from our tenants and we receive percentage rents monthly  quarterly or annually 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  debt service and distributions to shareholders 
we believe that this operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt service and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
our investment and financing liquidity and resources in order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our need or desire to pay operating expenses and distributions to our shareholders  we maintain a revolving bank credit facility with a group of commercial banks and other lenders 
in july  we amended our existing revolving bank credit facility to extend its maturity from november to november  with an extension option to november upon payment of an extension fee 
availability under the revolving bank credit facility increased from million to million  and the amended facility includes a feature under which we may expand the maximum borrowing to billion  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility are unsecured 
we may borrow  repay and reborrow funds until maturity 
no principal repayment is due until maturity 
we pay interest on borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility at libor plus a premium 
at december   the annual interest rate payable on our revolving bank credit facility was 
in may  we sold one nursing home for million 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings and for general business purposes 
we prepaid one of our mortgage obligations for million in connection with the sale of this property 
in june  we purchased four assisted living communities for million and loaned million under a mortgage line of credit which was secured by six assisted living facilities 
we funded these amounts  totaling million  with borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and cash on hand 
the borrower  five star  repaid the million mortgage in august and we used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
on october   we purchased the six properties securing the mortgage line of credit for million with borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and cash on hand 
simultaneous with our purchase  we terminated the mortgage line of credit 
during  we purchased million of improvements made to some of our properties 
we borrowed on our revolving bank credit facility and used cash on hand to fund these purchases 
in december  we issued million of our common shares in a public offering  raising net proceeds of million 
at that time  we called for redemption million of our senior unsecured notes 
we used the net proceeds from the offering to temporarily repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving bank credit facility and for general business purposes and  ultimately  in january  to redeem such notes 
at the end of december  we sold two assisted living facilities for million and the net proceeds received were included in cash at december  at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving bank credit facility 
we expect to use cash balances  borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions and expenditures related to the repair  maintenance or renovation of our properties 
on january   we redeemed the million of senior notes and paid a redemption premium of million plus accrued but unpaid interest 
we funded these amounts with a portion of the net proceeds from our december equity offering  which had been temporarily used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
when significant amounts are outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility or as the maturity dates of our revolving bank credit facility and term debts approach  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
as of december   we had billion available on an effective shelf registration statement 
an effective shelf registration statement allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
although there can be no assurance that we will complete any debt or equity offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financings  including debt or equity offerings  to finance future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations 
on january   we declared a distribution of per common share with respect to our fourth quarter results 
this distribution was paid to shareholders on february   using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
as of december   our contractual payment obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations ground lease obligations total at december   our term debt maturities were as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in in january  we redeemed million of the million of debt that matures in with a portion of the net proceeds from our december equity offering  which had been temporarily used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
as of march   we have no commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  joint ventures or partnerships 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our trust preferred securities issued by an unconsolidated subsidiary of ours 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our trust preferred securities 
debt covenants our principal debt obligations at december   were our unsecured revolving bank credit facility  two issues totaling million of unsecured senior notes  our million of junior subordinated debentures and million of mortgage debt and bonds secured by of our properties 
as discussed above  we redeemed million of our unsecured senior notes in january our senior notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving bank credit facility contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios 
our junior subordinated debentures are governed by an indenture which is generally less restrictive than the indenture governing our senior notes and the terms of our revolving bank credit facility 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and related supplements and our revolving bank credit facility 
none of our indentures and related supplements  our revolving bank credit facility or our other debt obligations contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  in certain circumstances our revolving bank credit facility uses our senior debt rating to determine the fees and the interest rate payable 
our public debt indenture and related supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of million or more 
similarly  a default on our public debt indenture or junior subordinated debentures indenture would be a default under our revolving bank credit facility 
related party transactions in  hrpt distributed a majority of our shares to its shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into a transaction agreement with hrpt pursuant to which it was agreed that so long as hrpt owns more than of our shares  we and hrpt engage the same manager  or we and hrpt have one or more common managing trustees  then we will not invest in office buildings  including medical office buildings and clinical laboratory buildings without the prior consent of hrpt s independent trustees  and hrpt will not invest in properties involving senior housing without the prior consent of our independent trustees 
if an investment involves both office and senior housing components  the character of the investment will be determined by building area  excluding common areas  unless our board and hrpt s board otherwise agree at the time 
these provisions do not apply to any investments hrpt held at the time of the spin off 
also as part of the transaction agreement  we agreed to subject our ability to waive ownership restrictions contained in our charter to the consent of hrpt s trustees so long as hrpt owns more than of our outstanding voting or equity interests 
as of march   hrpt owns of our outstanding common shares 
on december   we distributed substantially all of our shares of five star to our shareholders 
at the time five star was spun off from us  all of the persons serving as directors of five star were also our trustees 
two of our trustees  messrs 
martin and portnoy  are currently directors of five star 
as of december   we leased senior living communities to five star for total annual minimum rent of million 
all transactions between us and five star subsequent to the five star spin off have been approved by our independent trustees who are not directors of five star 
in june  we purchased from five star four assisted living communities for million  which we leased back to five star 
these communities were added to a combination lease for communities from us to five star which has a current term ending in  plus tenant renewal options thereafter 
the annual rent under the combination lease increased by million plus percentage rent starting in also in june  we provided a million first mortgage line of credit to assist five star with financing up to of the purchase price of six assisted living communities located in suburban pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
five star borrowed million on this line of credit for the june closing of its acquisition and subsequently repaid this borrowing in august on october   we purchased the six properties that secured this line of credit from five star for million  five star s purchase price for the properties  and we leased them back to five star 
simultaneous with our purchase  the line of credit was cancelled 
these properties were added to the existing combination lease described above 
the annual rent under the combination lease increased by million plus percentage rent starting in in  we sold one nursing home to five star and two assisted living facilities previously leased to five star to unaffiliated parties for total consideration of approximately million and recognized a gain of million 
these three properties were part of our combination leases with five star 
under the terms of these leases  upon the sale of the properties the annual rent payable to us was reduced by of the net proceeds we received from the sales  or approximately million 
during the year ended december   pursuant to the terms of our leases with five star  we purchased approximately million of improvements made to our properties leased by five star  and  as a result  the annual rent payable to us by five star increased by of our investments  or approximately million 
on february   we agreed to lease the two hospitals affected by the healthsouth litigation to five star  conditioned upon five star s obtaining the health regulatory approvals required to operate the hospitals 
when the new lease becomes effective  the annual rent five star will pay to us will be million per year 
in  when we believe accurate financial information based upon stabilized operations will be available and that the litigation with healthsouth may be concluded  either we or five star may request that the rent be reset effective july  in december  we completed a public offering for million of our common shares 
simultaneous with this offering  hrpt sold  of our shares which it owned 
we and hrpt were parties to a joint underwriting agreement in connection with this offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our shares by hrpt and hrpt paid its pro rata share of the expenses of this offering 
the shares sold by hrpt were offered pursuant to an effective registration statement filed by us pursuant to an agreement with hrpt 
hrpt paid the expenses of preparing and filing that registration statement 
rmr originates and presents investment opportunities to our board and provides management and administrative services to us under an agreement 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to a percentage of our average real estate investments  as defined 
the percentage applied to our investments at the time we were spun off from hrpt is 
the percentage for the first million of investments made since our spin off from hrpt is and thereafter is 
in addition rmr receives an incentive fee based upon increases in our funds from operations per share  as defined 
the incentive fee is paid in common shares 
the fees we paid rmr during for services were million 
rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services 
we pay a pro rata share of rmr s costs in providing that function 
our audit committee approves the identity and salary of the individual serving as our director of internal audit  as well as the share of the costs which we pay  in 
prior to october   rmr was beneficially owned by messrs 
barry portnoy and gerard martin  each a managing trustee and member of our board of trustees 
effective october   messrs 
barry portnoy and his son  adam portnoy  acquired mr 
martin s beneficial ownership interest in rmr 
mr 
adam portnoy is an executive officer of rmr and the executive vice president of hrpt 
mr 
martin remains a director of rmr and  together with mr 
barry portnoy  continues to serve as one of our managing trustees 
all transactions between us and rmr are approved by our independent trustees 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our three most critical accounting policies concern our investments in real property and are as follows allocation of purchase price and recognition of depreciation expense 
the acquisition cost of each real property investment is allocated to various property components such as land  buildings and improvements  and each component generally has a different useful life 
acquisition cost allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on our management s estimates or  under some circumstances  studies provided by independent real estate appraisal firms 
we allocate the value of real estate acquired among building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  the value of in place leases and the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships 
we compute related depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements and up to years for personal property 
the value of intangible assets is amortized over the term of the respective lease 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs or incorrect estimates of useful lives could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the balance sheet and income for future periods as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
impairment of assets 
we periodically evaluate our real property investments for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real property investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that property 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
classification of leases 
our real property investments are generally leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenues 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  appropriate discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties are operated 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of some of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage rents which we receive based upon a percentage of our tenants revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased operating costs at our leased properties  we generally require our tenants to guarantee our rent 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we previously have purchased interest rate cap agreements and we may enter into similar interest rate hedge arrangements in the future 
the decision to enter into these agreements was and will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and the requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
impact of government reimbursement approximately of our current annual rents come from properties where approximately or more of the operating revenues are derived from residents who pay from their own private resources 
the remaining of our rents come from properties where the revenues are heavily dependent upon medicare and medicaid programs 
the operations of these properties currently produce sufficient cash flow to support our rent 
however  as discussed above in business government regulation and reimbursement  we expect that medicare and medicaid rates paid to our tenants may not increase in amounts sufficient to pay our tenants increased operating costs  or that they may even decline 
also  the hospitals we leased to healthsouth are heavily dependent upon medicare revenues 
we cannot predict whether our tenants which are affected by medicare and medicaid rates will be able to continue to pay their rent obligations if these expected circumstances occur and persist for an extended time 
seasonality nursing home and assisted living operations have historically reflected modest seasonality 
during calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  residents at such facilities are sometimes discharged to join in family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors and others  these operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of each calendar year and lesser earnings in the fourth and first calendar quarters 
we do not expect these seasonal differences to have a material impact upon the ability of our tenants to pay our rent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the future 
at december   our outstanding fixed rate debt included the following dollars in thousands debt principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due unsecured senior notes semi annually unsecured senior notes semi annually junior subordinated debentures quarterly mortgages monthly mortgages monthly bonds semi annually in january  we redeemed million of our senior notes and paid a redemption premium of million 
no principal payments are due under our unsecured notes  debentures or bonds until maturity 
our mortgages require principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to an amortization schedule 
because these debts bear interest at a fixed rate  changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our operating results 
if these debts are refinanced at interest rates which are higher or lower than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase or decrease by approximately million 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analysis through the maturity date of our fixed rated debt obligations  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of those obligations by approximately million 
we are allowed to make prepayments of our unsecured senior notes  in whole or in part  at par plus a premium  as defined 
our debentures have provisions that allow us to make repayments at par beginning june  our mortgages contain a provision that allows us to make repayment at face value plus a premium which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the mortgage holder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity 
our unsecured revolving bank credit facility accrues interest at floating rates and matures in november at december   we had million outstanding and million available for borrowing under our revolving bank credit facility 
we may make repayments and drawings under our revolving bank credit facility at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding revolving indebtedness of million at december   was per annum 
the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at december  dollars in thousands impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving bank credit facility or other floating rate obligations
