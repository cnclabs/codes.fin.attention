item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which are based upon current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in order for us to utilize the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  investors are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors  among others  set forth below  and consequently  actual operations and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
the important factors include o our ability to renew and or maintain contracts with our customers under existing terms or restructure these contracts on terms that would not have a material negative impact on our results of operations  o our ability to execute new contracts for health plan disease management services  o the risks associated with a significant concentration of our revenues with a limited number of health plan customers  o the timing and costs of implementation  and the effect of regulatory rules and interpretations relating to the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act  o our ability to effect estimated cost savings and clinical outcome improvements under health plan disease management contracts and reach mutual agreement with customers with respect to cost savings  or to effect such savings and improvements within the timeframes contemplated by us  o the ability of our health plan customers to provide timely  complete and accurate data that is essential to the operation and measurement of our performance under the terms of our health plan contracts  and our accurate analysis of such data  o our ability to resolve favorably contract billing and interpretation issues with our health plan customers  o our ability to effectively integrate new technologies into our care management information technology platform  o our ability to obtain adequate financing to provide the capital that may be needed to support the growth of our current and future operations and financing or insurance to support our performance in these operations  o unusual and unforeseen patterns of healthcare utilization by individuals within the health plans with chronic conditions  including coronary artery disease cad  stroke  heart failure hf  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes with which we have executed disease management contracts  o the impact of the introduction of new technologies  o the ability of the health plans to maintain the number of covered lives enrolled in the plans during the terms of the agreements between the health plans and us  o our ability to attract and or retain and effectively manage the employees required to implement our agreements with health plan organizations  o the impact of future state and federal healthcare legislation and regulations on our business  o the financial health of our customers and their willingness to purchase our services  o the impact of litigation or arbitration  o our ability to accurately estimate our performance and revenue recognition under the terms of our contracts  o our ability to develop new products and deliver outcomes on those products  o our ability to implement our strategy within expected cost estimates  o general economic conditions the company will face additional risk factors in connection with the initiation of operations of qmedcare  inc these risk factors may include  but not be limited  to the following o the risks inherent in starting a new venture including the incurring of significant start up expenses  the time and number of enrollees in the special needs plans  and the ability to achieve profitable operations  o the ability to maintain certain levels of equity referred to as surplus that may be required by state regulations  o the ability to maintain the risk based capital ratio rbc ratio as defined and utilized by the national association of insurance commissioners naic to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio  o the ability to reasonably estimate appropriate medical claims reserves and related benefit expenses  o the ability to maintain regulatory compliance associated with governmental supervisory agencies including state health insurance  managed care and securities departments  which have the authority to grant  suspend and revoke licenses to transact business  regulate many aspects of the products and services offered  assess fines  penalties and or sanctions  monitor our solvency and reserve adequacy and regulate our investment activities on the basis of quality  diversification and other quantitative criteria  o the ability to be competitive  set prices and renew business as pricing and underwriting regulations by states limit the company s and other health insurers flexibility to their underwriting and rating practices  particularly for small employer groups  overview we are a provider of disease management services to health plans and to the federal government through its medicare program 
our disease management services are provided by qmed  inc and ihmc 
our services assist health plans and government organizations in managing the care  and cost of diabetes  cardiovascular conditions  including coronary artery disease cad  stroke  heart failure chf  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes 
we also  to a limited extent  manufacture and sell diagnostic medical equipment to primary care physicians 
acquisitions and recent developments qmedcare  inc in december we formed qmedcare  inc as a wholly owned subsidiary of qmed  inc this organization acts as a management company that will operate a series of specialty managed care products serving a high risk population of medicare beneficiaries 
the first of these products is being offered in south dakota  beginning january  as a special needs plan for chronically ill medicare recipients 
qmedcare inc specifically formed qmedcare dakota  llc to administer this plan for dakotacare  a large health maintenance organization in south dakota 
the special needs plan will be marketed as heartline plus and will provide exclusive health coverage for heart and stroke patients 
health e monitoring  inc in april  qmed acquired of the stock of health e monitoring  inc hem 
hem will provide weight management and health promotion programs for employer groups  health insurance plans and individual consumers interested in weight management ranging from the desire to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle to those concerned about more serious weight and health management issues 
in october  qmed  inc acquired all of the assets of disease management technologies  inc dmt 
dmt has developed a website for a weight management program that will compliment hem s existing comprehensive weight management program 
we believe this will provide the necessary tools to enhance our ability to penetrate the marketplace 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended november  the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we enter into contractual arrangements with health plans and government agencies to provide disease management services 
fees under our health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by our services during the month 
the pmpm rates usually differ between contracts due to the various types of health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare advantage 
these contracts are generally for terms of one to three years with provisions for subsequent renewal  and typically provide that all or a portion of our fees may be performance based 
performance based contracts have varying degrees of risk associated with our ability to deliver the guaranteed financial cost savings 
in most cases we guarantee a percentage reduction of disease costs compared to a prior baseline year determined by actuarial analysis and other estimates used as a basis to measure performance objectives 
the measurement of our performance against the base year information is a data intensive and time consuming process that is typically not completed until six to eight months after the end of the contract year 
we bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due based on previous months membership  which always includes the amount  if any  that may be subject to refund for retroactive member terminations and a shortfall in performance 
we adjust or defer revenue for contracts where we believe performance is short of contractual obligations  possibly resulting in a refund of fees or where fees generated may be subject to further retroactive adjustment associated with a contract or plan s decision to completely terminate its coverage in a geographic market as well as general membership changes 
for example  general terminations can be due to a member s death  member change of health plan  etc 
we recognize revenue  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
 as follows we recognize the fixed portion of our monthly fee as revenue during the period we perform the services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on indicators of performance to date in the contract year  and we recognize previously recorded deferred revenue upon final settlement of the contract measurement year 
adjustments for shortfalls in performance targets under the terms of the contracts or other factors affecting revenue recognition are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are provided and are adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
we assess our estimates by analyzing various information including but not limited to  medical claims data  prior performance under the contract and review of physician and patient participation levels 
we review these estimates periodically and make adjustments  as interim information is available 
we determine our level of performance at interim periods based on medical claims data  achievement of physician and patient participation levels  or other data supplied by the health plan 
in the event these interim performance measures indicate that performance targets are not being met or sufficient data is unavailable  fees  which could be subject to refund  are not recorded as revenue but rather are recorded as a current liability entitled contract billings in excess of revenues 
under performance based arrangements  the ability to make estimates at interim periods can be challenging due to the inherent nature of the medical claims process and the lag time associated with it 
in most cases  complete paid claims data is not available until up to six months after claims are incurred 
although interim data measurements are indicative of performance objectives  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the settlement process under a contract  which includes the settlement of any performance based fees and involves reconciliation of health care claims and clinical data  is generally not completed until after the end of the contract year 
data reconciliation differences between the company and the customer can arise due to health plan data deficiencies  omissions and or data discrepancies  for which the company negotiates with the customer until agreement is reached with respect to identified issues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from three health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from four health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
during the fiscal year ended november   approximately of disease management services were derived from two health plans that each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
the company continues to anticipate a concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers in fiscal year subsequent to november   the pacificare contract and bipa medicare demonstration project were terminated and will result in a reduction in revenue of approximately million 
impairment of intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to review intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company amortizes other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies  customer contracts  and other intangibles  on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  except for trade names which have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization 
the company reviews intangible assets not subject to amortization on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company also assesses the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if the company determines that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  the company calculates any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that acquired intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated and changes from period to period of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
period to period changes for year ended november  vs 
vs 
revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development litigation settlement income loss from operations interest expense interest income  net loss on operations of joint venture other income income loss before tax provision benefit gain on sale of tax benefit income tax provision benefit  net income loss not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal year increased approximately million or over fiscal year this increase is attributable to i an increase of approximately million of revenue related to the increase in enrollment related to contracts entered into during fiscal year  ii the recognition of approximately million of previously deferred revenue and bonuses earned under contracts with healthpartners  summacare and pacificare where performance measurements were achieved or surpassed  iii an increase in revenue of  representing a return of funds previously paid under the guarantee in connection with the settlement of its arbitration with the regence group and centre insurance  iv a reduction of revenue in fiscal year of approximately  representing an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate in connection with its settlement with the regence group  and v a reduction of  in revenue during fiscal year as a result of the reconciliation process for one of our smaller health plans 
these increases were offset by a reduction in revenue of approximately million from the termination of one disease management program  market exits and reductions in membership under existing disease management programs 
subsequent to november   the pacificare contract and bipa medicare demonstration project were terminated and will result in a reduction in revenue in fiscal of approximately million 
gross profit margins for fiscal year increased to from for fiscal year this increase is related to i an increase in revenue attributable to an increase in enrollment in contracts entered into in fiscal year while direct costs associated with the initial implementation costs on these contracts were incurred in fiscal year  the incremental costs associated with the increased enrollment in fiscal year were not as significant as the initial implementation costs incurred in fiscal year  ii an increase in revenue in fiscal year of  without a corresponding increase in costs  representing a return of funds previously paid under the guarantee in connection with the settlement of its arbitration with the regence group and centre insurance  iii a decrease in revenue in fiscal year of approximately  without a corresponding decrease in costs  which represented an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate in connection with its settlement with the regence group  iv the recognition of approximately million of revenue  without a corresponding increase in costs  related to the recognition of previously deferred revenue and bonuses earned under contracts with healthpartners  summacare and pacificare where performance measurements were achieved or surpassed  and v approximately million in labor and related cost reductions associated with efficiencies related to enhancements in our programs 
the increase in gross profit margins was offset by an increase of approximately  related to the outsourcing of certain call center services and  in equipment costs for our disease management programs 
we expect a significant reduction in gross profits in fiscal year as a result of the reduction in revenue related to the termination of contracts and the increase in costs of sales as a result of the share based payments required to be expensed under sfas no 
r  shared based payment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by approximately million or over fiscal year the increase was attributable to i an increase of approximately  in salaries and related expenses primarily related to two new executives for qmedcare  inc and health e monitoring  inc and additional new hires throughout the company  ii an increase of approximately  in travel expenses primarily related to business development for qmedcare  inc and health e monitoring  inc 
ii a  increase in consulting services  iii a  increase in advertising in connection with our snp project in south dakota  iv a  increase in costs associated with trade shows during fiscal year  v a  increase in depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to the intangibles associated with the acquisition of health e monitoring  inc in the second quarter of fiscal year and disease management technologies  inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and an increase in amortization of product software development  and vi a  increase in accounting and legal fees for compliance services 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately  in commissions related to new contracts with health plans entered into in fiscal year and a decrease in insurance costs of  included within selling  general and administrative expenses outlined above was approximately million of costs incurred as implementation costs of qmedcare inc relating to the snp project in south dakota and approximately  of costs were incurred as implementation costs of health e monitoring inc we expect to continue to incur implementation costs for both qmed care inc and health e monitoring inc in fiscal year and anticipate these costs to increase during this time period 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased approximately  or over fiscal year our accounting policies are to capitalize certain software development costs during development and amortize them upon implementation 
subsequent to implementation any further costs ie maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we completed the primary development of one of our new systems and therefore all subsequent costs are being expensed  which accounts for a portion of the increase in research and development expense 
in addition  we incurred expenses in connection with the development of the health e monitoring  inc web based wellness program 
we continue to focus our efforts on the development of new advanced software programs  web based applications  and tools to assist in the identification and evaluation of patients who are at risk for developing various disease conditions 
these programs incorporate state of the art telecommunications  data management  and security and information technology 
certain costs associated with the development of new product software to be incorporated into our disease management programs are capitalized and amortized over a year useful life 
we intend to continue to improve and expand the capabilities of all of our technologies 
interest income for fiscal year was approximately  as compared to approximately  for fiscal year this increase is attributable to the investment of the funds that were primarily generated by the private placements in the first six months of fiscal year along with the cash generated from operations throughout fiscal year loss on operations of joint ventures for fiscal year increased approximately  over fiscal year the expense for fiscal year primarily represents legal fees for the arbitration and settlement with the regence group and centre insurance  and costs related to a joint venture entered into with two partners to provide services under a disease management contract in minnesota 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year is 
the difference in the company s effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax assets and the sale of certain state tax benefits 
current period income tax expense represents federal and state tax liabilities attributable to the reported net income 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal increased approximately million or over the fiscal this increase consists of approximately million of additional revenue related to the execution of new contracts entered into during fiscal this increase was offset by a reduction in revenue of approximately million representing i approximately million related to market exits and reductions in membership under existing disease management programs  the termination of disease management programs under agreements with the regence group and with a customer in oregon and ii a reduction of approximately  related to an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate related to its settlement with the regence group and  related to an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate from a contract with a customer in oregon 
gross profit margins for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to i a reduction of approximately  related to an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate related to its settlement with the regence group  ii  related to an increase in management s deferred revenue estimate with a customer in oregon and iii implementation costs associated with our expansion into new market places related to new contracts  including costs associated with one contract totaling approximately  salaries  travel and other direct costs are all factors in the initial implementation related to any new markets and contracts 
these direct costs as a percentage of revenue will decrease once a marketplace and contract matures and a significant number of members are enrolled 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased approximately  or compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to costs associated with compliance with the provisions under the sarbanes oxley act  of approximately  costs associated with negotiating and signing new disease management services contracts of approximately  and an increase in both executive and administrative staff of approximately  these increases were partially offset by the reduction of costs associated with the end of a lease on old corporate office space of approximately  and a reduction in insurance costs of approximately research and development expenses for fiscal were flat compared to fiscal we continued to focus our efforts on the development of new  advanced software programs to assist in the identification and evaluation of patients who are at risk for developing various disease conditions 
these programs incorporate state of the art telecommunications  data management  and security and information technology 
certain costs associated with the development of new product software to be incorporated into our disease management programs are capitalized and amortized over a year useful life 
we intend to continue to improve and expand the capabilities of the ohms cvd system 
loss on operations of joint ventures for fiscal increased to approximately  from  in the expense in primarily represents legal fees associated with the arbitration with the regence group and startup costs related to a joint venture entered into with two partners to provide services under a disease management contract in minnesota 
loss on operations of joint venture for fiscal primarily represented legal fees associated with the arbitration with the regence group 
there was no cost of litigation settlements in in  the litigation settlement expense of  represents costs associated with settlement of certain outstanding legal proceedings  which have either reached settlement during the period or have reached a point at which the outcome can be reasonably estimated 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was a negative 
the difference in the company s effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate was primarily due to a valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax assets and the sale of certain state tax benefits 
current period income tax expense of  represented minimum state tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our principal sources of working capital have been the proceeds from public and private placements of securities 
since our inception  sales of securities  including the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  have generated approximately  less applicable expenses 
we had working capital of approximately million at november  compared to approximately million at november  and ratios of current assets to current liabilities of as of november  and as of november  the working capital increase of approximately million was due to two private placement equity transactions during the first half of fiscal year whereby the company sold common stock for approximately million net of expenses  proceeds from the sale of common stock through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of approximately million  and cash flow from operations of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a cash payment for the purchase of health e monitoring  inc of million  a cash payment for the purchase of the assets of disease management technologies  inc of million  funding of joint ventures of approximately million  payments under capital leases of million  and other capital expenditures of million 
in september  we entered into a  line of credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association 
the agreement is collateralized by securities owned by the company and expires on september  outstanding balances under the loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lower of the bank s reference rate minus or libor plus 
as of november   no debt was outstanding and the entire  was available under this credit line 
in december  the company established a  letter of credit with wachovia bank  na to establish the appropriate capital required for the company s captive insurance company in south carolina 
in fiscal year  we anticipate that we will expend cash to fund our current operations  fund our continuing implementation costs associated with our managed care and wellness segments  and for establishing and maintaining certain levels of capital reserves as required by regulatory agencies in connection with the operations of our insurance subsidiary 
although we expect to incur these expenditures  we believe that our cash and investments  and availability under our credit line will be sufficient to fund our current level of growth and our existing and anticipated commitments 
however  to the extent the expansion of our operations requires significant additional resources or certain other forms of financial guarantees  we may be required to seek additional financing 
no assurance can be given that such financing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us 
material commitments the following schedule summarizes our contractual cost obligations as of november  in the periods indicated 
payments due by period contractual after obligations total less than year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations    operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligations employment agreements    total contractual cash obligations     risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this md a or elsewhere in the form k 
these risks and other factors may affect forward looking statements including those in this md a or made by the company elsewhere  such as in investor calls or conference presentations 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into an actual event  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline materially 
future operating results 
future operating results  which reflect management s current expectations may be impacted by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated herein 
these factors include worldwide economic and political conditions  terrorist activities  industry specific factors  and regulatory change 
new business segment special needs plans we have entered a new business segment as the administrator for a medicare advantage coordinated care special needs plan for dakotacare  a large health maintenance organization in south dakota 
the special needs plan will be marketed as heartline plus and will provide exclusive health coverage for heart and stroke patients 
our company will be faced with all of the risks of establishing a new business  including significant start up costs  uncertainty as to the timing and number of enrollees in the plan  effectively managing health care costs  and ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are dependent on the timing of contracts signed  and programs implemented during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in addition  a portion of our operating expenses is fixed in nature due to our revenue  research and development costs  to the extent that projected revenue does not meet forecast  these fixed cost would impact profitability 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems  problems with the redesign and implementation of these new systems could interfere with our operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to enhance our current infrastructure in order to improve operating efficiency and expand the range of disease management services we offer 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
as part of this effort  we are implementing software applications to manage our business operations 
failure to smoothly and successfully convert to this and or other systems could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run the business 
in addition  any failure or significant downtime in our new information systems could prevent us from efficiently implementing disease management programs  reconciling cost savings timely and accurately  and could harm our business 
if we do not introduce successful new disease management services in a timely manner  our services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
our services are for industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to o properly identify customer needs  o innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  o successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  o differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  o price our services competitively  and o anticipate our competitors announcements of new products  services  or technological innovations 
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive  and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past year  and our attrition rate has dropped  there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team  and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity would depend on a variety of factors  including o the retention of key employees  o the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  o the retention of key customers  and o the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing  and sales programs and facilities all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
if we do not realize the expected benefits from such transactions  our financial position results and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to curtail operations  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant federal  state  and local health and safety  health information disclosure  and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently  and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations  or portions of our operations  or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
litigation regarding patents or intellectual property could be costly and time consuming 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a meaningful competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
we depend on payments from cms and health plans  and cost reductions within those entities may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the healthcare industry in which we operate is currently subject to significant cost reduction pressures as a result of constrained revenues from governmental and private sources as well as from the increasing underlying cost of medical care 
we believe that these pressures will continue and possibly intensify 
while we believe that our services are geared specifically to assist health plans and governmental agencies in controlling the high costs associated with the treatment of chronic diseases  the pressures to reduce costs immediately may have a negative effect  in certain circumstances  on the ability of or the length of time required for us to sign new contracts 
in addition  this focus on cost reduction may result in increased focus from health plans on contract restructurings that reduce the fees paid to us for our services 
there can be no assurance that these financial pressures will not have a negative impact on our operations 
compliance with new federal and state legislation and regulation could adversely affect our results of operations or may require us to invest substantial amounts acquiring and implementing new information systems and or modifying existing systems 
health plans and employers are subject to considerable state and federal government regulation 
many of these regulations are vaguely written and subject to differing interpretations that may  in certain cases  result in unintended consequences that may impact our ability to effectively deliver our services 
the focus on regulatory and legislative efforts to protect the confidentiality of patient identifiable medical information  as evidenced by the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  is one such example 
we believe that our ability to obtain from health plans and cms patient identifiable medical information for disease management purposes is protected in federal regulations governing medical record confidentiality 
state legislation or regulation of this information may be more restrictive 
we are continually determining the extent to which specific state legislation or regulations govern our health plan operations 
new federal or state legislation or regulation in this area  which prohibitively restricts the availability of certain critical information to us  would have a material negative impact on our disease management operations 
the disease management industry is a relatively new segment of the health care industry and  as a result  experiences a lengthy sales cycle for new contracts 
the disease management industry  which is growing rapidly  is a relatively new segment of the overall healthcare industry and has many entrants marketing various services and products labeled as disease management 
the generic label of disease management has been utilized to characterize a wide range of activities from the sale of medical supplies and drugs to services aimed at disease management 
because the industry is relatively new  health plan purchasers of these services have not had significant experience purchasing  evaluating or monitoring such services  this generally results in a lengthy sales cycle for new health plan contracts 
in addition  with the reduction in revenue of million resulting from the termination of the pacificare contract and bipa medicare demonstration project  we continue to anticipate a concentration of revenues in fiscal resulting from a limited number of customers 
until we sign and implement additional health plan contracts  the loss or a downward restructuring of a contract would negatively and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
the disease management industry depends on effectively using information systems and the failure of these systems could adversely affect our business 
the disease management industry is dependent on the effective use of information technology 
while we believe that our state of the art technology provides us with a competitive advantage in the industry  we expect to continually invest in updating and expanding this technology and  in some cases  will be required to make systems investments in advance of the generation of revenues from contracts 
in addition  these system requirements expose us to technology obsolescence risks 
accordingly  we amortize our computer software and hardware over three to five years 
we depend on the timely receipt of accurate data from our health plan customers and our accurate analysis of this data 
the measurement of our performance under our health plan contracts is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of accurate data from our health plan customers and the accuracy of the analysis of such data 
data acquisition  data quality control  and data analysis are intense and complex processes subject to error 
untimely  incomplete or inaccurate data from a customer or flawed analysis of such data could have a material adverse impact on our revenues from that contract 
our revenue is subject to seasonal pressure resulting from the disenrollment process of our health plan clients 
the membership enrollment and disenrollment processes of our health plan customers can result in a cyclical reduction of lives under management  especially during our first quarter 
employers typically make decisions about health insurance carriers at the end of each calendar year 
health plans also periodically assess the types of markets they service as well as the contractual arrangements of medical groups within those markets 
in any event  all of these factors will have an effect on membership as of january of each year 
a health plan s decision to exit markets or non renewal of contracts with its medical groups will result in a loss of covered lives under management as of january although these decisions may also result in a gain of members  the process of identification and enrollment will typically lag by six months or longer 
the result of these cyclical changes has not  to date  had a material impact on the company s revenues or results of operations but could have such an effect in the future 
a potential seasonal impact on covered membership could be caused by a decision by a health plan to withdraw or expand coverage thereby automatically disenrolling previously covered members or enrolling new members  and or would significant shifts in employer s participation in the plans 
contract renewals the disease management industry is relatively new  as such the renewal experience for these contracts is limited 
no assurances can be given that results from contract restructurings and possible terminations at or prior to renewal would not have a material negative impact on our operations and financial condition 
share prices of healthcare companies and our share price in particular may be volatile 
the volatility may be influenced by the market s perceptions of the healthcare sector in general  or of other companies believed to be similar to us or by the market s perception of our operations and future prospects 
many of these perceptions are beyond our control 
health care regulation general the federal and state governments have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways 
these laws and regulations restrict how we conduct our business and result in additional burdens and costs to us 
areas of governmental regulation include o licensure o policy forms  including plan design and disclosures o premium rates and rating methodologies o underwriting rules and procedures o benefit mandates o eligibility requirements o service areas o market conduct o utilization review activities o payment of claims  including timeliness and accuracy of payment o member rights and responsibilities o sales and marketing activities o quality assurance procedures o disclosure of medical and other information o provider rates of payment o surcharges on provider payments o provider contract forms o delegation of risk and other financial arrangements o producer licensing and compensation o financial condition including reserves and o corporate governance these laws and regulations are different in each jurisdiction 
states generally require health insurers and hmos to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations 
to establish a new insurance company or an hmo in a state  we generally would have to obtain such a certificate 
the time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from state to state 
each health insurer and hmo must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business 
in addition  health insurers and hmos are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal 
legislative and regulatory initiatives there has been a continuing trend of increased health care regulation at both the federal and state levels 
the federal government and many states have enacted or are considering additional legislation or regulation related to health care plans 
legislation  regulation  and initiatives relating to this trend include among other things  the following o amending or supplementing erisa to impose greater requirements on the administration of employer funded benefit plans or limit to the scope of current erisa pre emption  which would among other things expose health plans to expanded liability for punitive and other extra contractual damages 
o imposing assessments on or to be collected by health plans or health carriers  such as assessments for insolvency  assessments for uninsured or high risk pools  assessments for uncompensated care  or assessments to defray provider medical malpractice insurance costs 
o extending malpractice and other liability exposure for decisions made by health plans 
o mandating coverage for certain conditions and or specified procedures  drugs  or devices eg infertility treatment  experimental pharmaceuticals 
o mandating direct access to specialists for patients with chronic conditions  and direct access to ob gyns  chiropractors  or other practitioners 
o mandating expanded employer and consumer disclosures and notices 
o mandating expanded coverage for emergency services 
o prohibiting or limiting certain types of financial arrangements with providers including  among other things  incentives based on utilization of services or various other performance metrics 
o imposing substantial penalties for failure to pay claims within specified time periods 
o regulating the composition of provider networks  as occurs with willing provider and pharmacy laws which generally provide that providers and pharmacies cannot be denied participation in a managed care plan where the providers and pharmacies are willing to abide by the terms and conditions of that plan 
o imposing a fee schedule for out of network care 
o exempting physicians from the antitrust laws that prohibit price fixing  group boycotts  and other horizontal restraints on competition 
o restricting health plan claim and related procedures 
o requiring the application of treatment and financial parity between mental health benefits and medical benefits within the same health plan 
o extending benefits available to workers who lose their jobs and others who are uninsured 
o mandating liberalized definitions of medical necessity 
o mandating internal and external grievance and appeal procedures including expedited decision making and access to external claim review 
o enabling the creation of new types of health plans or health carriers  which in some instances would not be subject to the regulations or restrictions that govern our operations 
o allowing individuals and small groups to collectively purchase health care coverage without any other affiliations 
o imposing requirements and restrictions on operations of pharmacy benefit managers  including restricting or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs 
o making health plans responsible for provider payments in the event of financial failure by a capitated physician group or other intermediary 
o creating or expanding state sponsored health benefit purchasing pools  in which we might be required to participate 
o creating a single payer system where the government oversees or manages the provision of health care coverage 
o imposing employer or individual health coverage mandates 
it is uncertain whether we can counter the potential adverse effects of such potential legislation or regulation  including whether we can recoup  through higher premiums or other measures  the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs due to regulatory change 
we also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or impose medical malpractice or bad faith liability 
among other issues  the courts  including the us supreme court and federal and state courts  continue to consider cases addressing the pre emptive effect of erisa on state laws 
in general  limitations to this pre emption have the effect of increasing our costs  liability exposures  or both 
legislative initiatives discussed above include proposals in the us congress to restrict the pre emptive effect of erisa and legislative activity in several states that  should it result in enacted legislation that is not preempted by erisa  could increase our liability exposure and could result in greater state regulation of our operations 
patients rights legislation various state legislatures and the us congress continue to debate legislation containing various patient protection initiatives  including provisions that could expose the company to unlimited economic damages and certain punitive damages  for making a determination denying benefits or for delaying members receipt of benefits as a result of medical necessity or other coverage determinations 
the company cannot predict whether these measures will be enacted into law in or what form any such legislation might take 
erisa the provision of services to certain employee benefit plans including certain health care  group insurance and large case pensions benefit plans  is subject to erisa  a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the internal revenue service and the department of labor the dol 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
dol regulations under erisa set standards for claim payment and member appeals along with associated notice and disclosure requirements 
we have invested significant time and attention to compliance with these new standards  which represent an additional regulatory burden for us 
we face a wide range of risks  and our success depends on our ability to identify  prioritize and appropriately manage our enterprise risk exposures 
operating in a complex industry  we expect to encounter a variety of risks 
the risks we face include  among other matters  the range of industry  competitive  regulatory  operational or external risks identified in this risk factor discussion 
failure to appropriately identify  manage and or mitigate these risks can affect our profitability  our ability to retain or grow business  or  in the event of extreme circumstances  our financial condition or viability 
our ability to forecast and manage health care costs affects profitability 
in the special needs plan business segment  profitability depends in large part on accurately forecasting health care costs and on our ability to appropriately manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs 
the aging of the population and other demographic characteristics  and advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising health care costs 
government imposed limitations on medicare and medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs 
changes in health care practices  inflation  new technologies  the cost of prescription drugs and direct to consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies  adverse selection  changes in the regulatory environment  health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care are beyond any health plan s control and may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the profitability of our business will depend on our ability to effectively manage health care costs for our chronically ill members 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
although we believe our disease management expertise will allow us to control costs effectively  inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed estimates 
these factors include  but are not limited to  increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments  technology  new mandate benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
in addition  since we are just entering this managed care segment and are likely to have a low enrollment base in the early stages  we are potentially at financial risk from individuals who may incur abnormally high medical costs 
since a large portion of the premiums go to medical costs  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs can result in significant changes in our financial results 
there can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of medical cost projections assumed for pricing purposes and if the rate of increase in medical costs in were to exceed the levels of medicare reimbursement  our results would be materially adversely affected 
we expect that management will need to focus simultaneously on multiple strategic and operational initiatives as we seek to further improve our financial performance  profitably grow our business  and differentiate our products and services  if we do not successfully implement these initiatives  or if these initiatives do not achieve their objectives  our results could be materially adversely affected 
our operating earnings have significantly improved over the last year  however  in our next phase of development management will need to continue to focus on executing multiple strategic and operational projects and initiatives at the same time  including  among other things  new customer market approach  further improving the efficiency of operations  certain significant technology projects  further improving relations with health care providers  customer or provider contracting changes  or other business process improvements 
the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to design and implement these initiatives 
if these initiatives do not achieve their objectives or result in increased medical costs  our results could be adversely affected 
refer to overview for more information 
we would be adversely affected if there were a significant loss or significant shift in the type of our qmedcare insurance initiatives 
failure to achieve profitable membership growth in our qmedcare insurance initiatives could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
terrorism or the continued threat of terrorism  epidemics or other extreme events could materially increase health care utilization and pharmacy costs and group insurance life and disability claims  although we cannot predict whether any such increases will occur 
terrorism can affect the us economy in general  but also the healthcare industry and qmed specifically 
beyond obtaining coverage for our facilities  there are few  if any  commercial options through which to transfer the exposure from terrorism away from the company 
in particular  in the event of bioterrorism epidemics or other extreme events  we could face significant health care costs depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurers 
success of our business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology  certain significant multiyear strategic information technology projects are currently in process 
we need to continue to improve our systems to meet current standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards  and customer demands 
our success is dependent in large part on maintaining the effectiveness of existing systems  on implementing improvements  and on continuing to develop and enhance information systems that support our business processes in a cost efficient manner 
in the future  we expect to hold reserves for expected claims  which are estimated 
these estimates are highly judgmental  if actual claims exceed reserve estimates our results could be materially adversely affected 
reserves will be established to reflect estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet paid 
these reserves will be estimated periodically  and any resulting adjustments will be reflected in current period operating results 
these reserves will be based on a number of factors  including those derived from actuarial assumptions and analysis 
we expect that a large portion of health care claims will typically not be submitted until after the end of the quarter in which services are rendered by providers to members 
as a result  subject matter knowledge is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the adequacy of the estimate is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends the rate of increase in medical costs 
a worsening or improvement of medical cost trend or changes in claim payment patterns from assumptions used to estimate the reserves would cause such estimates to change in the near term  and such a change could be material 
our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with providers on favorable terms and otherwise maintain favorable provider relationships 
our profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals  physicians and other health benefits providers 
this ability to contract is affected both by the rates for provider services  and by our provider payment and other provider relations practices 
the sufficiency and quality of our networks of available providers is also an important factor when customers consider our products and services 
the failure to maintain or to secure new cost effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss in membership and or higher medical costs 
we must demonstrate that our products and processes facilitates access by members to quality care delivered by their providers 
failure to demonstrate that our products and processes such as disease management programs  provider credentialing and other quality of care and information management initiatives facilitate access by members to quality care by providers would adversely affect our ability to differ entiate our product and or service offerings from those of competitors 
we outsource and obtain certain information technology systems or other services from independent third parties 
although we will take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of independent third parties who provide services to us or to whom we delegate selected functions  these arrangements may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us  whether because of our failure to adequately monitor and regulate their performance  changes in their own financial condition  or other matters outside our control 
certain legislative authorities have  in recent periods also discussed or proposed legislation that would restrict outsourcing and  if enacted  could materially increase our costs 
government payors can determine premiums 
in our government funded health programs such as our snp project with dakotacare in south dakota  medicare  the government payor determines the premium levels 
if the government payor reduces the premium levels or increases premiums by less than our costs of service increase  and if we cannot offset these with supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  then we could be materially adversely affected 
our future business activities will be highly regulated  further regulation could also materially adversely affect our business 
our future business will be subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state and federal governmental authorities 
the federal and many state governments have enacted and continue to consider legislative and regulatory changes related to health products 
at this time  we are unable to predict the impact of future changes  although we anticipate that some of these measures  if enacted  could adversely affect health operations through o affecting premium rates  o reducing our ability to manage medical costs  o increasing medical costs and operating expenses  o increasing our exposure to lawsuits  o regulating levels and permitted lines of business  o imposing financial assessments  and o regulating business practices 
recently  there has been heightened review by regulators of the health care insurance industry s business practices  these include utilization management and claim payment practices as well as review of the general insurance industry s brokerage practices 
these regulatory reviews could result in changes to or clarifications of our business practices  and also could result in material fines  penalties  or other sanctions 
our business also may be adversely impacted by judicial and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations  impose medical or bad faith liability  increase our responsibilities under erisa  or reduce the scope of erisa pre emption of state law claims 
we also face other risks that could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  which include any requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles  financial loss from inadequate insurance coverage due to self insurance levels or unavailability of coverage for credit or other reasons  o failure of our processes to prevent and detect unethical conduct of employees  o a significant failure of internal controls over financial reporting  o failure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies  o provider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self insured customers  and o failure of corporate governance policies and procedures 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements
