cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  decreased in as compared to this decrease is primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin products shipped  in conjunction with the impact of raw material surcharges and base price increases  implemented over the past two years  which more than offset higher raw material  labor  energy and other manufacturing supply costs 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employment costs related to the continued growth of the business in  higher property taxes and the write off of a building held for sale  which were partially offset by a reduction in the bad debt provision 
under a previous lease agreement  the company was responsible to reimburse aks for a portion of the property taxes assessed against the bridgeville facility 
in june  the company received an invoice for prior year property taxes that required the company to record an additional expense of  attempts to sell the dunkirk office building since february have not been successful  and the company had no prospective buyers 
the change in circumstances caused the company s management to write off the  carrying value of the dunkirk office building

interest expense and other financing costs increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily due to a million increase in the average balance of the revolving line of credit over the prior year  coupled with increasing the term loan by million in june other income  net is primarily attributed to the receipt of funds under the cdsoa

the company s business conditions were enhanced by the relatively weak us dollar 
cost of products sold  as a percent of net sales  decreased in as compared to this decrease is primarily due to the impact of raw material surcharge and base price increases implemented in  as well as higher production volumes  more than offsetting higher raw material  labor  energy and other manufacturing costs 
in addition  dunkirk specialty steel generated sufficient production volumes and implemented other cost reduction initiatives to operate profitably in selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employment costs and a  increase in bad debt expense 
a substantial portion of the bad debt expense is related to one customer who filed for chapter bankruptcy protection and to a second financially distressed customer s inability to pay its outstanding receivable balance at december  interest expense and other financing costs increased from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to the company funding the increase in working capital to support higher production volumes with a revolving line of credit

the remaining payment  as well as the award of  was received and recognized as income in  net of expenses incurred 
the effective income tax rate was compared to a income tax benefit in the change in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to the impact of recognizing a loss in against the tax credit benefits generated by the company from operating dunkirk specialty steel within a new york state empire zone

at december   working capital approximated million  as compared to million at december  and million at december  accounts receivable represents million and million of the and increases in comparison to the prior year  which relates to the growth in net sales 
inventory  net of non debt current liabilities  increased million and million in and  respectively  in comparison to the prior year  primarily due to increased production volumes of higher margin products requiring longer production cycles and increased raw material costs incurred during the year 
the cost of raw materials contained within work in process inventory is approximately million higher at december   as compared to december   and million higher at december   as compared to december   as a result of increased raw material transaction prices 
the company continuously monitors market price fluctuations of its key raw materials 
the following table reflects the average market values per pound for selected months during the last three year period 
december june december june december june nickel chrome molybdenum carbon scrap increased demand from foreign primarily china and domestic sources caused raw material market values to rise significantly since june in response  the company began to calculate its nickel surcharge using an per pound premium over the london metal exchange lme prices on february   implemented an iron surcharge component on february   expanded the use of surcharges to include tool steel products on may  and implemented a manganese surcharge component on june  the nickel surcharge premium per pound was increased from to on august  in addition  the company has experienced higher energy  transportation and manufacturing supply costs during and in response  the company has announced several sales price increases during the past two years as well as implemented a natural gas surcharge component on october  there can be no assurance that these sales price increases will completely offset the company s rising costs

revenue from the sale of products is recognized when both risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer  which in most cases coincides with shipment of the related products  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company manufactures specialty steel product to customer purchase order specifications and in recognition of requirements for product acceptance 
material certification forms are executed  indicating compliance with the customer purchase orders  before the specialty steel products are packed and shipped to the customer 
occasionally customers request that the packed products be held at the company s facility beyond the stated shipment date 
in these situations  the company receives written confirmation of the request  acknowledgement that title has passed to the customer and that normal payment terms apply 
such amounts included in revenue for the years ended december   and were less than of net sales 
revenue from conversion services is recognized when the performance of the service is complete
