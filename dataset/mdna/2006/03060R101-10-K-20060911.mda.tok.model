item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading independent auto finance company specializing in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles and  to a lesser extent  making auto loans directly to consumers 
we generate revenue and cash flows primarily through the purchase  retention  subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables 
as used herein  loans include auto finance receivables originated by dealers and purchased by us as well as direct extensions of credit made by us to consumer borrowers 
to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization and to fund the repurchase of receivables pursuant to cleanup call options  we use available cash and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we earn finance charge income on the finance receivables and pay interest expense on borrowings under our credit facilities 
we  through wholly owned subsidiaries  periodically transfer receivables to securitization trusts trusts that issue one or more asset backed securities 
the asset backed securities are  in turn  sold to investors 
we retain an interest in these securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization  whereby more receivables are transferred to the trusts than the amount of asset backed securities issued by the trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received over the life of the securitization 
excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset backed securities  net of credit losses and expenses 
excess cash flows from the trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
once predetermined credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash flows are distributed to us 
credit enhancement requirements will increase if targeted portfolio performance ratios are exceeded 
in addition to excess cash flows  we receive monthly base servicing fees and we collect other fees  such as late charges  as servicer for securitization trusts 
we changed the structure of our securitization transactions beginning with transactions closed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables and the related securitization notes payable remain on the consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize finance charge and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization transaction  and record a provision for loan losses to cover probable loan losses on the receivables 
this change has significantly impacted our reported results of operations compared to historical results because there is no gain on sale of receivables subsequent to september  prior to october   these securitization transactions were structured as sales of finance receivables 
receivables sold under this structure are referred to herein as gain on sale receivables 
at june   approximately of our managed receivables were gain on sale receivables 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material 
the accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established systematically based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
we review charge off experience 
table of contents factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic trends  such as unemployment rates  and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the probable credit losses 
we also use historical charge off experience to determine a loss confirmation period  which is defined as the time between when an event  such as delinquency status  giving rise to a probable credit loss occurs with respect to a specific account and when such account is charged off 
this loss confirmation period is applied to the forecasted probable credit losses to determine the amount of losses inherent in finance receivables at the reporting date 
assumptions regarding credit losses and loss confirmation periods are reviewed periodically and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumption or loss confirmation period increase  there would be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which would decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the amount of provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
a and increase in cumulative net credit losses over the loss confirmation period would increase the allowance for loan losses as of june   as follows in thousands adverse change adverse change impact on allowance for loan losses we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in our receivables  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase 
credit enhancement assets our credit enhancement assets  which represent retained interests in securitization trusts accounted for as sales  are recorded at fair value 
because market prices are not readily available for the credit enhancement assets  fair value is determined using discounted cash flow models 
the most significant assumptions made are the cumulative net credit losses to be incurred on the pool of receivables sold  the timing of those losses and the rate at which estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
the assumptions used represent our best estimates 
the assumptions may change in future periods due to changes in the economy that may impact the performance of our finance receivables and the risk profiles of our credit enhancement assets 
the use of different assumptions would result in different carrying values for our credit enhancement assets and may change the amount of accretion of present value discount and impairment of credit enhancement assets recognized through the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
an immediate and adverse change in the assumptions used to measure the fair value of credit enhancement assets would not have a material effect as of june  stock based employee compensation effective july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  revised sfas r  prospectively for all awards granted  modified or settled after june  we adopted the standard by using the modified prospective method that is one of the adoption methods provided for under sfas r 
sfas r  which revised fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be measured at fair value and recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  on july   we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which the securities and exchange commission issued in march to provide its view on the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
for the years ended june    and  we have recorded total stock based compensation expense of million million net of tax  million million net of tax and million million net of tax  respectively 
included in total stock based compensation expense for the year ended june   is an additional million  as a result of adoption of sfas r and sab for amortization of outstanding options that vest subsequent to june   and were granted prior to our implementation of sfas on 
table of contents july  the remaining estimated pretax amortization is less than million on these outstanding options at june  the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the years ended june  and  have not been restated to reflect the amortization of these options 
the fair value of each option granted or modified was estimated using an option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions year ended june  expected dividends expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years years years we have not paid out dividends historically  thus the dividend yields are estimated at zero percent 
effective july   we changed our assumption for determining expected volatility on all new options granted after that date to reflect an average of the implied and historical volatility rates 
after giving consideration to recently available regulatory guidance  management believes that a combination of market based measures is currently the best available indicator of expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected lives of options are determined based on our historical option exercise experience and the term of the option 
assumptions are reviewed each time there is a new grant or modification of a previous grant and may be impacted by actual fluctuation in our stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions produces a different fair value for the options granted or modified and impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the impact of a or increase in our assumptions of volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life on the amount of compensation expense recognized would not have been material for the years ended june   and income taxes we are subject to income tax in the united states and canada 
in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions  calculations  structures and filing positions where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
at any point in time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions and we record probable liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  penalties  and interest may be due 
management believes that the estimates are reasonable 
however  due to expiring statutes of limitations  audits  settlements  changes in tax law or new authoritative rulings  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be comparable to what was reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust these assumptions in the future  we may need to adjust our deferred tax assets or liabilities which could materially impact the effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash 
as a part of our financial reporting process  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated to be unrecoverable 
in this process  certain criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses  credit carrybacks  
table of contents and estimated taxable income in future years 
based upon our earnings history and earnings projections  management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the asset will be fully realized 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been provided on deferred taxes 
our judgment regarding future taxable income may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require adjustments to these deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period in which such determinations are made 
results of operations year ended june  as compared to year ended june  changes in finance receivables a summary of changes in our finance receivables is as follows in thousands years ended june  balance at beginning of period loans purchased loans repurchased from gain on sale trusts bvac acquisition liquidations and other balance at end of period average finance receivables the increase in loans purchased during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the addition of dealer relationship managers and branch office staff resulting in relationships with more auto dealers and higher origination levels through existing auto dealer relationships 
the increase in liquidations and other resulted primarily from increased collections and charge offs on finance receivables due to the increase in average finance receivables and average age  or seasoning  of the portfolio 
the average new loan size was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the average annual percentage rate for finance receivables purchased during fiscal increased to from during fiscal due to an increase in new loan pricing as a result of an increase in short term market interest rates

the effective yield on our finance receivables increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the effective yield represents finance charges and fees taken into earnings during the period as a percentage of average finance receivables and is lower than the contractual rates of our auto finance contracts due to finance receivables in nonaccrual status 
the increase in the effective yield is primarily due to an increase in the average annual percentage rate on our finance receivables as well as the accretion of acquisition fees on loans acquired subsequent to june   due to our adoption of statement of position  accounting for certain loans on debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
servicing income consists of the following in thousands years ended june  servicing fees other than temporary impairment accretion average gain on sale receivables servicing fees are earned from servicing domestic finance receivables sold to gain on sale trusts

servicing fees were and of average gain on sale receivables for fiscal and  respectively 
other than temporary impairment of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  resulted from higher than forecasted default rates in certain gain on sale trusts 
the present value discount related to our credit enhancement assets represents the risk adjusted time value of money on estimated cash flows 
the present value discount on credit enhancement assets is accreted into earnings over the life of credit enhancement assets using the effective interest method 
additionally  unrealized gains on credit enhancement assets reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income are also accreted into earnings over the life of the credit enhancement assets using the effective interest method 
we recognized accretion of million  or of average credit enhancement assets  and million  or of average credit enhancement assets  during fiscal and  respectively 
we reduce accretion of the present value discount in a period when such accretion would cause an other than temporary impairment in a securitization trust 
accretion is reduced on the securitization trust and an other than temporary impairment is recorded in an amount equal to the amount by which the reference amount exceeds the revised value of the related credit enhancement assets 
future period accretion is subsequently recognized based upon the revised value and 
table of contents recorded over the remaining expected life of the securitization trust 
accretion as a percentage of average credit enhancement assets was higher during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of fewer securitization transactions incurring other than temporary impairments 
other income consists of the following in thousands years ended june  investment income gain on sale of equity investment loss on redemption of senior notes late fees and other income investment income increased as a result of higher invested cash balances combined with increased market interest rates 
we hold an equity investment in dealertrack  a leading provider of on demand software and data solutions that utilizes the internet to link automotive dealers with banks  finance companies  credit unions and other financing sources 
on december   dealertrack completed an initial public offering  or ipo  of its common stock

the principal amount of the outstanding notes was million 
upon the payment of the redemption price plus accrued interest  we recognized a million debt extinguishment loss that is included in other income on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the year ended june  costs and expenses operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to increased costs to support greater origination volume 
provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables

unrealized losses are reported as a reduction in unrealized gains to the extent that there are unrealized gains 
if there are no unrealized gains to offset the unrealized losses  the losses are considered to be other than temporary and are charged to operations 
the cumulative credit loss assumptions used to estimate the fair value of credit enhancement assets are periodically reviewed by us and modified to reflect the actual credit performance for each securitization pool through the reporting date as well as estimates of future losses considering several factors including changes in the general economy 
differences between cumulative credit loss assumptions used in individual securitization pools can be attributed to the original credit attributes of a pool  actual credit performance through the reporting date and pool seasoning to the extent that changes in economic trends will have more of an impact on the expected future performance of less seasoned pools 
we changed the cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to  excluding the bvac credit enhancement assets acquired  as of june   from a range of to as of june  we changed the cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to as of june   from a range of to as of june  on a trust by trust basis  certain trusts experienced better than expected credit performance for fiscal and and decreased cumulative credit loss assumptions 
certain other trusts experienced worse than expected credit performance for fiscal and and increased cumulative credit loss assumptions 
the net impact resulted in the recognition of unrealized gains of million for fiscal and unrealized losses of million for fiscal as well as other than temporary impairment of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
unrealized gains related to changes in interest rates of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  resulted primarily from an increase in estimated future cash flows to be generated from investment income earned on the restricted cash and trust collection accounts due to an increase in forward interest rate expectations

unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of our floating rate debt are reclassified into earnings when interest rate fluctuations on securitization notes payable or other hedged items affect earnings 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of our credit enhancement assets are reclassified into earnings when unrealized gains or losses related to interest rate fluctuations on our credit enhancement assets are reclassified 
however  if we expect that the continued reporting of a loss in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the interest rate swap agreements and the credit enhancement assets  the loss is reclassified to earnings for the amount that is not expected to be recovered

prior to october   we periodically sold receivables to trusts in securitization transactions accounted for as a sale of receivables and retained an interest in the receivables sold in the form of credit enhancement assets 
credit enhancement assets are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value  calculated based upon the present value of estimated excess future cash flows from the trusts using  among other assumptions  estimates of future credit losses on the receivables sold 
receivables sold to trusts that are subsequently charged off decrease the amount of excess future cash flows from the trusts 
if such charge offs are expected to exceed the estimates of cumulative credit losses or if the actual timing of these losses differs from expected timing  the fair value of credit enhancement assets is written down through an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings to the extent the write down exceeds any previously recorded unrealized gain

table of contents delinquencies in finance receivables are lower than delinquencies in gain on sale receivables due to improved credit performance on loans originated since february as a result of tightened credit standards as well as the relative lower overall seasoning of such finance receivables 
delinquencies in finance receivables were higher at june   as compared to june   as a result of seasoning of the finance receivables 
deferrals in accordance with our policies and guidelines  we  at times  offer payment deferrals to consumers  whereby the consumer is allowed to move up to two delinquent payments to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred  except where state law provides for a lesser amount 
our policies and guidelines  as well as certain contractual restrictions in our credit facilities and securitization transactions  limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted 
our policies and guidelines generally limit the granting of deferments on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received 
due to the nature of our customer base and policies and guidelines of the deferral program  approximately of accounts currently comprising the managed portfolio will receive a deferral at some point in the life of the account 
an account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account 
thereafter  such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account 
contracts receiving a payment deferral as an average quarterly percentage of average managed receivables outstanding were as follows years ended june  finance receivables as a percentage of average finance receivables gain on sale receivables as a percentage of average gain on sale receivables total managed portfolio as a percentage of average managed receivables the increase in finance receivables receiving a payment deferral as a percentage of finance receivables for fiscal  as compared to fiscal and  is a result of seasoning of the portfolio 
in addition  a higher level of deferments were granted in fiscal relating to the impact of hurricane katrina 
the percentage of contracts receiving a payment deferral is greater for our gain on sale receivables as compared to our finance receivables as a result of seasoning of the gain on sale receivables as well as overall improved credit performance on loans originated since february the following is a summary of total deferrals as a percentage of managed receivables outstanding june  finance receivables gain on sale total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total 
table of contents june  finance receivables gain on sale total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total we evaluate the results of our deferment strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time 
based on this evaluation  we believe that payment deferrals granted according to our policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio 
changes in deferment levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of finance receivables charged off by us 
however  the timing of a charge off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge off 
to the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off  historical charge off ratios and loss confirmation periods used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses are also impacted 
increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period  which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses

net charge offs as a percentage of average managed receivables outstanding may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio and economic factors 
the decrease in net charge offs for fiscal  as compared to fiscal and  resulted primarily from improved credit performance on loans originated since february combined with an overall improvement in recovery rates 
fiscal charge offs also include the effect of a change in our repossession charge off policy 
prior to december   receivables were charged off when we repossessed and disposed of the automobile or the account was otherwise deemed uncollectible 
in implementing the new repossession charge off policy  we incurred additional charge offs of million in fiscal related to the acceleration of charge off timing for certain accounts already repossessed

we used cash of  million   million and  million for the purchase of finance receivables during fiscal  and  respectively 
these purchases were funded initially utilizing cash and credit facilities 
subsequently  these finance receivables are financed long term through securitization transactions 
credit facilities in the normal course of business  in addition to using our available cash  we pledge receivables and borrow under our credit facilities to fund our operations and repay these borrowings as appropriate under our cash management strategy

subsequent to june   we renewed this facility  extending the maturity to september in may  we assumed the bvac receivables funding facility in connection with our acquisition of bvac 

table of contents our credit facilities contain various covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios  asset quality and portfolio performance ratios portfolio net loss  delinquency and repossession ratios  and pool level cumulative net loss ratios as well as limits on deferment levels 
failure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements 
if an event of default occurs under these agreements  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under these agreements to be immediately due and payable  enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements or restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under these agreements 
as of june   our credit facilities were in compliance with all covenants 
convertible senior notes in november  we issued million of contingently convertible senior notes that are due in november interest on the notes is payable semiannually at a rate of per annum

in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we purchased a call option that entitles us to purchase shares of our stock in an amount equal to the number of shares convertible at per share 
this call option allows us to offset the dilution of our shares if the conversion feature of the convertible senior notes is exercised

as of june   these amounts have been repaid 
prior to october   we structured our securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
we changed the structure of securitization transactions completed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables are transferred to a securitization trust  which is one of our special purpose finance subsidiaries 
the related securitization notes payable issued by these trusts remain on our consolidated balance sheets 
while these trusts 
table of contents are included in our consolidated financial statements  these trusts are separate legal entities  thus the finance receivables and other assets held by these trusts are legally owned by these trusts  are available to satisfy the related securitization notes payable and are not available to our creditors or our other subsidiaries 
this change in securitization structure does not change our requirement to provide credit enhancement in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
we typically make an initial deposit to a restricted cash account and transfer finance receivables in excess of the amount of asset backed securities issued to create initial overcollateralization 
we subsequently use excess cash flows generated by the trusts to either increase the restricted cash account or repay the outstanding asset backed securities on an accelerated basis  thereby creating additional credit enhancement through overcollateralization in the trusts 
when the credit enhancement levels reach specified percentages of the trust s pool of receivables  excess cash flows are distributed to us 
generally  we employ two types of securitization structures 
the structure we have utilized most frequently involves the purchase of a financial guaranty insurance policy issued by an insurer and may include the use of reinsurance and other alternative credit enhancement products to reduce the required initial deposit to the restricted cash account and initial overcollateralization 
the insurance policy covers timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of principal to the investors in a securitization transaction 
however  we currently have no outstanding commitments to obtain reinsurance or other alternative credit enhancement products and will likely provide initial credit enhancement requirements in future securitization transactions from our existing capital resources 
since the beginning of calendar year  with respect to our securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy  initial cash requirements and overcollateralization levels have ranged from to  with our most recent transaction completed in july at 
target credit enhancement has ranged as high as and in our most recent transaction was 
under this structure  we typically expect to begin to receive cash distributions approximately six to ten months after receivables are securitized 
our second type of securitization structure involves the sale of subordinated asset backed securities in order to provide credit enhancement for the senior asset backed securities 
the subordinated asset backed securities replace a portion of our credit enhancement required in a securitization transaction in a manner similar to the utilization of insurance or other alternative credit enhancements described in the preceding paragraph 
our most recent securitization transaction  involving the sale of subordinated asset backed securities completed in march  required an initial cash deposit and overcollateralization level of of the original receivable pool balance  and target credit enhancement levels must reach of the receivable pool balance before excess cash is used to repay the class e bonds 
subsequent to the payoff of class e bonds  excess cash is distributed to us 
under this structure  we typically expect to begin to receive cash distributions approximately to months after receivables are securitized 
increases or decreases to the credit enhancement level required in future securitization transactions will depend on the net interest margin of the finance receivables transferred  credit performance trends of our finance receivables  our financial condition and the economic environment 
cash flows related to securitization transactions were as follows in millions years ended june  initial credit enhancement deposits restricted cash overcollateralization distributions from trusts  net of swap payments gain on sale trusts secured financing trusts the agreements with the insurers of our securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default or cumulative net loss triggers in a trust s pool of receivables exceed certain targets  the specified credit enhancement levels would be increased 

table of contents prior to october  the financial guaranty insurance policies for all of our insured securitization transactions were provided by fsa 
the restricted cash account for each securitization trust insured as part of the fsa program was cross collateralized to the restricted cash accounts established in connection with our other securitization trusts in the fsa program  such that excess cash flows from an fsa program securitization that had already met its credit enhancement requirement could be used to fund target credit enhancement requirements with respect to fsa program securitizations in which specified portfolio performance ratios had been exceeded  rather than being distributed to us 
generally  our securitization transactions insured by financial guaranty insurance providers  including fsa  from october through august are cross collateralized to a limited extent 
in the event of a shortfall in the original target credit enhancement requirement for any of these securitization trusts after a certain period of time  excess cash flows from other transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be used to satisfy the shortfall amount 
in one of our securitization transactions  if a secured party receives a notice of a rating agency review for downgrade or if there is a downgrade of any class of notes without taking into consideration the presence of the financial guaranty insurance policy excess cash flows from other securitization transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be utilized to satisfy any increased target credit enhancement requirements 
our securitization transactions insured by financial guaranty insurance policies after august do not contain any cross collateralization provisions 
the agreements that we enter into with our financial guaranty insurance providers in connection with securitization transactions contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default and cumulative net loss triggers that are higher than the limits referred to above 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any insured trust were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit the financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate our servicing rights to the receivables sold to that trust 
in addition  the servicing agreements on certain insured securitization trusts are cross defaulted so that a default under one servicing agreement would allow the financial guaranty insurance provider to terminate our servicing rights under all servicing agreements for securitization trusts in which they issued a financial guaranty insurance policy 
additionally  if these higher targeted portfolio performance levels were exceeded  the financial guaranty insurance providers may elect to retain all excess cash generated by other securitization transactions insured by them as additional credit enhancement 
this  in turn  could result in defaults under our other securitizations and other material indebtedness 
although we have never exceeded these additional targeted portfolio performance ratios  and do not anticipate violating any event of default triggers for our securitizations  there can be no assurance that our servicing rights with respect to the automobile receivables in such trusts or any other trusts will not be terminated if i such targeted portfolio performance ratios are breached  ii we breach our obligations under the servicing agreements  iii the financial guaranty insurance providers are required to make payments under a policy  or iv certain bankruptcy or insolvency events were to occur 
as of june   no such termination events have occurred with respect to any of the trusts formed by us 
stock repurchases on october   we announced the approval of a stock repurchase plan by our board of directors 
the stock repurchase plan authorizes us to repurchase up to million of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions based on market conditions 
the cumulative amount of the stock repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors since april is  million 
during fiscal  and  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share   shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share and  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  respectively 
subsequent to june   we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
since april  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock 
table of contents at an average cost of per share  totaling  million of cumulative share repurchases 
as of september   we have no further authorizations for repurchases 
operating plan we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to achieve our growth strategies 
as of june   we had unrestricted cash balances of million 
assuming that origination volume ranges from billion to billion during fiscal and the initial credit enhancement requirement for our securitization transactions remains at the level for the most recent securitization covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy  completed in july we would require million to million in cash or liquidity to fund initial credit enhancement over that period 
we expect that cash distributions from our securitization transactions will exceed the funding requirement for initial credit enhancement deposits during fiscal we will continue to require the execution of additional securitization transactions during fiscal there can be no assurance that funding will be available to us through the execution of securitization transactions or  if available  that the funding will be on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to execute securitization transactions on a regular basis  and are otherwise unable to issue any other debt or equity  we would not have sufficient funds to finance new loan originations and  in such event  we would be required to revise the scale of our business  including possible discontinuation of loan origination activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to october   we structured our securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
under this structure  notes issued by our unconsolidated qualified special purpose finance subsidiaries are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
see liquidity and capital resources securitizations for a detailed discussion of our securitization transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuations in market interest rates impact our credit facilities and securitization transactions 
our gross interest rate spread  which is the difference between interest earned on our finance receivables and interest paid  is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund our purchases of finance receivables 
credit facilities finance receivables purchased by us and pledged to secure borrowings under our credit facilities bear fixed interest rates 
amounts borrowed under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility  our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under our credit facilities 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
as part of our interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by our special purpose finance subsidiary to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiary is included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold by us is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on our medium term notes facility caused by fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate 
these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents securitizations the interest rate demanded by investors in our securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
we utilize several strategies to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our gross interest rate margin  including the use of derivative financial instruments  the regular sale or pledging of auto receivables to securitization trusts and pre funding of securitization transactions 
in our securitization transactions  we transfer fixed rate finance receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various london interbank offered rates libor and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization 
the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements in libor 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap and cap agreements  are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by our securitization trusts to a fixed rate  thereby locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by us over the life of a securitization 
interest rate swap agreements purchased by us do not impact the amount of cash flows to be received by holders of the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the interest rate swap agreements serve to offset the impact of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate asset backed securities on the cash flows to be received by us from the trusts 
we utilize such arrangements to modify our net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on our risk tolerance 
in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable  usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception  we may choose not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with the issuance of floating rate securities even if we choose not to hedge our future cash flows 
although the interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the trusts  cash outflows from the trusts ultimately impact our retained interests in the securitization transactions as cash expended by the securitization trusts will decrease the ultimate amount of cash to be received by us 
therefore  when economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap agreement 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiaries in connection with securitization transactions are included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by us are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by us are reflected in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than needed to cover finance receivables initially sold or pledged to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until additional receivables are delivered to the trust in amounts up to the pre funded balance held in the escrow account 
the use of pre funded securitizations allows us to lock in borrowing costs with respect to the finance receivables subsequently delivered to the trust 
however  we incur an expense in pre funded securitizations during the period between the initial delivery of finance receivables and the subsequent delivery of finance receivables equal to the difference between the interest earned on the proceeds held in the escrow account and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding 
additionally  in may  we issued a revolving securitization transaction that allows us to replace receivables as they amortize down rather than paying down the outstanding debt balance for a period of one year subject to compliance with certain covenants 
the use of this type of transaction allows us to lock in borrowing costs for the revolving period and allows us to finance approximately more receivables than in our typical amortizing securitization structure

management monitors our hedging activities to ensure that the value of derivative financial instruments  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk
