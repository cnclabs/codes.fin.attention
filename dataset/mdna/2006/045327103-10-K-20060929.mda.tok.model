we are a leading supplier of integrated software and services to the process industries  which consist of oil and gas  petroleum  chemicals  pharmaceuticals and other industries that manufacture and produce products from a chemical process 
we provide a comprehensive  integrated suite of software applications that utilize proprietary empirical models of chemical manufacturing processes to improve plant and process design  economic evaluation  production  production planning and scheduling  and operational performance 
these solutions help our customers improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing revenues  reducing operating costs  reducing working capital requirements and decreasing capital expenditures 
we were initially incorporated in and reincorporated in delaware in we have a year track record of innovation and technology leadership in the process industries 
our customer base of over  process manufacturers includes the largest petroleum companies in the world  the largest chemical companies  of the largest pharmaceutical companies and of the largest engineering and construction firms that service the process industries 
we operate globally through offices in countries and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
in addition  we have established a number of strategic relationships to leverage our internal sales and marketing efforts  enhance the breadth of our solutions and expand our implementation capabilities 
industry background the process industries consist of oil and gas  petroleum  chemicals  pharmaceuticals and other industries that provide products from a chemical process 
process manufacturers face a number of significant challenges that are specific to each industry 
to succeed in an increasingly competitive global environment  process manufacturers must simultaneously reduce costs and increase efficiency  responsiveness and customer satisfaction 
because process manufacturing tends to be asset intensive  increases in profitability in these industries depend substantially upon reducing the costs of raw materials  energy and capital 
given the large production volumes typical in the process industries and the relatively low profit margins characteristic of many sectors within the process industries  even relatively small reductions in raw material or energy requirements or small improvements in input costs  throughput or product yields can significantly increase the profitability of the process manufacturing enterprise 
the process industries face significant challenges because of the complex activities and supply chains that must be managed when purchasing raw materials  manufacturing products  and delivering final products to customers 
factors that make it difficult for these companies to optimize these processes and make optimal economic decisions include the following products are manufactured in continuous processes that are unpredictable and difficult to model  production sequence and raw material specification both have a major impact on feasibility and profitability  multiple  interdependent products are made simultaneously  making production planning complicated  manufacturing plants are sophisticated and extremely capital intensive  and supply chain management is complex 
in addition to these factors that are common to most segments of the process industry  each vertical market has its own set of unique challenges that must be addressed in order to manage operations effectively 
oil and gas the upstream oil and gas sector is driven by the high cost of capital investment  which is being exacerbated as the search for new reserves takes companies to more remote  politically unstable locations and ever deeper oceans 
the high cost of investment places a premium on getting the most out of any expenditure 
an improperly placed well that fails to economically remove all surrounding reserves or a poorly designed transmission system that requires excessive pressurization or maintenance can have a significant impact on profitability for years to come 
in addition  managing oil and gas assets is complicated since these assets are highly complex and interconnected 
companies must achieve high output while minimizing investment  optimize facilities to match a constantly varying slate of crudes and gases  and ensure the efficient transmission of materials through large  interconnected  and environmentally sensitive pipeline infrastructure 
to further complicate the challenge  every decision occurs against the backdrop of rapidly fluctuating open market oil and gas prices 
unlike other segments of the process industries  where raw material price movements are smoothed through long term contracts  oil and gas prices can oscillate rapidly from week to week or even day to day 
this puts enormous pressure on companies to profit from rising prices while they can 
delayed decisions and prolonged production ramp ups can spell the difference between selling into a rising or falling market 
specifically  oil and gas companies face the following distinct challenges in managing their operations managing assets as an interrelated system  ensuring consistently profitable price nominations and product contracts  maximizing production with minimal capital investment  responding faster to gas and oil price fluctuations and operating disruptions  and ensuring regulatory compliance without adding administrative overhead 
petroleum in the downstream petroleum industry  prices  capacity utilization and operating margins are all reaching record highs 
as a result  there is tremendous pressure on refineries to optimize their output  maximize their product mix and minimize their inventory levels throughout the system 
at the same time  petroleum companies are recognizing that the legacy it systems that resulted from the mergers and acquisitions of the s are inadequate 
instead  they are increasingly investing in integrated software suites that can provide better visibility into all aspects of the production process  from inventory levels throughout the system to quality and production information as well as market dynamics 
this enables them to keep lower amounts on inventory on hand  make better buy vs 
make vs 
trade decisions and maximize capacity utilization at the refinery level taking into account both volume and product mix 
in addition  the need for accurate integrated information is further exacerbated by a proliferation of regional product specifications  a volatile market  and increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
running more barrels through the refinery at top capacity makes it difficult to keep the physical assets in prime condition and can create safety and reliability issues 
refiners are faced with the need to optimize the design of processes and achieve more reliable and stable operations 
process engineers are challenged with making timely business decisions while meeting the business objectives of designing and operating efficient  safe and profitable process plants 
measuring the complex interactions among equipment  feedstock  refined products and business objectives is the key to unlocking optimization at the refinery level 
specifically  petroleum companies face the following challenges in managing their operations making timely business decisions based on volatile market conditions while at the same time operating efficient  safe and profitable refineries  minimizing inventory levels throughout the system without becoming vulnerable to changes in demand or market disruptions  managing the reduced supply chain flexibility created by clean fuels legislation and the proliferation of product specifications  responding effectively to changing supply demand balances and supply patterns  and optimizing the use of energy to minimize the impact of high energy costs 
chemicals the chemical industry produces bulk chemicals that are true commodities with little or nothing to differentiate one company s offering from another 
the market is global and highly competitive 
producers routinely invest to build highly specialized  continuous process plants that reduce production costs to a minimum 
they must continue to invest over a plant s lifetime to ensure it remains cost competitive with newer units 
the most successful companies find ways to differentiate themselves through product quality  customer responsiveness and operating efficiency 
chemical companies face a number of strategic challenges 
they need to maximize the returns from their expensive assets 
they must manage wide swings in feedstock raw material costs and  high energy costs 
due to global industrial consolidation  they face increasingly concentrated and powerful competitors and customers  placing enormous pressures on their operating margins 
this pressure has eroded the advantages once enjoyed by companies with established market  technology or regional positions 
in the face of such intense pressure  producers have only a limited ability to raise prices and must instead focus on optimizing their product mix and minimizing their costs throughout the production process 
to respond to these pressures many large chemical manufacturers are looking to replace the patchwork of point solutions that they currently use to design facilities and optimize production with solutions that can address operational costs as a single  interrelated whole  much in the same way that enterprise resource planning  or erp  systems squeezed costs from the interrelated transactions that define back office business processes 
specifically  chemical producers face the following challenges in managing their operations identifying and correcting cost variations when they occur  operating assets as one interrelated system rather than as individual components  reducing plant lifecycle costs while improving operating performance  minimizing inventory without hurting customer service  responding more quickly and profitably to unexpected opportunities and disruptions  and ensuring regulatory compliance without adding administrative overhead 
pharmaceuticals changing industry dynamics and increasing competition from generic drug products are driving pharmaceutical companies to improve their operational capabilities to ensure future profitability 
as a result  many pharmaceutical companies are now viewing manufacturing and distribution not only as a means of meeting demanding quality and supply criteria but also as a means of achieving competitive advantage by reducing manufacturing costs 
pharmaceutical companies face a number of strategic challenges 
regulatory agencies are demanding strict  detailed material  process  and personnel tracking 
at the same time  companies are facing increased competition from generic drugs and must increasingly speed products to market to maximize profits 
to respond to these pressures  pharmaceutical companies are looking to implement solutions that can help them meet their regulatory requirements  reduce their time to market and decrease their production costs 
specifically  pharmaceutical companies face the following challenges in managing their operations complying with strict regulatory requirements  improving manufacturing agility to take advantage of new approaches and processes  reduce time required to scale up production  improving customer service  and reducing the complexity of it systems 
process industry technology historically  technology solutions have played a major role in helping process companies to drive productivity improvements 
in the s  this increase in efficiency came from the use of distributed control systems  or dcs  to automate the management of plant hardware 
these systems utilized computer hardware  communication networks and industrial instruments to measure  record and automatically control process variables 
however  although dcs and erp solutions are important components of a solution to improve manufacturing enterprise performance  they do not incorporate either the detailed chemical engineering knowledge essential to optimize the design and operation of related manufacturing processes or the plant performance data required to support more intelligent real time decision making and therefore their influence on day to day operational activities is limited 
today  process manufacturers are seeking tools to help them improve their operating performance  competitive position and responsiveness to increasingly volatile raw material and end markets 
for example  while rising oil prices provide an opportunity for petroleum refiners to raise their prices  they also increase the cost of operating energy intensive manufacturing facilities 
these dynamics are creating demand for intelligent decision support products that can provide an accurate real time understanding of a plant s capabilities  as well as accurate planning and collaborative forecasting information 
according to arc advisory group  the markets for process simulation and optimization  collaborative production management  and supply chain planning and collaboration software that serve this need for the process industries were collectively billion in moreover  as process manufacturers have become more adept at using products that optimize individual engineering  plant operations and supply chain management business processes  they increasingly are seeking additional performance improvements by integrating these products  both with one another and with dcs  erp and other enterprise systems  to provide real time  intelligent decision support 
to achieve these objectives  companies are implementing solutions that integrate related business processes within a single production facility and across multiple sites 
in addition  by adding planning and scheduling functionality  companies are extending these solutions by optimizing their supply chains to substantially reduce cycle times  adjusting production quickly to meet changing customer requirements  synchronizing key business processes with plants and customers across numerous geographies and time zones  and quoting delivery dates more accurately and reliably 
traditional solutions and emerging software integration vendors lack the deep process knowledge necessary to solve the complex problems faced by process manufacturers attempting to achieve true optimization of their enterprises  from design to production to management of the extended supply chain 
the aspentech advantage process manufacturers use our solutions to improve their profitability and competitiveness  not only by reducing raw material and energy use  cycle time  inventory cost and time to market  but increasingly by synchronizing and streamlining key business processes

our strategy is to continue to develop and expand relationships with third party consultants in order to provide a secondary channel of consulting services 
strategic alliances we have established strategic alliances with a few select companies that offer a complementary set of technologies  services and industry expertise that help us commercialize and accelerate the adoption of our integrated solutions  including aspenone 
these alliances include relationships with accenture  intergraph  microsoft and schlumberger 
in addition to these strategic alliances  we are focused on developing new channel partners that can help us increase sales in regions and markets that we do not effectively reach with our direct sales force 
historically  most of our license sales have been generated through our direct sales force 
technology and product development our base of chemical engineering expertise  process manufacturing experience and industry know how serves as the foundation for the proprietary solution methods  physical property models and industry specific business process knowledge embedded in our software solutions 
our software and services solutions combine three of our core competencies we support sophisticated empirical models generated from advanced mathematical algorithms developed by our employees

in addition  this software embeds key knowledge about the details of how manufacturing and supply chain operations function in the process industries 
our product development activities are currently focused on strengthening the integration between our applications and adding new capabilities that address specific mission critical operational business processes in each industry 
we intend to continue to increase the efficiency of our research and development operations through the consolidation of research and development locations and increased use of shared components across our applications 
in addition  we will continue to enhance our integrated industry specific aspenone solutions by adding new functionality  and more standardized integration with third party applications 
during fiscal  and  we incurred research and development costs of million  million and million  respectively  which represented  and of total revenue  respectively 
as of september   we employed a product development staff of approximately people 
customers our software solutions are installed at the facilities of more than  customers worldwide 
these customers include process manufacturers and the engineering and construction firms that provide services to them 
the following table sets forth a partial selection of our customers from which we generated at least  of revenues in fiscal or for fiscal  the percentages of our license revenue derived from specific vertical markets were approximately as follows from oil and gas and petroleum  from chemicals  from engineering and construction design firms  and from other segments of the process industries  the largest of which were pharmaceutical and consumer package goods

novartis pharma a pfizer consumer goods cargil pepsico procter gamble sales and marketing we employ a value based sales approach  offering our customers a comprehensive suite of software and service products that enhance the efficiency and productivity of their process manufacturing operations 
we have increasingly focused on selling our products as a strategic investment for our customers and therefore devote an increasing portion of our sales efforts at senior management levels  including senior decision makers in manufacturing  operations and technology 
our aspenone solution strategy supports this value based approach by broadening the scope of optimization across the entire spectrum of operations and expanding the use of process models in the operations environment by linking engineering  plant and business systems to improve our customers visibility into their manufacturing operations 
we believe our development of new vertical specific integrated solutions will help us to better address the top concerns of senior executives 
because the complexity and cost of our products often result in extended sales cycles  we believe that the development of long term  consultative relationships with our customers is essential to a successful selling strategy 
to develop these relationships  we focus our worldwide sales force on a defined set of strategic accounts 
in north america we have organized our sales force around specific vertical markets 
in the rest of the world the sales force is organized around specific countries or regions 
in order to market the specific functionality and other complex technical features of our software products  each sales account manager and global account manager works with specialized teams of technical sales engineers and product specialists organized for each sales and marketing effort 
our technical sales engineers typically have advanced degrees in chemical engineering or related disciplines and actively consult with a customer s plant engineers 
product specialists share their detailed knowledge of the specific features of our software solutions as they apply to the unique business processes of different vertical industries 
our overall sales force  which consists of quota carrying sales account managers  sales services personnel  business support engineers  partner organization personnel  industry business unit professionals  marketing personnel and support staff  consisted of approximately people on september  we supplement our direct sales efforts with a variety of marketing initiatives  including public relations activities  customer relationship programs  internet marketing  campaigns to promote awareness among industry analysts  user groups and events 
we also license our software products at a substantial discount to universities that agree to use our products in teaching and research 
we believe that students familiarity with our products will stimulate future demand once the students enter the workplace 
currently  more than universities use our software products in undergraduate instruction 
competition our markets are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change 
we expect the intensity of competition in our markets to increase in the future as existing competitors enhance and expand their product and service offerings and as new participants enter the market 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
some of our customers and companies with which we have strategic relationships also are  or in the future may be  competitors of ours 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have in a particular market segment or overall 
competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices  additional products or services  or other incentives that we cannot match or offer 
these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns 
they also may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers  employees and strategic partners 
many of our competitors have established  and in the future may establish  cooperative relationships with third parties to improve their product offerings and to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace 
in addition  competitors may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products 
these cooperative relationships and strategic acquisitions could reduce our market share  require us to lower our prices  or both 
our primary competitors differ between our three principal product areas our engineering software competes with products of businesses such as abb  chemstations  honeywell  kbc  shell global solutions  simulation sciences a division of invensys  and winsim formerly chemshare 
as we expand our engineering solutions into the collaborative process lifecycle management market we may face competition from companies that we have not typically competed against in the past  such as agile  parametric technology  sap  siemens and eds 
our plant operations software competes with products of companies such as abb  honeywell  invensys  rockwell  siemens and components of sap s offering 
our supply chain management software competes with products of companies such as honeywell  i technologies  manugistics a subsidiary of jda software group  infor and components of sap s supply chain offering 
in addition  we face competition in all areas of our business from large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions 
we believe the key competitive differentiator in our industry is the value  or return on investment  that our software and services provide 
we seek to develop and offer an integrated suite of targeted  high value vertical industry solutions that can be implemented with relatively limited service requirements 
we believe this approach provides us with a competitive advantage over many of our competitors  which offer software products that are more service based 
the principal competitive factors in our industry also include breadth and depth of software offerings  domain expertise of sales and service personnel  extent of consistent global support  performance and reliability  price  and time to market 
intellectual property we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements  and software security measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we have obtained or applied for patent protection in the united states with respect to some of our intellectual property  but generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property 
we have registered or applied to register some of our significant trademarks in the united states and in selected other countries 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and customers  and historically have restricted access to our software products source codes  which we regard as proprietary information 
in a few cases  we have provided copies of the source codes for products to customers solely for the purpose of special product customization and have deposited copies of the source codes for products in third party escrow accounts as security for ongoing service and license obligations 
in these cases  we rely on non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
the laws of many countries in which our products are licensed may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the laws of many countries in which we license our products protect trademarks solely on the basis of registration 
we currently possess a limited number of trademark registrations in selected foreign jurisdictions and have applied for foreign copyright and patent registrations  which correspond to the united states trademarks  copyrights and patents described above  to protect our products in foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our technology or independent development by others of technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
any misappropriation of our technology or development of competitive technologies could harm our business 
we could incur substantial costs in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
moreover  from time to time third parties may assert patent  trademark  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
in such an event  we may be required to incur significant costs in litigating a resolution to the asserted claims 
the outcome of any litigation might require that we pay damages or obtain a license of a third party s proprietary rights in order to continue licensing our products as currently offered 
if such a license were required  it might not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that the success of our business depends more on the quality of our proprietary software products  technology  processes and know how than on trademarks  copyrights or patents 
while we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable  we do not believe that our competitive position in the industry is dependent simply on obtaining legal protection for our software products and technology 
instead  we believe that the success of our business depends primarily on our ability to maintain a leadership position in developing our proprietary software products  technology  information  processes and know how 
nevertheless  we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and development processes through trademark  copyright and patent registrations  both foreign and domestic  whenever appropriate as part of our ongoing research and development activities 
employees as of september   we had a total of  full time employees 
of this total  were located in the united states and were located internationally 
we have recently been making headcount investments in lower cost areas  such as the asia pacific region 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union  except that approximately employees of hyprotech uk ltd belong to prospect union 
we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
risks related to our business fluctuations in our quarterly revenues  operating results and cash flow may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
our revenues  operating results and cash flow have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including demand for our products and services  our customers purchasing patterns  the length of our sales cycle  changes in the mix of our license revenues and service revenues  the timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements by us and our competitors  seasonal weakness in the first quarter of each fiscal year which for us is the quarter ended september  primarily caused by a slowdown in business in some of our international markets  the timing of our investments in new product development  the mix of domestic and international sales  changes in our operating expenses  and fluctuating economic conditions  particularly as they affect companies in the oil and gas  chemicals  petrochemicals and petroleum industries 
we ship software products within a short period after receipt of an order and typically do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders for software products 
consequently  revenues from software licenses in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has come from license agreements that have been entered into in the final weeks of the quarter 
therefore  even a short delay in the consummation of an agreement may cause our revenues to fall below expectations of public market analysts and investors for that quarter 
since our expense levels are based in part on anticipated revenues  we may be unable to adjust our spending quickly enough to compensate for any revenue shortfall and any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 
we expect that the factors listed above will continue to affect our operating results for the foreseeable future 
because of the factors listed above  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
term license renewal negotiations may be difficult and more time consuming than negotiations for new licenses 
moreover  customers may choose not to renew term licenses  resulting in reduced revenue to us 
in addition  customers may wish to negotiate renewals of term licenses on terms and conditions that require us to change the way we recognize revenue under our existing revenue recognition practices at the time of such renewal with such customers 
any such changes could result in a material adverse effect on our results 
if  due to one or more of the foregoing factors or an unanticipated cause  our operating results fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors in a future quarter  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict quarterly revenue levels and operating results 
because license and implementation fees for our software products are substantial and the decision to purchase our products typically involves members of our customers senior management  the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year 
accordingly  the timing of our license revenues is difficult to predict  and the delay of an order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below our expectations and those of public market analysts and investors 
moreover  to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from individual software products and toward more costly integrated suites of software and services  our sales cycle may lengthen  which could increase the likelihood of delays and cause the effect of a delay to become more pronounced 
delays in sales could cause significant shortfalls in our revenues and operating results for any particular period 
we derive a majority of our total revenues from customers in the oil and gas  chemicals  petrochemicals and petroleum industries  which are highly cyclical  and our operating results may suffer if these industries experience an economic downturn 
we derive a majority of our total revenues from companies in the oil and gas  chemicals  petrochemicals and petroleum industries 
accordingly  our future success depends upon the continued demand for manufacturing optimization software and services by companies in these process manufacturing industries 
the oil and gas  chemicals  petrochemicals and petroleum industries are highly cyclical and highly reactive to the price of oil  as well as general economic conditions 
in the past  worldwide economic downturns and pricing pressures experienced by oil and gas  chemical  petrochemical and petroleum companies have led to consolidations and reorganizations 
these downturns  pricing pressures and restructurings have caused delays and reductions in capital and operating expenditures by many of these companies 
these delays and reductions have reduced demand for products and services like ours 
a recurrence of these industry patterns  as well as general domestic and foreign economic conditions and other factors that reduce spending by companies in these industries  could harm our operating results in the future 
we have identified four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of june  that  if not remedied effectively  could result in material misstatements in our financial statements for future periods 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company  as defined in rule a f or d f promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended  which we refer to as the exchange act 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june  and identified four material weaknesses 
a material weakness is defined by the public company accounting oversight board united states as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
a significant deficiency is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected 
a control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees  in the normal course of performing their assigned functions  to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis 
the material weaknesses identified by management as of june  consisted of inadequate and ineffective controls over the periodic financial close process  ineffective and inadequate controls in the accounts receivable function over the process to record customer invoice payments timely and accurately  inadequate and ineffective controls over the accounting for income taxes  and inadequate and ineffective controls over accrual of goods and services received 
for further information about these material weaknesses  please see management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
because of these material weaknesses  our management concluded  as of june   that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
we are implementing remedial measures designed to address the material weaknesses identified as of june  if these remedial initiatives are insufficient to address the four identified material weaknesses  or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered in the future  we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations on a timely basis  our financial statements may contain material misstatements  our operating results may be harmed  we may be subject to class action litigation  and our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq global market 
for example  material weaknesses that remain unremediated could result in material post closing adjustments in future financial statements 
any failure to address the identified material weaknesses or any additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required to be included in our annual reports on form k 
internal control deficiencies could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
we can give no assurance that the measures we have taken to date or any future measures will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls 
in addition  even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures  those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements or sec reports 
we face risks related to securities litigation and investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on october   we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors had commenced an investigation into accounting for certain software license and service agreement transactions in fiscal to and  later  fiscal to time frame 
following this announcement  we and certain of our current and former officers and directors were named defendants in securities class action and derivative lawsuits filed in massachusetts federal district court  alleging violations of the exchange act and claiming material misstatements concerning our financial condition and results 
on march   the court granted final approval of a million settlement with the class 
pursuant to the terms of the class action settlement  we paid million and our insurance carrier paid million into the settlement fund 
members of the class representing  shares of common stock  or less than of the shares putatively purchased during the class action period  have opted out of this settlement and may choose to initiate their own legal actions against us actions 
to date  state law claims  which we refer to as opt out claims  including claims of fraud  statutory treble damages  deceptive practices  and or rescissory damages liability  based on the restated results of one or more fiscal periods included in the restated financial statements referenced in the class action  have been filed against us in massachusetts superior court 
defending against litigation requires significant attention and resources of management and may result in losses and damages that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
regardless of the outcome  such litigation and investigation have resulted in the past  and may continue to result in the future  in significant legal expenses and may cause our customers  employees and investors to lose confidence in our company 
also in october  the audit committee advised the sec and nasdaq of its investigation and provided them information as requested thereafter 
on october   we announced that we had received a subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york requesting documents relating to transactions to which aspentech was a party during the to time frame  associated documents dating from january   and additional materials 
on june   we announced that we had received a wells notice letter from the sec of possible civil enforcement action regarding our originally filed financial statements for fiscal years through  which we restated in march following the conclusion of the audit committee s review 
in addition  on july   we announced that three of our former executive officers had each received a wells notice letter regarding the same matter 
we have cooperated fully with the subpoena requests and in the investigation by the us attorney s office and the sec 
the investigation by the us attorney s office is ongoing in coordination with the sec 
there is no assurance  however  that the investigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are required to advance legal fees subject to undertakings of repayment if required and may be required to indemnify certain of our current or former directors and officers in connection with civil  criminal or regulatory proceedings or actions  and such indemnification commitments may be costly 
our director and officer liability insurance policies provide only limited liability protection relating to such actions against us and certain of our officers and directors and may not cover director and officer indemnification 
if these policies do not adequately cover expenses and certain liabilities relating to any proceeding or lawsuit  or if we are unable to achieve a favorable settlement thereof  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
also  increased premiums could materially harm our financial results in future periods 
the inability to obtain coverage due to prohibitively expensive premiums would make it more difficult to retain and attract officers and directors and expose us to potentially self funding any potential future liabilities ordinarily mitigated by director and officer liability insurance 
on september   we announced that  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   a subcommittee composed of our independent directors was appointed to review our accounting treatment for stock option grants in prior years and that we would restate our financial statements for certain prior fiscal years 
defending against potential litigation relating to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements would likely require significant attention and resources of management 
the review will result in  and any potential litigation could result in  significant legal expenses and may cause our customers  employees and investors to lose confidence in our company 
we are currently unable to estimate the amount of the loss  if any  that may result from resolution of these matters  but their outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
new accounting standards or interpretations of existing accounting standards could adversely affect our operating results 
generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  we recognize software license revenue in accordance with sop  as amended by sop and sop  and in accordance with sop the accounting profession continues to discuss certain provisions of relevant accounting literature with the objective of providing additional guidance on potential interpretations related to software revenue recognition and multiple element arrangements in which a single contract includes a software license  a maintenance services agreement and or other elements that are bundled together in a total offering to the customer 
these discussions and the issuance of interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  which could change the timing of revenue recognition 
certain factors have in the past and may in the future cause us to defer recognition for license fees beyond delivery  such as the inclusion of material non standard terms in our licensing agreements 
because of these factors and other specific requirements under us gaap for software revenue recognition  we must have very precise terms in our software arrangements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend our sales cycle  and we may accept terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery 
we face increased competition and continuing obligations as a result of the sale of our operator training business and hyprotech intellectual property to honeywell and the settlement of proceedings with kbc advanced technologies  which could cause us to lose market share and otherwise harm our operating results 
as a result of the consent decree we entered into with the federal trade commission  or ftc  and the related transactions with honeywell and bentley systems  we transferred our axsys product line  our operator training business  and rights to the intellectual property of the hyprotech product line 
the ability of honeywell to compete against our hyprotech engineering products  the loss of our operator training business  the ability of bentley systems to compete against our zyqad product line  and the increased costs of our support obligations to honeywell under the two year support agreement may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the hyprotech engineering products are material to our current business and strategy  and any decrease in our revenues from these products may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
because honeywell may license the hyprotech engineering products on more favorable terms than we may offer  sell the hyprotech engineering products to companies that are customers of both honeywell and us  and bundle the hyprotech engineering products with its other products for the process industries  honeywell may harm our ability to compete in the marketplace  including our ability to negotiate license renewals with our current customers 
we have continuing obligations to honeywell under our support arrangements with honeywell and the ftc consent decree relating to the hyprotech engineering products  which require significant resources and the attention of management 
we are also subject to ongoing compliance obligations under the ftc consent decree and to subpoenas and other requests for information and documents from the ftc related to whether we have complied with the ftc consent decree 
ensuring our continued compliance with the ftc consent decree may subject us to increased legal fees and other expenses and obligations 
if the ftc were to determine that we have not complied with our obligations under the consent decree  such determination could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
as part of our settlement with kbc advanced technologies  we agreed to recognize kbc s right to develop  market and license hysys 
refinery  kbc s refinery wide simulation product which competes with our refinery wide simulation product  aspen refsys 
as a result of this settlement  we may encounter increased competition from kbc  which could decrease our market share and our revenues 
in addition  our markets in general are highly competitive 
our engineering software competes with products of other businesses such as abb  chemstations  honeywell  kbc  shell global solutions  simulation sciences a division of invensys  and winsim formerly chemshare 
our plant operations software competes with products of companies such as abb  honeywell  invensys  rockwell  siemens and components of sap s offering 
our supply chain management software competes with products of companies such as honeywell  i technologies  manugistics a subsidiary of jda software group  infor and components of sap s supply chain offering 
as we expand our engineering solutions into other markets we may face competition from companies that we have not typically competed against in the past or competition from companies in areas where we have not competed in the past  such as abb  agile  eds  honeywell  invensys  parametric technology  sap and siemens 
we also face competition in all areas of our business from large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have established  and may in the future continue to establish  cooperative relationships with third parties to improve their product offerings and to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace 
in addition  competitors may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products 
these cooperative relationships and strategic acquisitions could reduce our market share  require us to lower our prices  or both 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
if economic conditions and the markets for our products do not continue to improve  sales of our product lines  particularly our manufacturing supply chain product suites  will be adversely affected 
adverse changes in the economy and global economic and political uncertainty have previously caused delays and reductions in information technology spending by our customers and a consequent deterioration of the markets for our products and services  particularly our manufacturing supply chain product suites 
if adverse economic conditions worsen or do not continue to improve  we will experience further reductions  delays  and postponements of customer purchases that will negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
if economic and political conditions and the market for our products do not continue to improve and our revenues decline  our business could be harmed  and we may not be able to further reduce our costs to align them with these decreased revenues 
if we do not continue to make the technological advances required by the marketplace  our business could be seriously harmed 
enterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide greater levels of functionality and broader product offerings 
moreover  competitors continue to make rapid technological advances in computer hardware and software technology and frequently introduce new products  services and enhancements 
we must continue to enhance our current product line and develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and the technological developments of our competitors 
our business and operating results could suffer if we cannot successfully respond to the technological advances of others or if our new products or product enhancements and services do not achieve market acceptance 
under our business plan  we are investing significantly in the development of new business process products that are intended to anticipate and meet the emerging needs of our target markets 
we are implementing a product strategy that unify our software solutions under the aspenone brand with differentiated aspenone vertical solutions targeted at specific process industries 
we cannot assure you that our product strategy will result in products that will meet market needs and achieve significant market acceptance 
if we are unable to successfully market our products to senior executives of potential customers  our revenue growth may be limited 
with the development of our integrated aspenone solutions  we frequently must focus on selling the strategic value of our technology to the highest executive levels of customer organizations  typically the chief executive officer  chief financial officer or chief information officer 
if we are not successful at selling and marketing to senior executives  our revenue growth and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop or maintain strategic alliance relationships  our revenue growth may be harmed 
an element of our growth strategy is to establish strategic alliances with a selected third party systems integrators that market and integrate our products 
if our current systems integrators terminate their existing relationships with us  or if we do not adequately train a sufficient number of other systems integrators  or if potential systems integrators focus their efforts on integrating or co selling competing products to the process industries  our future revenue growth could be limited and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
if our systems integrators fail to implement our solutions for our customers properly  the reputations of our products and services and our company could be harmed and we might be subject to claims by our customers 
we intend to continue to establish business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our products and services 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in maintaining our existing relationships and developing new relationships  our revenue growth may be materially and adversely affected 
we may suffer losses on fixed price engagements 
we derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from service engagements and a significant percentage of these engagements have been undertaken on a fixed price basis 
under these fixed price engagements  we bear the risk of cost overruns and inflation  and as a result  any of these engagements may be unprofitable 
in the past  we have had cost overruns on fixed price service engagements 
in addition  to the extent that we are successful in shifting customer purchases to our integrated suites of software and services and we price those engagements on a fixed price basis  the size of our fixed price engagements may increase  which could cause the impact of an unprofitable fixed price engagement to have a more pronounced impact on our operating results 
our business may suffer if we fail to address the challenges associated with international operations 
we derived approximately of our total revenues from customers outside the united states in the fiscal years ended june  and we anticipate that revenues from customers outside the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our operations outside the united states are subject to additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  less effective protection of intellectual property  difficulties in managing distributors and representatives and potential losses associated with termination of such arrangements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  difficulties and delays in translating products and product documentation into foreign languages  difficulties and delays in negotiating software licenses compliant with accounting revenue recognition requirements in the united states  difficulties in collecting trade accounts receivable in other countries  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results cannot be accurately predicted 
in recent years  we have increased the extent to which we denominate arrangements with international customers in the currencies of the countries in which the software or services are provided 
from time to time we have engaged in  and may continue to engage in  hedges of a significant portion of installment contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
any hedging policies implemented by us may not be successful  and the cost of these hedging techniques may have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which could make us less competitive and cause us to lose market share 
we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements  and software security measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we have registered or have applied to register several of our significant trademarks in the united states and in certain other countries 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and customers  and historically have restricted access to our software products source codes  which we regard as proprietary information 
in a few cases  we have provided copies of the source code for some of our products to customers solely for the purpose of special product customization and have deposited copies of the source code for some of our products in third party escrow accounts as security for ongoing service and license obligations 
in these cases  we rely on non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our technology or independent development by others of technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
any misappropriation of our technology or development of competitive technologies could harm our business  and could force us to incur substantial costs in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
the laws of some countries in which our products are licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
third party claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others may be costly to defend or settle and could damage our business 
we cannot be certain that our software and services do not infringe issued patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the software industry  and we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees concerning their use of our software products and integration technologies and services 
although we believe that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to market our software without incurring liability to third parties  third parties may bring claims of infringement against us 
because our software is integrated with our customers networks and business processes  as well as other software applications  third parties may bring claims of infringement against us  as well as our customers and other software suppliers  if the cause of the alleged infringement cannot easily be determined 
such claims may be with or without merit 
claims of alleged infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business and may discourage potential customers from doing business with us on acceptable terms  if at all 
defending against claims of infringement may be time consuming and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including our management s attention to our business 
furthermore  a party making an infringement claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our software or require that we re engineer some or all of our products 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter costly royalty or license agreements 
we may be unable  however  to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed significantly if any of these events occurred  and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
in addition  we have agreed  and may agree in the future  to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our software infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against infringement claims 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we  as well as our customers  may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required licenses could harm our business  operating results and financial condition and the price of our common stock 
in addition  although we carry general liability insurance  our current insurance coverage may not apply to  and likely would not protect us from  all liability that may be imposed under these types of claims 
because some of our software products incorporate technology licensed from  or provided by  third parties  the loss of our right to use that technology or defects in that third party technology could harm our business 
some of our software products contain technology that is licensed from  or provided by  third parties 
any significant interruption in the supply or support of any such third party software could adversely affect our sales  unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by the third party software 
because some of our software incorporates software developed and maintained by third parties  we depend on these third parties to deliver and support reliable products  enhance our current software  develop new software on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
in other instances we provide third party software with our current software  and we depend on these third parties to deliver reliable products  provide underlying product support and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
the failure of these third parties to meet these criteria could harm our business 
our software is complex and may contain undetected errors 
like many other complex software products  our software has on occasion contained undetected errors or bugs 
because new releases of our software products are initially installed only by a selected group of customers  any errors or bugs in those new releases may not be detected for a number of months after the delivery of the software 
these errors could result in loss of customers  harm to our reputation  adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased insurance costs or claims against us by customers 
we may be subject to significant expenses and damages because of liability claims 
the sale and implementation of certain of our software products and services  particularly in the areas of advanced process control and optimization  entail the risk of product liability claims and associated damages 
our software products and services are often integrated with our customers networks and software applications and are used in the design  operation and management of manufacturing processes at large facilities  often for mission critical applications 
any errors  defects  performance problems or other failure of our software could result in significant liability to us for damages or for violations of environmental  safety and other laws and regulations 
we are currently defending claims that our software products and implementation services have failed to meet customer expectations  and our software products and implementation services could continue to give rise to warranty and other claims 
our agreements with our customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions in our agreements may not be effective as a result of federal  foreign  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
a substantial product liability judgment against us could materially and adversely harm our operating results and financial condition 
also  even if our software is not at fault  a product liability claim brought against us could be time consuming  costly to defend and harmful to our operations 
in addition  although we carry general liability insurance  our current insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect us from all liability that may be imposed under these types of claims 
implementation of our products can be difficult and time consuming  and customers may be unable to implement our products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to our products 
our products are intended to work with complex business processes 
some of our software  such as customized scheduling applications and integrated supply chain products  must integrate with the existing computer systems and software programs of our customers 
this can be complex  time consuming and expensive 
as a result  some customers may have difficulty in implementing or be unable to implement these products successfully or otherwise achieve the benefits attributable to these products 
customers may also make claims against us relating to the functionality  performance or implementation of this software 
delayed or ineffective implementation of the software products or related services may limit our ability to expand our revenues and may result in customer dissatisfaction  harm to our reputation and may result in customer unwillingness to pay the fees associated with these products 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining management team members and other highly qualified individuals in our industry  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership in the highly competitive software market depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial  sales and technical personnel 
we have recently had a number of changes in our senior management  including the hiring of a new chief financial officer in september in addition  several of our executive officers have not entered into employment agreements with us 
in the future  we may experience the departure of senior executives due to competition for talent from start ups and other companies 
our future success depends on a continued  successful management transition and will also depend on our continuing to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in our industry is intense 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations may increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act  which became law in july  and new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market have imposed various new requirements on public companies  including requiring changes in corporate governance practices 
our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations have increased our annual legal and financial compliance costs  have made some activities more time consuming and costly  and could expose us to additional liability 
we incurred approximately million in sarbanes oxley related expenses in our fiscal year ended june   and we expect to continue to incur significant sarbanes oxley related expenses for the foreseeable future 
in addition  these rules and regulations may make retention and recruitment of qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or executive management more difficult 
we continue to evaluate and monitor regulatory and legislative developments and cannot reliably estimate the timing or magnitude of all costs we may incur as a result of the sarbanes oxley act or other related legislation or regulation 
risks related to our common stock our common stock may experience substantial price and volume fluctuations 
the equity markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the high technology sector  and those fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  factors such as our financial performance  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  as well as market conditions in the computer software or hardware industries  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
in march  we settled a putative class action lawsuit that was pending against us in us district court  district of massachusetts  as described under we face risks related to securities litigation and investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  state law claims  which we refer to as opt out claims  including claims of fraud  statutory treble damages  deceptive practices  and or rescissory damages liability  based on the restated results of one or more fiscal periods included in the restated financial statements referenced in the class action  have been filed against us in massachusetts superior court 
this type of litigation could result in substantial liability and costs and divert management s attention and resources 
our common stockholders may experience further dilution as a result of provisions contained in our outstanding series d preferred and warrants 
the terms of our outstanding securities may result in substantial dilution to existing common stockholders 
in august  we issued  shares of series d preferred and delivered cash and  shares of series d preferred in consideration for the surrender of all of our outstanding series b preferred 
each share of our series d preferred is currently convertible  at the holder s option  into shares of our common stock and may be converted into additional shares of our common stock upon certain events as a result of antidilution provisions in our charter 
in addition  we issued the wd warrants and exchanged existing warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for the wb warrants 
the wd warrants and wb warrants are currently exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and may be converted into additional shares upon certain events as a result of antidilution provisions in the warrants 
the series d preferred  together with the wd warrants and wb warrants  were issued to several investment partnerships managed by advent international corporation and to holders of our series b preferred 
in addition to the series d preferred and the wd and wb warrants  we currently have additional warrants outstanding that are exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
our common stockholders would be subject to substantial dilution if the series d preferred is converted into common stock or if our outstanding warrants are exercised for common stock 
each share of series d preferred is entitled to a cumulative dividend of of the stated value per share of such series d preferred per year  payable at the discretion of the board of directors or upon conversion of the series d preferred to common stock or redemption of the series d preferred 
accumulated dividends  when and if declared by our board  could be paid in cash or  subject to specified conditions  common stock 
if we elect to pay dividends in shares of common stock  we will issue a number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the dividend payment by the volume weighted average of the sale prices of the common stock on the nasdaq global market for consecutive trading days  ending on the fourth trading day prior to the required dividend payment date 
we are obligated to register for public sale shares of common stock issuable pursuant to our outstanding series d preferred and warrants  and sales of those shares may result in a decrease in the price of our common stock 
we have granted rights to require that we register under the securities act the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of  or as dividends on  the series d preferred and upon the exercise of either the wb warrants or wd warrants series d preferred 
the holders of the series d preferred have the right to demand that we file on their behalf up to four registration statements covering shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of the series d preferred and b exercise of the wd warrants issued to the holders of the series d preferred 
in may  we received a demand letter from the series d preferred holders  in accordance with the terms of their investor rights agreement with us  requesting the registration of all of the shares of common stock into which their shares of series d preferred are convertible and their wd warrants are exercisable in an underwritten public offering 
as of september   the total number of shares of common stock that would be covered by this registration demand letter is approximately  we are continuing to discuss this letter with our professional advisors and the series d preferred holders 
series d preferred 
we previously filed a registration statement that covers all of the shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of the series d preferred and b exercise of the wb and wd warrants issued to the initial holders of the series d preferred 
in addition  to the extent we elect to pay dividends on the series d preferred in shares of our common stock  we are required to register such shares 
any sale of common stock into the public market by the holders of the series d preferred pursuant to a registration statement could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
we may need to raise capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect that our current cash balances  cash equivalents  short term investments  proceeds from the anticipated sale of installment contracts  funds available under our bank line of credit  and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  however  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  fewer sales of installment contracts  unanticipated expenses  including those related to the class action lawsuits or their outcome or settlement  or other unforeseen difficulties 
our sales of receivables are an important part of our cash management program 
we currently have arrangements to sell long term contracts to three financial institutions  general electric capital corporation  bank of america and silicon valley bank 
these contracts represent amounts due over the life of existing term licenses 
under the three arrangements  we sold installments receivable of million and million during the three and twelve months ended june   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june   our installments receivable balance increased to million at june  from million at june  our ability to continue these arrangements or replace them with similar arrangements is important to maintain adequate funding 
if there is insufficient interest from third parties in purchasing our installments receivable contracts  our ability to generate cash required to meet our financial obligations may be impaired 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations through the sales of our installments receivable contracts  we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or raise additional capital 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
the holders of our series d preferred and wb and wd warrants own a substantial portion of our capital stock that may afford them significant influence over our affairs 
as of september   the series d preferred as converted to common stock represented of our outstanding common stock and the wb and wd warrants were exercisable for a number of shares representing of our outstanding common stock ignoring certain limitations on the ability to convert such shares or exercise such warrants 
as a result  the holders of the series d preferred and the wb and wd warrants  if acting together  would have the ability to delay or prevent a change in control of our company that may be favored by other stockholders and otherwise exercise significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote  including any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  the approval of some mergers and other significant corporate transactions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  or the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
in addition  the holders of the series d preferred have elected three of our non employee board members 
accordingly  the holders of our series d preferred may be able to exert substantial influence over matters submitted for board approval 
our corporate documents and provisions of delaware law may prevent a change in control or management that stockholders may consider desirable 
section of the delaware general corporation law and our charter and by laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

restatement of financial results in connection with the preparation of financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   a subcommittee of independent members of our board of directors reviewed our accounting treatment for all stock options granted since we completed our initial public offering in fiscal based upon the subcommittee s review  the audit committee and management determined that certain option grants during fiscal years through were accounted for improperly  and concluded that stock based compensation associated with certain grants was misstated in fiscal years through  and in the nine months ended march  the subcommittee identified errors related to the determination of the measurement dates for grants of options allocated among a pool of employees when the specific number of options to be awarded to specific employees had not yet been finalized  and other measurement date errors 
as a result of the errors in determining measurement dates  we also recorded payroll withholding tax related adjustments for certain options formerly classified as incentive stock option iso grants under internal revenue service regulations 
these options were determined to have been granted with an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the actual grant date  so do not qualify for iso tax treatment 
the disqualification of iso classification and the resulting conversion to non qualified status results in additional withholding taxes on exercise of those options 
we recorded a cumulative estimated payroll withholding tax liability of million for the years ended june   and in connection with the disqualification of such iso tax treatment 
the stock based compensation charges  including the aforementioned withholding tax adjustments  increased net loss for the fiscal years ended june           and the nine months ended march  by million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  as a result of the errors in determining measurement dates  certain options were determined to have been granted with an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the actual grant date 
these discounted options vesting subsequent to december result in nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of section a of the internal revenue code  and holders are subject to an excise tax on the value of the options in the year in which they vest 
we have concluded that it is probable we will either implement a plan to assist the affected employees for the amount of this tax  or adjust the terms of the original option grant which would also have financial statement ramifications 
as such  we recorded an estimated liability of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with this contingency 
the restatement of prior year financial statements also includes the adjustments for other errors identified after the applicable period had been reported 
such errors were not previously recorded because we believed the amount of any such errors  both individually and in the aggregate  were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
these errors related to the timing of revenue recognition  losses on sales and disposals of assets  interest income  and the calculation of foreign currency gains and losses 
as a result of the foregoing  we have restated our financial statements as of june  and for the fiscal years ended june  and in our consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f we show the effects of the restatement on our financial statements for the years ended june    and in item  selected financial data

accrued expenses  june  change in estimate revised assumptions fiscal payments accrued expenses  june  expected final payment date september december critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition for both software licenses and fixed fee consulting services  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets  accrual of legal fees associated with outstanding litigation  accounting for income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for securitization of installments receivable  restructuring accruals  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition software licenses we recognize software license revenue in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
 as well as the various interpretations and clarifications of those statements 
when we provide professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue from the fees for such revenue and any related software licenses in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain performance type contracts 
these statements require that four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between ourselves and a third party exists  delivery of our product has occurred  the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly the criteria relating to the determination of whether the fee is fixed and determinable and the criteria relating to the collectibility of the receivables  particularly the installments receivable  relating to such sales 
these two criteria are particularly relevant to reseller transactions where  specifically  revenue is only recognized upon delivery to the end user  since the determination of whether the fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is probable is more difficult 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  all or substantially all of the software license revenue recognized for such transactions could be deferred 
revenue recognition fixed fee consulting services we recognize revenue associated with fixed fee service contracts in accordance with the proportional performance method  measured by the percentage of costs primarily labor incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs primarily labor for each contract 
when a loss is anticipated on a contract  the full amount of the anticipated loss is provided currently 
our management uses its judgment concerning the estimation of the total costs to complete the contract  considering a number of factors including the experience of the personnel that are performing the services and the overall complexity of the project 
we have a significant amount of experience in the estimation of the total costs to complete a contract and have not typically recorded material losses related to these estimates 
we do not expect the accuracy of our estimates to change significantly in the future 
should changes and conditions cause actual results to differ significantly from management s estimates  revenue recognized in future periods could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review the carrying value of long lived assets when circumstances dictate that they should be reevaluated  based upon the expected future operating cash flows of our business 
these future cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
historically  actual results have occasionally differed from our estimated future cash flow estimates 
in the future  actual results may differ materially from these estimates  and accordingly cause a full impairment of our long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we conduct at least an annual assessment on january st of the carrying value of our goodwill assets  which is based on either estimates of future income from the reporting units or estimates of the market value of the units  based on comparable recent transactions 
these estimates of future income are based upon historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions  and are continuously reviewed based on actual operating trends 
historically  actual results have occasionally differed from our estimated future cash flow estimates 
in the future  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  the relevancy of recent transactions used to establish market value for our reporting units is based on management s judgment 
during the year ended june   we recorded million in charges related to the impairment of certain long lived assets and technology related intangible and computer software development assets 
the timing and size of future impairment charges involves the application of management s judgment and estimates and could result in the impairment of all or substantially all of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  which totaled million as of june  accrual of legal fees associated with outstanding litigation we accrue estimated future legal fees associated with outstanding litigation for which management has determined that it is probable that a loss contingency exists 
this requires management to estimate the amount of legal fees that will be incurred in the defense of the litigation 
these estimates are based heavily on our expectations of the scope  length to complete and complexity of the claims 
historically  as these factors have changed after our original estimates  we have adjusted our estimates accordingly 
in the future  additional adjustments may be recorded as the scope  length or complexity of outstanding litigation changes 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets also result from unused operating loss carryforwards  research and development tax credit carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against these deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could result in a tax provision equal to the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
during the year ended june   we recorded a million valuation allowance against our us domiciled net deferred tax assets 
since that point  we have provided a full valuation allowance for all us domiciled net deferred tax assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables for which collection is doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
in determining these provisions  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required for all or substantially all of certain receivable balances 
accounting for securitization of installments receivable we made judgments with respect to several variables associated with our june securitization transaction that had a significant impact on the valuation of our retained interest in the sold receivables  as well as the calculation of the loss on the transaction 
these judgments include the discount rate used to value the retained interest in the sold receivables  and estimates of rates of default 
in determining these factors  we consulted third parties with respect to fair market discount rates  and analyzed our historical collection experience to default rates and collection timing 
if the historical collection data do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  the value of our retained interest may fluctuate 
accounting for restructuring accruals we follow sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in accounting for these obligations  we are required to make assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance  benefits  and related costs and to the time period over which facilities will remain vacant  sublease terms  sublease rates and discount rates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best information available at the time the obligation has arisen 
these estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate  changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the amount accrued on the balance sheet 
accounting for stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective july  under the fair value provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
sfas r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly for assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates to value stock based compensation in net income 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could fluctuate significantly

revenues are derived from software licenses  consulting services and maintenance and training 
total revenues for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal software license revenues are attributable to software license renewals covering existing users  the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  to the addition of new customers 
our new customer base is less significant since we believe that we already have the significant players in the process industries as existing customers 
we believe that the increase principally reflected strength in our energy end market  as well as continued strength in our chemicals and engineering construction end markets  combined with the increased efforts and time that our management were able to dedicate to software license activities  and the increased willingness of our customers to make investments in our products  following the resolution of the federal trade commission  or ftc  proceedings and the audit committee investigation in fiscal revenues from service and other consist of consulting services  post contract support on software licenses  training and sales of documentation 
revenues from service and other were relatively unchanged at million for fiscal and for fiscal as a decline in the consulting services business was offset by a increase in maintenance and training revenues 
consulting services declined due to the december sale of a portion of our consulting business to honeywell  as part of our settlement with the ftc 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists of royalties  amortization of previously capitalized software costs  costs related to delivery of software  including disk duplication and third party software costs  printing of manuals and packaging 
cost of software licenses for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the reduction in cost as a percentage of revenue is due to the increase in revenue over a base of costs  of which many are fixed in nature 
cost of service and other 
cost of service and other consists of the cost of execution of application consulting services  technical support expenses and the cost of training services 
cost of service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in cost is primarily due to decreased payroll costs of million and decreased rent and facility costs of million related to reductions in headcount and facility consolidations offset in part by increases of million in reimbursable costs and a million increase in stock based compensation costs 
amortization of technology related intangible assets 
amortization of technology related intangible assets consists of the amortization from intangible assets obtained in acquisitions 
these assets are generally being amortized over a period of three to five years 
amortization expense was million in both fiscal and fiscal selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  declining as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the reduction in cost is primarily due to a decrease in payroll costs of million  lower rent and facility costs of million  lower marketing and advertising costs of million  lower travel expenses of million and a million decrease in advertising costs related to aspenworld  which took place in october  partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of personnel and outside consultancy costs required to conduct our product development efforts 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in payroll costs  a million reduction in consultant costs  a million reduction in depreciation  and a million decrease in rent and facility costs  partially offset by a million decrease in software development costs eligible for capitalization and a million increase in stock based compensation costs 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total engineering costs during fiscal  as compared to in fiscal these percentages will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year  depending upon the stage of development for the various projects in a given period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative  executive  financial and legal personnel  and outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
this decrease is due to a million reduction in legal  accounting and consulting costs associated with the internal investigation by the audit committee  a million decrease in payroll costs  and a million reduction in rent and facility costs  partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation costs and increased recruiting costs of million 
restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
during fiscal we recorded an additional million related to headcount reductions  relocation costs and facility consolidations associated with the may plan that did not qualify for accrual at june  the remaining million relates to revisions of estimates associated with lease exit costs and accretion of the discounted restructuring accruals under previous restructuring plans 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
of this amount  million related to headcount reductions and facility consolidations associated with the june restructuring plan that did not qualify for accrual at june   million related to the may restructuring charge  million related to the accretion of discounted restructuring accruals  and million related to adjustments to prior restructuring accruals  all offset by million in ftc legal cost  related to the ftc challenge of our acquisition of hyprotech 
loss gain on sales of assets 
losses and gains on sales and disposals of assets primarily result from our programs to sell installment receivable contracts and from disposals of fixed assets 
loss on sales of assets was a million loss in fiscal as compared to a million loss in fiscal this decline is due to the absence of the million loss incurred on the securitization of installments receivable in fiscal interest income 
interest income is generated from investment of excess cash and from the license of software pursuant to installment contracts 
under these installment contracts  we offer a customer the option to make annual payments for its term licenses instead of a single license fee payment at the beginning of the license term 
historically  a substantial majority of the asset optimization customers have elected to license these products through installment contracts 
included in the annual payments is an implicit interest rate established by us at the time of the license 
as we sell more perpetual licenses for value chain solutions  these sales are being paid for in forms that are generally not installment contracts 
if the mix of sales moves away from installment contracts  interest income in future periods will be reduced 
we sell a portion of the installment contracts to unrelated financial institutions 
the interest earned by us on the installment contract portfolio in any one year is the result of the implicit interest rate established by us on installment contracts and the size of the contract portfolio 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease primarily is due to the securitization of approximately million of our installments receivable in june  which significantly lowered the average carrying balance of our installments receivable 
interest expense 
interest expense was incurred under our convertible debentures and through the course of other financing transactions 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease in interest expense resulted from the retirement of our convertible debentures in june foreign currency exchange gain loss 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily incurred through the revaluation of receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
in fiscal we recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of million  compared to a million loss in fiscal this increase was primarily due to favorable exchange rate fluctuations and effective hedging of foreign receivable balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal  primarily related to foreign taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal and provided a full valuation allowance against the net operating losses generated during fiscal under sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset related to the future benefit of a tax loss carryforward should be recorded unless we make a determination that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset would not be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance would be provided against the deferred tax asset to the extent that we cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in determining the amount of valuation allowance required  we consider numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income  the volatility of the historical earnings  and the volatility of earnings of the industry in which we operate 
we periodically review our deferred tax asset to determine if such asset is realizable 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal total revenues from customers outside the united states were million or of total revenues and million or of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the geographical mix of revenues can vary from period to period 
software license revenues represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from software licenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal software license revenues are attributable to software license renewals covering existing users  the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products  and  to a lesser extent  to the addition of new customers 
we believe that the decrease was primarily due to distractions caused by the ongoing uncertainty of the ftc proceedings  our audit committee investigation  changes in sales management and delays in purchasing from customers 
revenues from service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal these decreases were attributable primarily to the consulting services business 
consulting services decreased due to the general low level of licenses of our supply chain products during the two most recent fiscal years 
our consulting services are more heavily linked to the implementation of our supply chain products than they are to our other products 
we believe that the decrease was also due to distractions caused by the ongoing uncertainty of the ftc proceedings and our audit committee investigation 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal cost of software licenses as a percentage of revenues from software licenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the cost increase is primarily due to an increase in amortization of computer software development costs of million 
the increase in the amortization of computer software development costs is related to several significant product releases  including aspenone in december cost of service and other 
cost of service and other for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal cost of service and other  as a percentage of revenues from service and other  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in cost is primarily due to decreased payroll costs of million related to reductions in headcount  as well as a decrease in reimbursable expenses of million and a million reduction in stock based compensation 
amortization of technology related intangible assets 
amortization expense for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  while increasing as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease in cost is primarily due to a decrease in payroll costs of million attributable to the headcount reductions effected in the june restructuring plan and a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  offset by an increase in advertising costs of million related to aspenworld  which took place in october research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in payroll costs and a million decrease in facilities related costs associated with the june restructuring plan  and a million decrease in consulting costs  partially offset by a decline in stock based compensation expense of million 
we capitalized software development costs that amounted to of our total engineering costs during fiscal  as compared to in fiscal these percentages will vary from quarter to quarter  depending upon the stage of development for the various projects in a given period 
this increase is primarily due to the significant amount of effort associated with the development and release of aspenone in december and aspenone in may general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal  and increased as a percentage of total revenues to from 
this increase is due to a million increase in legal  accounting and consulting costs associated with the internal investigation by the audit committee  million in litigation defense and settlement costs related to kbc  a million increase in audit and consulting fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act  specifically our section efforts  and million in contract and employment termination costs  offset in part by a million decline in stock based compensation expense 
long lived asset impairment charges 
in fiscal  this amount consisted of million in impairment charges based on our decision to discontinue certain internal capital projects that had previously been put on hold 
in addition  certain fixed assets that supported research and development efforts were considered impaired as a result of the product consolidation decisions made in the april product review 
restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges and ftc legal costs 
of this amount  million related to headcount reductions and facility consolidations associated with the june restructuring plan that did not qualify for accrual at june   million related to the may restructuring charge  million related to the accretion of discounted restructuring accruals  and million related to adjustments to prior restructuring accruals  all offset by million in ftc legal costs  related to the ftc challenge of our acquisition of hyprotech 
in may  we initiated a plan to consolidate several corporate functions and to reduce our operating expenses 
the plan to reduce operating expenses primarily resulted in headcount reductions  and also included the termination of a contract and the consolidation of facilities 
these actions resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the components of the restructuring plan are as follows closure consolidation of facilities approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of a facility lease 
the facility lease had a remaining term of two years 
the amount accrued is an estimate of the remaining obligation under the lease  reduced by expected income from the sublease of the underlying properties 
employee severance  benefits and related costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to the reduction in headcount 
approximately employees  or of the workforce  were eliminated under the restructuring plan 
the employees were primarily located in north america and europe 
all business units were affected  including services  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
contract termination costs approximately million of the restructuring charge relates to charges associated with the termination of a contract for a future user conference 
the contract was terminated in june loss gain on sales of assets 
loss gain on sales of assets was a million loss in fiscal as compared to million gain in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the loss of million incurred on the june securitization of installments receivable 
interest income 
interest income was million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease primarily is due to the increased sale of receivables and lower license revenues  resulting in the decrease of installments receivable balance 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease in interest expense results from the elimination of interest bearing debt  such as the retirement of a portion of the convertible debentures in january  march and may  and the retirement of the remaining portion in june foreign currency exchange gain loss 
in fiscal we recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of million  compared to a million gain in fiscal this increase was due to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal  primarily related to foreign taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal the provision for fiscal includes a million valuation allowance against us domiciled net deferred tax assets and a million provision primarily related to foreign taxes 
additionally  as part of a change in the japan us tax treaty  the japanese withholding tax law was repealed effective july  and provided approximately million of income tax relief to the company as of the enactment date of the tax law change which occurred in the quarter ended march  we provided a full valuation allowance against the net operating losses generated during fiscal and under sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset related to the future benefit of a tax loss carryforward should be recorded unless we make a determination that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset would not be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance would be provided against the deferred tax asset to the extent that we cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in determining the amount of valuation allowance required  we consider numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income  the volatility of the historical earnings  and the volatility of earnings of the industry in which we operate 
we periodically review our deferred tax asset to determine if such asset is realizable 
in fiscal  we concluded  in accordance with sfas no 
 that we should record a valuation allowance on a significant portion of our deferred tax asset under the more likely than not test and therefore increased the amount of the valuation allowance 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
equity in earnings from joint ventures 
equity in earnings from joint ventures was a million loss in fiscal these losses relate to net losses incurred by certain joint ventures in which we have an equity interest 
these investments were liquidated during fiscal  and there were no material gains or losses realized 
quarterly results our operating results and cash flow have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including purchasing patterns  timing of introductions of new solutions and enhancements by us and our competitors  and fluctuating economic conditions 
because license fees for our software products are substantial and the implementation of our solutions often involve the services of engineers over an extended period of time  the sales process for our solutions is lengthy and can exceed one year 
accordingly  software revenues are difficult to predict  and the delay of any order could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
moreover  to the extent that we succeed in shifting customer purchases away from point solutions and toward integrated solutions  the likelihood of delays in ordering may increase and the effect of any delay may become more pronounced 
we ship software products within a short period after receipt of an order and usually do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  revenues from software licenses  including license renewals  in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has been derived from license agreements that have been consummated in the final weeks of the quarter 
therefore  even a short delay in the consummation of an agreement may cause revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
since our expense levels are based in part on anticipated revenues  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall and any revenue shortfall would likely have a disproportionately adverse effect on net income 
we expect that these factors will continue to affect our operating results for the foreseeable future

liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  operating activities provided million of cash as net income  excluding non cash expenses for stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization  was partially offset by cash payments related to restructuring  legal and financial accruals and an increase in installments receivable 
in fiscal and  operating activities provided million and million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  investing activities used million of cash primarily as a result of the capitalization of computer software development costs and the ordinary purchases of property and equipment 
in fiscal and  investing activities used million million of cash  respectively 
in fiscal  financing activities provided million of cash primarily due to exercise of stock options  partially offset by payment of preferred stock dividends 
in fiscal and  financing activities provided million of cash and used million of cash  respectively 
historically  we have financed our operations principally through cash generated from public offerings of our convertible debentures and common stock  private offerings of our preferred stock and common stock  operating activities  and the sale of installment contracts to third parties 
on june   we paid million to retire all of the outstanding principal amount of our convertible debentures  together with interest accrued thereon 
we funded this payment with a million of our existing cash  b million obtained from our sales of installments receivable under our existing receivables programs with silicon valley bank and ge capital corporation  and c million through the sale of additional installments receivable under the arrangement described below 
on june   we securitized outstanding installment software license receivables totaling million 
such securitization was structured in a manner so that the securitization qualified as a sale 
we received million of cash and retained an interest in the sold receivables valued at million 
we also retained certain limited recourse obligations relative to the receivables valued at approximately million 
overall  the transaction including million in aggregate fees and expenses  including fees of the lenders agent and fees of our outside legal counsel and financial advisors resulted in a loss of million in the quarter ended june  and was recorded as a loss on sales and disposals of assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
we expect that these installments receivable will generate approximately million and million of cash flows during fiscal years and that we would have received  if not for the securitization of these receivables 
this transaction allowed us to accelerate the collection of cash associated with our installments receivable 
from time to time  it is likely that we will engage in other securitization transactions 
in august  we issued and sold  shares of series d preferred  along with wd warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
concurrently  we paid million and issued  shares of series d preferred  along with wb and wd warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  to repurchase all of the outstanding series b preferred 
the series d preferred earns cumulative dividends at an annual rate of  that are payable when and if declared by the board  in cash or  subject to certain conditions  common stock 
each share of series d preferred currently is convertible into shares of common stock  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
on may   holders of the series d converted  series d preferred shares into  shares of common stock 
at the time of the conversion  we also made a cash payment of million to settle the accrued dividends on the converted shares 
as a result  the shares of series d preferred currently are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the series d preferred is subject to redemption at the option of the holders as follows on or after august  and on or after august  we have had arrangements to sell installments receivable to three financial institutions  general electric capital corporation  bank of america and silicon valley bank 
we sold certain installment contracts for aggregate proceeds of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
as of june   there was approximately million in additional availability under the arrangements 
we expect to continue to have the ability to sell receivables  as the collection of the sold receivables will reduce the outstanding balance  and the availability under the arrangements can be increased 
at june   we had a partial recourse obligation that was within the range of million to million 
in january  we executed a loan arrangement with silicon valley bank 
this arrangement provides a line of credit of up to the lesser of million or of eligible domestic receivables  and a line of credit of up to the lesser of million or of eligible foreign receivables 
the lines of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at june  
we are required to maintain a million compensating cash balance with the bank  or be subject to an unused line fee and collateral handling fees 
the lines of credit will initially be collateralized by nearly all of our assets  and upon achieving certain net income targets  the collateral will be reduced to a lien on our accounts receivable 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum cash balances and an adjusted quick ratio 
as of june   there were million in letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit  and there was million available for future borrowing 
as of june   we were in compliance with the tangible net worth and adjusted quick ratio covenants 
the loan arrangement expires in january we are currently in negotiations to either i extend this line of credit with our current lender and amend the terms of the facility  or ii obtain a facility from another lender 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
our commitments as of june  consisted of capital lease obligations and leases for our headquarters and other facilities 
other than these  there were no other commitments for capital or other expenditures 
our obligations related to these items at june  are as follows in thousands thereafter total operating leases debt obligations total commitments we believe our current cash balances  together with availability of sales of our installment contracts and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least fiscal however  we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
in addition  we may seek to take advantage of favorable market conditions by raising additional funds from time to time through public or private security offerings  debt financings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date and we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact during fiscal new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of fas fin  which clarifies the criteria for recognition and measurement of benefits from uncertain tax positions 
under fin  an entity should recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
the amount to be recognized should be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
furthermore  any change in the recognition  derecognition or measurement of a tax position should be recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs 
we expect to adopt fin as of july   and any change in net assets as a result of applying the interpretation will be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings on that date 
we are in the process of evaluating our uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin item a

the translation of our foreign entities assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 
foreign exchange forward contracts are only obtained to hedge certain customer installments receivable amounts 
foreign exchange hedging we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on customer installments receivable denominated in foreign currencies
