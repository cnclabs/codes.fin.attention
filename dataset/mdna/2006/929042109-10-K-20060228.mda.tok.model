the company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers 
principal factors of competition are rent charged  attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided 
the company s success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national and local economies  financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
economic growth has been fostered  in part  by low interest rates  federal tax cuts  and increases in government spending 
to the extent economic growth stalls  the company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates  higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income  funds from operations and cash flow 
alternatively  if economic growth is sustained  the company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the company s weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income  funds from operations and cash flow 
the company s net income and funds from operations will also be affected by the seasonality of the toys business and competition from discount and mass merchandisers

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  were billion and billion  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and allocates purchase price based on these assessments 
the company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
the company s properties  including any related intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of the company s estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
identified intangible assets upon an acquisition of a business the company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill 
the company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset  including the related real estate when appropriate  is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were  and  respectively 
such amounts are included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the company had  and  of identified intangible liabilities as of december  and  which are included in deferred credit on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
if these assets are deemed to be impaired  or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles assets or liabilities change  the impact to the company s consolidated financial statements could be material 
notes and mortgage loans receivable the company s policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of notes and mortgage loans receivable were  and  respectively 
the company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans  if circumstances warrant  to determine whether it is impaired 
a loan is considered to be impaired  when based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the impact of the company s estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of its loans could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
partially owned entities as of december  and  the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities  including alexander s and toys r us  were  and  respectively 
in determining whether the company has a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  it considers factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  or receive the majority of the expected residual returns  if they occur  or both 
the company accounts for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met  and the company has significant influence over the operations of the investee 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the company s share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions 
investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method 
the company s investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of the company s investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
the company will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  and  as of december  and 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenues income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue 
income is recognized when rooms are occupied 
food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered 
trade show revenues income arising from the operation of trade shows  including rentals of booths 
this revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
temperature controlled logistics revenue income arising from the company s investment in americold logistics 
storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided 
transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers 
management  leasing and other fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities 
this revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
before the company recognizes revenue  it assesses  among other things  its collectibility 
if the company s assessment of the collectibility of its revenue changes  the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements could be material 
income taxes the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  or fails to meet other reit requirements  it may fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result

under this standard  a company must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin became effective in the company s fiscal quarter ended december  certain of the company s real estate assets contain asbestos 
although the asbestos is appropriately contained  in accordance with current environmental regulations  the company s practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties 
accordingly  the company has determined that these assets meet the criteria for recording a liability and has recorded an asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately  which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the cumulative effect of adopting this standard was approximately  and is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in may  the fasb issued sfas no

net income and ebitda by segment for the years ended december   and ebitda represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
management considers ebitda a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity 
as properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of ebitda  management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers 
ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income 
ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the company s statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the control of the company 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
as of december   the company has an interest rate swap as described in footnote to the table below 
management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
the company s exposure to a change in interest rates on its consolidated and non consolidated debt all of which arises out of non trading activity is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts december  balance weighted average interest rate effect of change in base rates december  balance weighted average interest rate consolidated debt variable rate fixed rate pro rata share of debt of non consolidated entities non recourse to the company variable rate before toys r us variable rate of toys r us fixed rate including  of toys debt in minority limited partners share of above total pro forma change in the company s annual net income per share diluted includes  and  respectively  for the company s senior unsecured notes due  as the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate from a fixed rate of to a floating rate of libor plus  based upon the trailing month libor rate at december  
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  accounting for these swaps requires the company to fair value the debt at each reporting period 
at december  and  the fair value adjustment was and  and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above 
the fair value of the company s debt  based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt  exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately  at december  as of december   the company has mezzanine loans receivable of  on which the company receives interest based on a variable rate a fixed spread plus  or day libor 
the company believes that a portion of its exposure to a change in interest rates on its floating rate debt  as illustrated above  is partially mitigated by the outstanding amounts of these loans receivable 
derivative instruments the company has the following derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment upon consummation of the merger between sears and kmart on march   the company s derivative position representing  sears common shares became a derivative position representing  common shares of sears holding valued at  based on the per share closing price on march   the date of the merger  and  of cash 
as a result  the company recognized a net gain of approximately  based on the fair value of the company s derivative position after the exchange of these underlying assets 
because this derivative position does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the company s consolidated statement of income 
for the period from march  through december   the company recorded an expense of  from the derivative position  which consists of i  from the mark to market of the remaining shares in the derivative based on sears holdings closing share price on december   ii  for the net loss on the shares sold based on a weighted average sales price of and iii  resulting primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of libor plus basis points 
during the three months ended september   the company acquired an economic interest in  mcdonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on mcdonalds common shares 
these call and put options have an initial weighted average strike price of per share  or an aggregate of  expire on various dates between july  and september  and provide for net cash settlement 
under the agreement  the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of libor plus basis points up to basis points under certain circumstances and is credited for the dividends received on the shares 
the options provide the company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of libor plus basis points 
because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the company s consolidated statement of income 
during the year ended december   the company recorded net income of  comprised of i  from the mark to market of the options on december   based on mcdonalds closing stock price of per share  ii  of dividend income  partially offset by iii  for the increase in strike price resulting from the libor charge 
under a warrant agreement with gmh communities lp  the company holds million warrants to purchase partnership units of gmh or gct common shares at an adjusted exercise price of per unit or share 
because these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the company s consolidated statement of income 
in the year ended december   the company recorded  of income from the mark to market of these warrants based on gct s closing stock price on the nyse of per share on december
