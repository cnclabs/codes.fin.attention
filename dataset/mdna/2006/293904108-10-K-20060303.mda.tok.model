item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a technology based  product driven biopharmaceutical company that is dedicated to the development  manufacture  and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for patients with cancer and other life threatening diseases 
our primary clinical development and commercial focus is on internally developed or acquired products for oncology and adjacent therapeutic areas where there are serious unmet medical needs 
we also leverage our scientific expertise in designing improved versions of pharmaceuticals to obtain commercialization rights in products discovered by others 
we operate in three business segments products  royalties and contract manufacturing 
products revenues are comprised of sales of four fda approved products  abelcet  adagen  oncaspar  and depocyt 
we receive royalties and license fees on sales of a number of products by other firms that utilize our proprietary pegylation platform  including peg intron r  marketed by schering plough corporation  and macugen r  marketed by osi pharmaceuticals  inc and pfizer inc 
in addition  we utilize contract manufacturing opportunities to broaden our revenue base and enhance our organizational productivity 
presently  we manufacture three injectable pharmaceutical products for our partners 
the following significant events occurred during the six months ended december  o we changed our fiscal year end from june to december this may make period to period comparisons and analysis of growth rates more difficult 
o we changed the definition of and basis of reporting for operating segments from one reportable segment to three as a result of a number of changes in operations  management and performance measures prior year data have been recast to conform to the current presentation 
o we recognized impairment in  and wrote down the carrying amount of  certain intangible assets related to the product abelcet 
o we recognized an impairment in  and wrote off the carrying value of  goodwill 
o we determined that we were unable to continue to reliably estimate royalty revenues based on preliminary data 
as a result  we will now recognize royalty revenue when actual amounts are more reliably known rather than recognizing it on the basis of estimates 
in most cases this will be upon receipt of notification from the third party licensee of royalties earned under the license agreement which is typically in the quarter following the quarter in which the sales occur 
this change has no cash flow effect  but did result in reporting substantially lower royalty income during the quarter ended december  o we adopted  in july  new accounting rules related to expense recognition of share based compensation 
instead of the disclosure of pro forma earnings effects of awarded stock options  beginning in july  the fair value of such awards is being charged to expense as earned 
prior accounting for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards has not been affected significantly  although estimated forfeitures are now factored into current expense recognition rather than when the forfeiture occurs 
as indicated above  effective december   we have changed our fiscal year end from june to december accordingly  this transition report on form k and the discussion that follows relate to the six months ended december  and the three years ended june  throughout the following discussion and analysis  comparisons are made to results of operations for the six months ended december  and balance sheet amounts that existed as of december  this information was derived from our financial information reported on form q and was not audited 
also as indicated above  during the six months ended december   the company changed a number of its internal operations  including its operating structure and performance measures  which resulted in a change in its reportable segments 
we are now managing our business in three segments rather than one 
these segments are products  royalties  and contract manufacturing 
commencing with the quarter ended december  and going forward  we will report revenues and certain expenses by segment 
the discussion that follows is focused on the results of operations by segment  to the extent applicable 
results of operations six months ended december  and and fiscal years ended june    and following are reconciliations of the respective segments profitability to consolidated loss income before income tax on a comparative basis for the periods shown millions of dollars six months ended fiscal year ended december december june june june change change change products segment loss profit nm royalty segment profit contract manufacturing loss profit nm corporate and other expenses loss income before income tax nm nm nm nm not meaningful the company does not allocate certain corporate income and expenses not directly identifiable with the respective segments  including general and administrative expenses  exploratory and preclinical research and development expenses  depreciation  interest income  interest expense and income taxes 
the consolidated results of operations for the six months ended december  were significantly affected by non cash write downs of intangible assets associated with abelcet and goodwill totaling million 
the goodwill write down also had the effect of generating a tax benefit in the amount of million 
the fiscal year ended june  was affected by a large non cash income tax charge of million representing a reserve against the existing deferred tax assets 
these and other fluctuations from year to year are discussed at greater length in the analyses that follow 
products segment segment profitability millions of dollars six months ended fiscal year ended december december june june june change change change revenues cost of sales selling marketing amortization write down of goodwill and intangibles nm segment loss profit nm nm not meaningful revenues performance of individual products is provided below millions of dollars six months ended fiscal year ended december december june june june product change change change abelcet adagen oncaspar depocyt totals net product sales for the six months ended december  decreased by to million over the same period of as growth in the other products could not overcome the decline in us and canadian sales of our intravenous antifungal product  abelcet 
the abelcet sales decline is due to competitive market conditions from both other lipid amphotericin b products and other classes of antifungal products 
during the six months ended december   us and canadian abelcet sales were down million or as compared to the six months ended december  driven mainly by a reduction in volume 
the growth in adagen sales for the six months ended december  as compared to the year earlier period was primarily driven by an increase in the number of patients over the prior year  as well as a higher weighted average price 
the million or increase in revenue for oncaspar was related to the adoption of oncaspar in certain protocols by hospitals and cooperative groups resulting in an increase in demand for the product as well as the effect of a price increase in december depocyt net sales were slightly higher in the most recent six month period compared to the same prior year period due primarily to increased use by neuro oncologists because of its more convenient dosing schedule 
net product sales for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by to million from the year earlier 
the decrease in net product sales was attributable to a decline in us and canadian sales of our intravenous antifungal product  abelcet  due to increasingly competitive market conditions 
during the year ended june   us and canadian abelcet sales declined from the prior year to million 
adagen net sales were million  up over the year ended june  the growth in adagen sales for the year ended june  was primarily driven by an increase in the number of patients over the prior year  as well as a higher weighted average price 
oncaspar net sales increased to million for the year ended june   from million in the twelve month period ended june  due primarily to a higher weighted average price 
depocyt net sales were million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  due primarily to increased demand  which reflects more focused sales and marketing efforts  and to a lesser extent a higher weighted average price 
net product sales for the year ended june  increased by to million  as compared to the year ended june  due to the acquisitions of the us and canadian commercialization rights to abelcet and depocyt during the year ended june   as well as higher sales of oncaspar and adagen 
during the year ended june   us and canadian abelcet sales were million  as compared to million for the year ended june  in november  we acquired the north american abelcet business from elan plc 
net sales of adagen were million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  adagen s growth reflects an increase in the number of patients receiving adagen therapy 
oncaspar net sales increased to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  oncaspar growth was primarily driven by increased demand  which reflects additional sales and marketing efforts to support the product 
in june  we reacquired the north american rights to oncaspar from the sanofi aventis 
depocyt net sales were million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  primarily due to our december acquisition of the us and canadian commercialization rights to depocyt from skyepharma 
since december  a new executive management team has been named and a significant focus is being placed on improving our revenues by supporting our four marketed brands  abelcet  adagen  oncaspar  and depocyt  and expanding their market potential through new initiatives 
despite our efforts  us and canadian sales of abelcet may continue to be negatively impacted by the increasingly competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungal market due to the introduction of newer agents from pfizer  merck  and astellas  as well as increased pricing pressure in the lipid based amphotericin b market 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to support our products will be successful or that any particular sales levels of abelcet  adagen  oncaspar  and depocyt will be achieved or maintained 
cost of sales cost of sales of marketed products for the six months ended december  was million or of sales 
this compared to million or of sales for the comparable six month period of the lower margin earned in the period ended december  was due mainly to an increase in abelcet inventory costs as a result of negative absorption variances arising from low production volumes 
as a result of the quarter ended december impairment write down of abelcet related intangible assets see below  amortization being charged to cost of sales will be lower by million per year having a modest favorable effect on product costs 
for the year ended june   cost of sales was million or of sales 
this was slightly higher than the of sales or million experienced for the year ended june  the percentage increase was attributable to inventory write offs as well as increased capacity costs 
cost of sales as a percent of net product sales  improved to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the decrease was principally due to the higher inventory costs as a result of certain purchase accounting adjustments to the inventory acquired with the abelcet acquisition  which was sold during the year ended june  selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  as well as other commercial expenses and marketing programs to support our sales force 
selling and marketing expenses for the six months ended december  decreased to million  as compared to million for the six months ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the timing of our investments in sales and marketing programs  the absence of spending related to the cancelled marqibo project and the elimination of our canadian sales force 
selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million the year earlier 
the increase in sales and marketing costs was attributable to our oncology sales operations  premarketing expenses regarding marqibo and our hospital based sales operations 
selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to the addition of our us sales force in connection with our acquisition of abelcet and the continued build out of a sales and marketing presence in oncology for oncaspar and depocyt 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization expense was million for the six months ended december   as compared to million for the six months ended december  amortization expense was million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  amortization expense is related to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the abelcet acquisition during november amortization of intangible assets has been provided over their estimated lives ranging from years on a straight line basis 
as a result of the december impairment write down of abelcet related intangible assets see below  amortization expense will be approximately million per year through research and development expenses there has been minimal research and development spending directly related to currently marketed products 
also  the research projects that had been in progress have been terminated and replaced with preclinical programs 
at some point in the future  spending necessary to maintain or expand marketed products may be charged to the products segment 
write down of goodwill and intangible assets the majority of our intangible assets were acquired in november with the acquisition of abelcet 
beginning in late and continuing through  we experienced a decline in sales of abelcet primarily attributable to increased competition in the antifungal market 
abelcet sales have historically averaged approximately million to million per quarter  however in late and into  abelcet sales have declined to approximately million per quarter 
in november  we completed a long term strategic plan that indicates the revenues from sales of abelcet may not recover to historical levels 
in light of this impairment indicator  we engaged an independent valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the abelcet assets and test for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
initial testing disclosed that the future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets were insufficient to cover the carrying value of the abelcet related intangibles 
the fair value of these intangible assets was then calculated and a non cash impairment charge was recognized in the products segment for the excess of carrying amount over fair value in the aggregate amount of million during the six months ended december  effective in the quarter ended december   we changed the manner in which we manage and evaluate the performance of our operations  which resulted in a change to our business segmentation and the identification of our related reporting units 
this new segmentation necessitated the allocation of our existing goodwill to the newly identified reporting units on a relative fair value basis 
further  we considered the historical declining performance of abelcet and the impairment recognized to the related intangible assets to be indicators that our products segment goodwill may be impaired 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform a valuation of our reporting units  to assist us with the allocation of our goodwill and estimate the fair value of assets using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the allocation process resulted in the products segment being assigned million of goodwill 
the ensuing testing to estimate the implied fair value of this goodwill disclosed that it was impaired in its entirety 
accordingly  a non cash impairment loss related to goodwill was recorded in the amount of million in the products segment during the six months ended december  royalties segment millions of dollars six months ended fiscal year ended december december june june june change change change royalty revenue contract revenue total royalties total royalties for the six months ended december  decreased to million as compared to million during the comparable six month period ended december   due primarily to a one quarter deferral of royalty revenue recognition 
the majority of total royalties is comprised of royalty revenue we receive on sales of peg intron  but also includes other royalty revenue  certain license revenues and contract revenues related to the application of our technology to other firms products 
no operating expenses are allocated to the royalties segment 
we have historically been able to reasonably estimate our royalty revenue under our license arrangements principally using historical trends 
however  during recent periods  we have observed greater fluctuations in royalty income estimates under these arrangements 
our ability to estimate third party licensee global net sales and the future royalty payments to be received has become more difficult due to the volatility that has arisen as a result of the expansion in the number of products sold by licensees  the entry of licensees into new geographic territories and the effects of competition on the licensees net sales 
royalties are a material component of total revenues and as the timeline for reporting of financial information shortens  the need for improved estimating procedures has been heightened 
we believe we can no longer reasonably estimate royalty income that we have earned but that has not yet been communicated by the third party licensee 
we recognize royalty revenue when it can reasonably be estimated and collection is reasonably assured  which beginning with the quarter ended december   is the notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement 
this information is generally received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
this change resulted in a one time reduction in royalty revenue for the quarter ended december  royalty revenue that previously would have been recognized in the quarter ended december  will now be recognized upon notification from the third party licensee  which will be in the quarter ending march  this change has no effect on our cash flow 
because of this change  the six month period ended december  represents essentially just one quarter s royalty revenues 
this is principally the royalty received on the sales that occurred during the quarter ended september  of peg intron 
the amount of total royalties reported in the quarter ended september  was million 
the additional total royalties reported for the six months ended december  of million includes fees associated with the discontinuation of the research collaboration with micromet 
in subsequent fiscal years  four full quarters royalty revenue will be reported 
total royalties for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  the improvement in total royalties over the prior year was due to the january launch of macugen in the us for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration amd  an eye disease associated with aging that destroys central vision  and to a lesser extent the december launch of peg intron combination therapy in japan 
under a strategic alliance we formed in with nektar  nektar provides osi pharmaceuticals with pegylation technology for use in macugen and we receive a share of the royalties nektar receives from osi pharmaceuticals 
total royalties for the year ended june  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to increased competition  as well as contracting market conditions 
in december  hoffmann la roche launched a pegylated interferon based combination therapy for hepatitis c that competes directly with schering plough s peg intron combination therapy 
prior to december  peg intron was the only approved pegylated interferon 
due to the december launch of peg intron combination therapy in japan  we believe royalties from sales of peg intron may continue to be positively impacted in the near term 
in september  hoffmann laroche reported that it received fast track review in japan for its pegylated interferon based combination therapy with approval expected in the third quarter of calendar in markets outside of japan  peg intron competes in a highly competitive market that schering plough has reported is contracting 
we cannot assure you that the positive impact of sales of peg intron in japan will offset this market contraction and competitive conditions or that any particular sales levels of peg intron will be achieved or maintained 
costs and expenses current royalty revenues do not require any material specific maintenance costs 
at some point in the future  costs associated with initiation of new outlicensing agreements that could result in our receipt of a royalty stream and  if necessary  costs necessary to maintain the underlying technology may be charged to the royalties segment 
contract manufacturing segment contract manufacturing revenues are comprised of revenues from the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for the european market  and to a lesser extent  the manufacture of an injectable multivitamin  mvi  for mayne 
our contract manufacturing revenue commenced in november  when we entered into a long term manufacturing and supply agreement with elan for the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for the european market in connection with our acquisition of the us and canadian abelcet business 
corporate costs and expenses are not allocated to the segment reporting level 
millions of dollars six months ended fiscal year ended december december june june june product change change change revenues cost of sales nm write down of goodwill nm segment loss profit nm nm not meaningful revenues contract manufacturing revenue for the six months ended december  was million 
this compares to million for the comparable period of the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue was attributable to the timing of sales of mvi offset partially by an increase in our sales of our intravenous antifungal product  abelcet  to the european market 
contract manufacturing revenue for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  during february  elan sold its european sales and marketing business to zeneus pharma  ltd 
zeneus 
transfer of our manufacturing and supply agreement was part of this transaction 
approximately million of the million of contract manufacturing revenue recorded during the year ended june  related to a payment that had not previously been recognized as revenue due to uncertainty about the contractual amount due 
the increase in contract manufacturing revenue in was due to an increase in volume 
cost of sales cost of sales for contract manufacturing for the six months ended december  was million or of sales 
this compared to million or of sales for the comparable six month period of the increase in cost as a percent of sales was attributable to lower production volumes in which resulted in a proportionate increase in fixed costs being allocated to the units produced 
cost of sales for the contract manufacturing segment  as a percentage of net contract manufacturing revenue  decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the decrease was attributable to reduced capacity costs 
cost of sales for contract manufacturing was million or of sales for the year ended june  a favorable effect for the year ended june  of million of contract manufacturing revenue which related to the above referenced payment from elan plc for invoices that had no related cost of sales for the period was more than offset by million of costs related to failed manufacturing batches 
cost of sales for the year ended june  was not reflective of subsequent periods due in part to the fact that the operations began in november with the acquisition of abelcet 
write down of goodwill the contract manufacturing segment was allocated million of goodwill in connection with the redefinition of segments described above in the products segment 
a similar test  as described above  for impairment disclosed that the full amount of goodwill allocated to contract manufacturing was impaired and  accordingly  was written off 
non us revenue we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of million for the six months ended december   million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe  were million  million  million and million  for the six months ended december  and the years ended june   and  respectively

research and development expenses decreased to million for the six months ended december   as compared to million for the six months ended december  the decrease was attributable to decreased costs related to termination of further development of marqibo of approximately million  as well as decreased spending of million related to clinical and preclinical development programs  which was primarily attributable to the termination of our clinical development programs and million related to personnel related expenses 
offsetting these declines  in part  were increased costs of million related to the micromet termination agreement 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to increased costs related to marqibo  which included the impact of a million payment related to the termination of our partnership with inex  as well as increased personnel related expenses 
these increases were offset in part by decreased spending related to clinical and preclinical development programs  which was primarily attributable to the termination of our clinical development program for pegamotecan 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to increased spending related to our antibody collaboration with micromet  our clinical development programs for pegamotecan and a us formulation of atg fresenius s  a partnership with inex for marqibo  preclinical programs  and personnel related expenses 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for the support functions  outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and investor activities  and allocations of facilities costs 
for the six months ended december   general and administrative expenses amounted to million compared to million for the six months ended december  the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased accounting and related fees associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance activities related in part to the change in fiscal year 
in addition  there was an increase in personnel related costs  including employee search fees and relocation expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased accounting and related fees associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance activities  as well as an increase in personnel related costs  including executive level search fees and relocation expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increased salaries  insurance and executive search expenses 
write down of carrying value of investment during the year ended june   we recorded a write down of the carrying value of our investment in micromet that resulted in a non cash charge of million 
in april  we entered into an agreement with micromet  which was amended in june  related to antibody based therapeutics 
in connection with the april agreement  we made an million investment in micromet in the form of a convertible note that was payable to us in march and bore interest at an annual rate of 
this note was convertible into micromet common stock at the election of either party 
our decision to write down the note was based on a decline in the estimated fair value of this investment that was deemed to be other than temporary 
subsequently  in november  we terminated the research collaboration and converted the note into common shares of micromet 
we continue to carry the shares at the written down zero basis of the note 
during the year ended june   we recorded a write down of the carrying value of our investment in nektar that resulted in a non cash charge of million 
as part of our january agreement with nektar  we purchased million of newly issued nektar convertible preferred stock that was convertible into nektar common stock at a conversion price of per share 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  and additional investments 
as a result of a continued decline in the price of nektar s common stock that was determined to be other than temporary  we recorded a write down of the carrying value of our investment in nektar 
the adjustment was calculated based on an assessment of the fair value of the investment at the time of the write down 
subsequently  the preferred shares were converted into nektar common stock and all of this common stock has been sold in january and february see discussion of other income expense below 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development for the six months ended december   of million was attributable to the execution of a license agreement with natimmune in september for the clinical development of recombinant human mannose binding lectin 
mannose binding lectin is a naturally occurring human plasma protein that plays a key role in the immune system s first line defense against infection 
acquired in process research and development for the year ended june  was million 
this expense was attributable to an up front payment that we made to inex related to the execution of a partnership for the clinical development of marqibo 
restructuring charge during the year ended june   we incurred charges totaling million pertaining to a realignment of our costs through a restructuring 
this decision was based on the aforementioned increasingly competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungal market  as well as the discontinuation of certain research and development projects 
the charges were primarily attributable to employee termination benefits 
other income expense other income expense for the six months ended december   the six months ended december   and the year ended june  was an expense of million  million and million  respectively  as compared to income of million for the year ended june  and income of million for the year end june  other income expense includes net investment income  interest expense  and other  net 
other income expense for the year ended june  also included income related to a merger termination fee 
interest expense was million for the six months ended december   million for the six months ended december  and million for each of the years ended june    and interest expense is related to the convertible subordinated notes  which were outstanding for each of the periods 
net investment income for the six months ended december  increased by million to million  as compared to million for the six months ended december  this increase was principally due to the increase in interest income in our interest bearing investments 
net investment income for the year ended june  decreased by million to million  as compared to million for the year ended june  this decrease was principally due to the prior year s sale of  shares of nektar therapeutics common stock that resulted in the net gain of approximately million  recorded during the year ended june  this decrease in investment income was partially offset by a million increase in interest income for the year ended june   as compared to the year ended june  net investment income for the year ended june  increased by million to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to a net realized gain of million principally related to the sale of approximately of our investment in nektar 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in our interest bearing investments as a result of the previous year s purchase of the us and canadian rights to abelcet in november for a cash payment of million plus acquisition costs  as well as a decrease in interest rates 
during the year ended june   we recorded nps merger termination income of million 
this amount reflects the aggregate consideration of million we received from nps in the form of nps common stock related to the termination of our proposed merger with nps in june net of million in costs incurred related to the proposed merger with nps primarily investment banking  legal  and accounting fees 
other  net is primarily related to the million shares of nps common stock we received under a june merger termination agreement and a financial instrument we entered into to reduce our exposure to the change in fair value associated with such shares  specifically a zero cost protective collar arrangement the collar 
for the six months ended december   other  net was an expense of million compared to an expense of million for the comparable prior year period 
for the year ended june   other  net was an expense of million  as compared to income of million for the year ended june  during each of the six month periods ended december  and  the company sold  shares of nps common stock it held and  shares of the collar instrument matured 
this resulted in the recognition of losses of million and million as components of other income expense for the six month periods ended december  and  respectively 
the company received cash proceeds from the settlement of the collar totaling million in each of the six month periods 
during the year ended june   we realized a loss of million related to the sale and repurchase of  shares of nps common stock  an unrealized gain of million related to change in the fair value of the collar  and a realized loss of million related to the maturation of a portion of the collar and the sale of the underlying shares 
these amounts were partially offset by other miscellaneous non operating income of million for the year ended june  for the year ended june   other income was million 
during the year ended june   we recognized an unrealized gain of million related to the change in the fair value of our nps common stock a realized gain of million related to the sale and repurchase of million shares of nps common stock  and an unrealized gain of million related to change in the fair value of the collar 
there was million of other miscellaneous non operating income for the year ended june  for a more detailed description of our merger termination agreement with nps and the collar see note to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements merger termination agreement 
income taxes for the six months ended december   we recognized a non cash net tax benefit of approximately million for federal and state purposes  as compared to a net tax benefit of million for the six months ended december  income tax benefit for the six months ended december  is primarily the result of the company s write off of goodwill 
a deferred tax liability had been accreting due to goodwill being amortized for tax purposes but not for books 
this deferred tax liability is now converted into a deferred tax asset against which a valuation allowance was established 
also  during the six months ended december   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carryforwards not expected to be useable by us for proceeds of million which was recorded as a tax benefit and we recorded state tax expense of million and foreign tax expense of million 
during the year ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million  which represents a full reserve against our existing net deferred tax assets of million  a deferred tax liability charge of million associated with our goodwill  as well as a million income tax provision for the twelve months ended june  this charge was determined based on our assessment of the likelihood that we will benefit from these assets 
realizing a benefit is ultimately dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax benefits that are recognized as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
based on an analysis of the continued decline in our abelcet revenues  coupled with projected continuing funding of research and development  we determined that it was not more likely than not that we would realize the tax benefits attributable to our deferred tax assets 
for the year ended june  we recognized a net tax expense of approximately million for federal and state purposes  as compared to net tax expense of million for the year ended june  income tax expense for the year ended june  is comprised of a tax provision for income taxes payable and a charge of million primarily related to an increase in our valuation allowance for certain research and development tax credits and capital losses based on our assessment that it was not more likely than not that we would be able to utilize these assets 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carryforwards for proceeds of million which was recorded as a tax benefit and we purchased approximately million of gross state net operating loss carryforwards for million 
for the year ended june   we recognized net tax expense of approximately million 
certain tax expense  primarily related to the nps settlement in june  was offset by the reduction in the valuation allowance based on our net operating loss carryforwards expected to be utilized in the future 
we believed it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  and we therefore recognized million of net deferred tax assets 
of these assets  approximately million related to net operating losses from stock option exercises which  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital and not as a credit to income tax expense 
the remaining benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance totaled million and was recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately million of our state net operating loss carryforwards for proceeds of million which was recorded as a tax benefit and we purchased approximately million of gross state net operating loss carryforwards for million 
liquidity and capital resources total cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents short term investments  and marketable securities  as of december  were million  as compared to million as of june  the increase in cash reserves is the result of net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from the sale of equity securities  primarily related to the sale of  shares of nps common stock which resulted in cash proceeds of million offset by a million payment to natimmune for the execution of a license agreement 
during the six months ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for the six months ended december   down principally due to lower earnings 
the reported net loss for the six months ended december  of million  adjusted for non cash items such as write downs of goodwill and intangibles impairments depreciation and amortization aggregating million  indicates a positive contribution to cash flows from operations of approximately million 
net changes in operating assets and liabilities of million and excluding the loss of million on the sale of an equity investment comprise the balance 
net operating asset changes include a significant reduction in accounts receivable due to the absence of royalty revenue in the quarter 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended december  was derived primarily from the reported net loss for the period of million adjusted for non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization totaling approximately million

critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
during the six months ended december   accounting policies and estimates related to revenue recognition  share based payments  fair value of long lived assets and goodwill impairment had particular significance to our financial statements and results of operations 
royalty revenue recognition will no longer be estimated based on historical trends 
new accounting policies relating to share based payments were adopted effective july   whereby assumptions relating to the volatility of enzon stock price and option forfeiture rates  among others  will have an effect on compensation expense 
independent valuations were performed of abelcet related intangible assets that involved numerous assumptions and estimates including future cash flows and discount rates 
as a result of a change in segments  goodwill was allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment which also involved an independent valuation study 
each of these accounting policies and the estimates employed is discussed below 
revenues revenues from product sales and contract manufacturing revenue are recognized when title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
for product sales we also recorded a provision at the time of shipment for estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discounts  rebates and returns 
these sales provision accruals  except for rebates which are recorded as a liability  are presented as a reduction of the accounts receivable balances 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the accruals by comparing the actual payments to the estimates used in establishing the accruals 
the majority of our net product sales are to wholesale distributors who resell the products to the end customers 
we provide chargeback payments to these distributors based on their sales to members of buying groups at prices determined under a contract between enzon and the member 
administrative fees are paid to buying groups based on the total amount of purchases by their members 
we estimate the amount of the chargeback that will be paid using a channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers  which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel  and b historical trends  adjusted for current changes 
the settlement of the chargebacks generally occurs within three months after the sale to the wholesaler 
we regularly analyze the historical chargeback trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends 
in addition  state agencies that administer various programs  such as the us medicaid programs  receive rebates 
medicaid rebates and administrative fees are recorded as a liability and a reduction of gross sales when we record the sale of the product 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we use a channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers  which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel  b our historical medicaid rebate and administrative fee payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales  and c any significant changes in sales trends 
current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  and the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid patients are also evaluated 
factors that complicate the rebate calculations are the timing of the average manufacturer pricing computation  the lag time between sale and payment of a rebate  which can range up to nine months  and the level of reimbursement by state agencies 
the following is a summary of reductions of gross sales accrued as of december  and june  in thousands december  june  accounts receivable reductions chargebacks   cash discounts other including returns  total   accrued liabilities medicaid rebates   administrative rebates total   we have inventory management agreements with three of our major wholesalers 
these agreements provide that the wholesalers maintain inventory levels at no more than six selling weeks 
during the six months ended december   we decreased our distribution channel estimate to reflect the wholesaler inventory levels 
this resulted in an million reduction to our chargeback estimates and a favorable effect on operating income for the six months ended december  royalties under our license agreements with third parties are recognized when reasonably estimable and earned through the sale of the product by the licensee net of future credits  chargebacks  sales discount rebates and refunds and collection is reasonably assured 
we have historically been able to reasonably estimate our royalty revenue under our license arrangements principally using historical trends 
however  during recent periods  we have observed greater fluctuations in royalty income estimates under these arrangements 
our ability to estimate third party licensee global net sales and the future royalty payments to be received has become more difficult due to the volatility that has arisen as a result of the expansion in the number of products sold by licensees  the entry of licensees into new geographic territories and the effects of competition on the licensees net sales 
royalties are a material component of our total revenues and as the timeline for reporting of financial information shortens  the need for improved estimating procedures has been heightened 
we believe we can no longer reasonably estimate royalty income that we have earned but that has not yet been communicated by the third party licensee 
beginning with the quarter ended december   notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement will be the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information is generally received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
this change resulted in a one time reduction in royalty revenue for the quarter ended december  royalty revenue that previously would have been recognized in the quarter ended december  will now be recognized upon notification from the third party licensee  which will be in the quarter ending march  contract revenues  which include fees and royalties received from third parties using our technology  are recorded as the earnings process is completed 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned  upon the occurrence of contract specified events and when the milestone has substance 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we believe that it is not more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  based on future operations 
long lived asset and goodwill impairment analysis long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this testing is performed when impairment indicators are present 
we test for impairment of goodwill at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
more frequent analysis is performed whenever impairment indicators suggest the need for it 
impairment indicators are events or circumstances that may be indicative of possible impairment such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  a current period operating loss combined with a history of operating losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  asset group or reporting unit 
sfas no 
testing for the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is performed initially by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flow stream exceeds the carrying amount  no further analysis is required 
however  if this test shows a negative relationship  the fair value of the intangible assets must be estimated and we would record an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we determined in the december quarter of  while effecting the change in reporting segments and as the current management team was completing its long term strategic planning process  that an impairment indicator existed regarding the product abelcet 
an independent valuation firm was engaged to perform undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses to assess whether or not there was an impairment and  if so  the measure of the write down 
this process required a number of estimates and assumptions including future revenues and expenses  growth rates and discount rates 
an impairment write down was recorded in connection with the testing outlined above 
see note to the accompanying financial statements 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization but must be tested at least annually for impairment 
the impairment test involves first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as would occur in a purchase transaction treating the fair value of the reporting unit as the equivalent of the purchase price and deducting from that the fair values of tangible and intangible assets assigned to the reporting unit 
this process requires a number of estimates and assumptions including future revenues and expenses  growth rates and discount rates 
effective in the quarter ended december   we changed the basis upon which we report our business segments 
this necessitated the allocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis to the newly identified reporting units and the performance of impairment tests at that level 
an independent valuation firm was engaged to perform valuations of the reporting units  allocate goodwill and estimate the fair value of assets using discounted cash flow analyses 
goodwill was allocated to the products and contract manufacturing segments 
no goodwill was allocated to the royalties segment as  by the nature of the segment s operations  goodwill would not naturally be associated with it 
the allocation process resulted in the products reporting unit being assigned million of goodwill and the contract manufacturing reporting unit receiving million 
the ensuing testing to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill within each of the reporting units disclosed that the goodwill was impaired in its entirety 
accordingly  an impairment loss related to goodwill was recognized in the amount of million in the consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended december  cost method investments we assess the carrying value of our cost method investments in accordance with sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
commencing with the first quarter of the year ended june  the company began evaluating its investments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an impairment write down is recorded when a decline in the value of an investment is determined to be other than temporary 
these determinations involve a significant degree of judgment and are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 
share based payments effective july   the company adopted sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  measured by the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
until we have developed sufficient reliable enzon specific information  we are using an industry average for purposes of estimating forfeitures of share based payments 
as stratified data are developed  they will be compared to the initial average and the rate will be adjusted  as deemed necessary 
the effect of adoption of sfas r was not material to the six months ended december  it is expected  however  that the new rules will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share in future periods as future share based payments are charged to operating expense 
the impact such payments will have on results of operations will be a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price of the company s stock at date of grant 
options or stock awards issued to non employees and consultants are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and recognized over the related vesting or service period 
fair value of share based payments is determined using the black scholes valuation model which employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of the company s stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on historical enzon stock price information 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method which requires that compensation costs be recorded  as earned  for all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding at june  in april  the board of directors accelerated the vesting of all of the company s out of the money unvested stock options awarded to directors  officers and employees and  in june  the board of directors accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options granted in may and june to company officers 
this acceleration resulted in our not being required to recognize aggregate compensation expense of approximately million over the succeeding months million in the six months ended december  
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of months 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
statement changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
apb opinion no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in an accounting principle be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
now requires retrospective application of changes in an accounting principle to prior period financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement will not have an immediate material impact on our financial statements although the accounting change that would trigger its future implementation may be material 
in november  the fasb staff issued staff position fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this document addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the staff essentially reaffirms previous guidance relating to impairment of debt and equity securities and nullifies certain requirements of eitf issue of the same title 
the guidance in fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  our management does not anticipate the new guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
disclosure requirements of eitf carried forward into fsp have been effective since july forward looking information and factors that may affect future results throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have disclosed forward looking information in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments 
by their nature  forward looking statements are subject to numerous events and circumstances that may influence outcomes or events prevent their occurrence 
such factors may be external to the company and entirely outside its control 
certain risks and uncertainties are listed below 
it is not possible  however to predict or identify all such factors 
accordingly  you should not consider the examples set forth below to be complete 
the risk that o we will continue to experience operating losses for the next several years o there will be a decline in sales of one or more of our marketed products or products sold by others from which we derive royalty revenues or license fees 
such sales declines could result from increased competition  loss of patent protection  pricing and or regulatory constraints 
o we will not achieve success in our research and development efforts including clinical trials conducted by us or by our collaborative partners 
o we will be unable to obtain critical compounds used in the manufacture of our products 
o we or one of our key suppliers will experience manufacturing problems or delays 
o we will fail to obtain adequate financing to meet our future capital and financing needs 
o key personnel will leave the company 
o our research and development activities will fail to yield new marketed products 
we cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations expressed in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations will be correct 
failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and from those results anticipated or projected 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements 
more detailed risk factors in item a  part i of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of equity and debt securities  time deposits and auction rate securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum  and at december  all of our holdings were in instruments maturing in four years or less
