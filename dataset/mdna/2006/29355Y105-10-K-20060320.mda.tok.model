item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a medical products company engaged in designing  developing  manufacturing and marketing of percutaneous vessel introducers  implantable stimulation leads  steerable catheter delivery systems  and accessories for the cardiac rhythm management crm  neuromodulation and interventional radiology markets and manufacturing of medical devices and components for other medical product companies on a contract basis 
on october   we completed our acquisition of the operating assets of biomec cardiovascular inc bci from biomec inc 
and began to operate the bci business through our wholly owned subsidiary  enpath lead technologies  inc elt 
we paid million less assumed liabilities of approximately million plus a working capital adjustment of  in addition  we made a contingent payment of million on march   based on the final sales results of the acquired bci business 
we also made a second contingent payment of  on march   based on the increase in proprietary sales in over see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further details 
during  enpath medical  inc operated as two divisions the enpath delivery systems division eds  formerly medamicus  inc and the enpath lead technologies division elt  formerly bci 
the two divisions were aggregated into one reportable segment the manufacture and sale of medical devices 
the divisions had similar technology  manufacturing  customers and regulatory activities and we combined our sales and marketing and research and development activities to take advantage of similarities in customers and synergies within product development 
effective january   the divisional structure was eliminated and we now operate as one organization located in two facilities 
on march   our wholly owned elt subsidiary was merged into enpath medical  inc summary financial information for the past years is shown below

vessel introducers enable physicians to create a conduit through which they can insert infusion catheters  implantable ports and pacemaker leads into a blood vessel 
in addition to the traditional core introducer product line  we have developed and manufacture advanced steerable catheters that have a fixed curve or an articulating distal tip section that can be manipulated to enable the health care professional to access parts of the patient s anatomy such as the left ventricle of the heart that cannot be reached by traditional introducers 
these sophisticated advanced delivery catheters are designed and manufactured to meet the unique needs of each procedure being performed 
in reviewing our financial results  we will discuss variations in sales and gross profit from introducers  advanced delivery steerable catheters  safety needles  contract manufacturing and engineering services and combine them under the product line delivery systems since they are developed and manufactured in the same facility 
we also develop and manufacture proprietary and custom designed implantable stimulation leads  adapters and delivery systems for the cardiac and neuromodulation markets 
in reviewing our financial results  we will discuss variations in sales and gross profit from leads  adapters and delivery systems proprietary products  contract manufacturing and engineering services and combine them under the product line lead technologies since they are developed and manufactured in the same facility 
results of operations delivery systems   and a summary of our delivery system net sales and gross profits is shown below 
sales in thousands introducer advanced delivery safety contract engineering other total sales percent sales change to to introducer advanced delivery safety contract engineering other total percent sales change gross profits in thousands gross profit as of sales sales of our introducer products increased slightly from to primarily due to sales patterns stabilizing after the flowguard valved introducer launch ramp up in sales of our core introducer products increased from to primarily due to the launch of the flowguard valved introducer into the cardiac pacemaker market which included a large initial stocking order  as well as strong orders for introducers from our two largest customers during the last half of we are anticipating that our introducer product sales will increase in as we continue to add new introducer customers  as well as launch our next generation flowguard product to the pacing market sometime in the third quarter 
sales of our advanced delivery products decreased from to  primarily due to continued declining component and kit sales to medtronic for their left ventricle lead delivery system lvlds as medtronic continues to integrate this product line into its own facility 
this product line was million of revenue in when medtronic informed us of its plan to move the product line in house  and has declined to the point where it is no longer a material to our overall revenue 
we began selling small quantities of our new steerable catheter to bard ep late in and we expect sales of this product to ramp up in as bard penetrates the marketplace 
we continue our efforts with several oem customers on sophisticated delivery catheters that will have utility in the treatment of atrial fibrillation  percutaneous mitral valve repair  carotid stent placement  and a variety of renal and peripheral interventions 
each of these delivery catheters is based on our proprietary technology and could potentially be used in new treatments being developed which involve large patient populations 
some of our partners are further along than others and on track to bring their therapeutic devices to market sometime in we expect advanced delivery catheter product sales to increase in as our customers begin to launch their new devices into the marketplace with our delivery products 
sales of our safety needle products have continued to decline since and we took an impairment charge of million in on our safety needle assets 
we have made the decision to phase out this product line and are currently looking at possible buyers for this product line see note of the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information 
engineering service other sales can fluctuate greatly from year to year  based on the number of engineering service projects that we decide to take on 
in all cases  the projects that we take on are intended to provide future revenue because we contract with the parties to become the manufacturer of the finished product for the customer 
in  we took on a greater number of these projects  primarily in the advanced delivery catheter product arena with the expectation of building these sales in and beyond 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased in compared to primarily due to the decrease in sales of high margin components and kits to medtronic for its lvlds product line 
we also incurred ramp up costs as we increased production capabilities for our advanced steerable introducer manufacturing 
gross profit as a percent of sales increased in compared to primarily due to the resolution of several issues that impacted these issues included the recall of the flowguard product due to resin issues that were resolved and the high levels of depreciation and amortization on our safety needle assets related to the sales of safety needles which were in place in before we recorded the impairment charge in june we expect our gross margins as a percent of sales to improve in as we stabilize our advanced steerable introducer manufacturing processes  as well as utilize more of our excess overhead with increased sales 
lead technologies  and a summary of our lead technology net sales and gross profits is shown below 
because we did not acquire the assets of bci until october   the numbers shown for only cover the period from october to the end of the year 
sales in thousands proprietary products contract engineering other total sales percent sales change to to proprietary products contract engineering other total percent sales change gross profits in thousands gross profit as of sales sales of proprietary products  consisting of implantable stimulation leads  lead delivery systems and adaptors decreased in compared to  primarily due to decreased sales of our myopore epicardial lead to several of our oem partners 
we had hoped to launch our new myopore rx steroid epicardial lead at the beginning of  but because of the fda s decision to require human clinical data in order to receive approval for this product  our partners have slowed their purchasing of myopore epicardial leads until there is some final resolution to the situation 
one of our partners is selling the steroid lead in europe with success and we expect increased orders for this product in this partner also started successfully selling the fastac flex delivery tool in europe late in and plans to launch the fastac flex in the us in the second quarter of sales of proprietary products increased in compared to  primarily due to including only months sales from in our financial statements 
we expect to see growth in our proprietary product sales in primarily due to continued growth in sales of the steroid lead in europe  as well as the launch of our fastac flex delivery tool for improved efficiency when placing the epicardial lead in both europe and in the us sales of contract manufacturing products  consisting primarily of lead accessories  increased in compared to due to increased sales of stylet kits to one of our oem partners 
stylets are used to assist the physician in guiding a pacing lead to the correct location during surgery 
this partner had an overstock situation that led to lower sales in  but this inventory situation has been resolved 
sales of contract manufacturing products increased in compared to  primarily due to including only two months of sales in our results 
we expect that contract manufacturing sales in will increase slightly compared to as we continue to shift our focus to proprietary products 
engineering service other sales can fluctuate greatly from year to year  based on the number of engineering service projects that we elect to contract 
in all cases  the projects that we contract are intended to provide future revenue because we partner with the oem customer to become the manufacturer of the finished product 
in  we accepted a larger volume of these projects  primarily in the proprietary product area  with the expectation of creating manufacturing activity in and beyond 
we expect engineering service sales to be slightly lower in gross profit as a percent of sales increased in over primarily due to the elimination of several low margin contract manufacturing products during gross profit as a percent of sales decreased in over primarily due to the low level of sales during the year  which resulted in a significant portion of our overhead not being allocated to production 
we expect to continue to see gross margin improvement in as we continue to grow our proprietary sales and more efficiently utilize our manufacturing overhead 
combined expenses  and combined expenses in thousands research development sales marketing general administrative interest income interest expense other total shared expenses percent of sales research development sales marketing general administrative interest income interest expense other total sales in thousands combined expenses exclude a million safety needle impairment charge 
combined expenses exclude a million write off of purchased in process research and development expenses 
research and development research and development expenses have increased in both spending and as a percentage of sales since the increase in over was due to the strategic decision to expand our product line by developing a proprietary platform around advanced steerable catheters 
the development work on this platform increased during as we began to incorporate this technology into therapeutic devices for various companies 
in addition  in early we began the process of preparing the information and conducting tests to be able to file our submission with the fda to gain marketing clearance for our steroid lead 
when the fda determined that it was going to require human clinical data in order to grant clearance  we appealed that decision which resulted in substantial legal and consulting costs in the large increase in spending in over was primarily due to inclusion of the stimulation lead expenses for all of compared to only two months in we plan on spending slightly more on research and development activities in compared to and expect these expenses to be approximately of sales as we continue our efforts to develop and launch new products 
in the future our long term objective is to spend approximately of our sales on research and development activities 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased in compared to  primarily due to lower salaries and advertising costs 
we also spent more on advertising in as we introduced our new enpath corporate name and brand identity to the marketplace 
the large increase in over was primarily due to inclusion of the elt expenses for all of compared to only two months in we plan on spending more on sales and marketing activities in compared to and expect sales and marketing expenses to be approximately of sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged  both from a dollar standpoint  as well as a percent of sales standpoint in over the large increase in over was primarily due to including the elt expenses for all of compared to only months in we plan on spending more on general and administrative activities in compared to  including expenses associated with accounting for stock based compensation and sarbanes oxley compliance 
we expect general and administrative expenses to total approximately of sales 
other expenses interest income was   and  and interest expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
interest income decreased primarily due to lower cash balances resulting from the use of excess cash to fund the acquisition of bci in interest expense increased primarily due to the interest on the million note payable that was put in place in october to help fund the bci acquisition  as well as interest payments on our line of credit borrowings 
other income in was primarily due to a gain of approximately  from selling off the majority of our laser contract manufacturing business and equipment in the fourth quarter of income taxes we determined the amount of prior year research and development tax credits and have claimed or received refunds of taxes paid  and as a result were able to record an additional tax benefit of  in the fourth quarter of we expect that our overall state and federal tax rate for will approximate 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had no unrestricted cash and cash equivalents compared to  as of december  net cash provided by operating activities during was million  consisting primarily of net income of  adjusted for non cash items of depreciation and amortization of million  gain on disposal of equipment of  and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of  these increases were offset in part by the net change in our deferred tax benefit of  net cash used in investing activities during was million  consisting primarily of the purchase of equipment totaling million  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment totaling  additions to intangible assets totaling  and the final cash payment for the bci acquisition of  net cash used in financing activities during was million 
we made principal payments on capital leases of  payments on our note payable to bank of million and payments on our line of credit of  this was offset by proceeds from option exercises of  on october   we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five year term loan of million  which was used to finance a portion of the bci acquisition  and a million line of credit 
the bank subsequently raised our line of credit to million in april and the entire line of credit was available for use at december  the borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis 
the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends without the consent of the lender 
at december   we were in violation of certain of these covenants 
these violations were subsequently waived by the bank on february  payments on the term loan consist of monthly principal payments of  plus interest at libor plus 
these payments commenced in november the line of credit bears interest at libor plus with no minimum interest due and expires on april  the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
there were no borrowings under the line of credit at december  as of december   our working capital was million  or a current ratio of to  compared to working capital of million or a current ratio of to as of december  accounts receivable increased  primarily due to the timing of sales as overall collections have remained constant at approximately days during both and we had no cash as of december  primarily due to the fact that we paid off the entire line of credit balance of million during the fourth quarter 
in order to minimize interest expense  we will continue to maintain a small cash balance when we utilize our line of credit 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total long term debt  including interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations we also have a commercial commitment as described below other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at december  date of expiration line of credit april  while we believe that we have sufficient resources with our current cash and credit facility to meet our long term debt obligations and fund our planned operations for fiscal  there is no assurance that we will not need additional capital in the future 
sources of additional capital may include additional debt financing or the sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain additional capital on favorable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation and accelerated vesting we have four stock option plans the incentive stock option plan  the non qualified plan  the non employee director and medical advisory board stock option plan and the incentive stock option plan 
summary information related to these plans as of december  is shown below available plan reserved granted forfeited exercised outstanding to grant incentive plan non qualified plan non employee director plan incentive plan totals we account for these plans under apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income loss  as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we also grant options and warrants to non employees for goods and services and in conjunction with certain agreements 
these grants are accounted for under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
based on the grant date fair values 
in december  fasb published statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r or the statement 
fas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
fas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
fas r is a replacement of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb  and its related interpretive guidance 
this statement will require entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award  and to recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide services for the award 
fas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
we will be required to apply fas r beginning in the first quarter of fas r allows two methods for determining the effects of the transition the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective method of transition 
we will adopt the modified prospective transition method beginning in the pro forma compensation costs presented previously and in our prior filings have been calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of amounts which should be expected in future years 
on april   our board of directors took action to accelerate vesting of all outstanding employee stock options 
as of that date  we had a total of  employee options outstanding  of which  were vested and  were unvested 
the board accelerated the vesting schedule of the  unvested employee options  of which  were underwater and  were in the money 
unvested options that were granted to board members were not subject to the accelerated vesting 
summary information related to these options is shown below employees total vested unvested underwater options in the money options total options this action was taken to eliminate approximately million in compensation expense that we would otherwise have incurred over four years beginning in  upon the adoption of fas r 
we also determined that no compensation expense needed to be booked for the  in the money options that were unvested due to the high likelihood of continued employment of the individuals involved  as well as the short remaining period less than one year to full vesting 
the board of directors has examined our method of compensating employees and board members through equity awards 
the board has determined that future equity compensation will primarily consist of restricted stock awards with stock option awards being made only at the officer and board level 
in the case of these stock option awards  we intend to use the black scholes option pricing model 
on april   our shareholders approved amendments to the enpath medical  inc non employee director and medical advisor board plan and the incentive stock option plan to allow for the issuance of restricted stock awards 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
our management analyzes accounts receivable  historical write offs as bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debt expense and our reserve for doubtful accounts of  should be adequate for any exposure to loss in our december  accounts receivable 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory inventories  which are composed of purchased parts and subassemblies  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or slow moving inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
we have established a reserve for excess and slow moving inventories and believe the reserve of  at december  is adequate 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets including intangible assets with finite lives as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment of finite life assets requires us to make estimates of the fair value of our long lived assets  primarily based on projected future cash flows using discount rates determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model or another valuation technique 
for goodwill  we determine whether the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if we determine that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  we will reduce the valuation of these assets on our financial statements 
significant intangible assets include the following goodwill the estimate of the fair value of the goodwill that resulted from our acquisition of bci and the annual impairment test of this asset are significant estimates and require judgment relative to valuation  future cash flows  and market capitalization of the applicable business unit as well as other matters including the recorded balance of approximately million 
safety needle the estimate of the fair value of our investment in the license agreement and manufacturing equipment related to the safety needle aggregate net balance of  at december  is primarily dependent upon locating an appropriate buyer for our automated equipment and licensed technology 
while we are continuing to sell approximately  worth of safety needles each quarter  we are planning to phase out of this product line in the future 
we are currently looking at possible buyers for this product line and we expect to fully realize the adjusted investment we have remaining in the safety needle license  inventory and equipment 
however  if we are not able to find a buyer for this product line and actual sales drop off dramatically  our adjusted investment in this product totaling approximately  assets plus inventory at december  may not be fully realizable in the future see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
other intangibles with finite lives other intangibles with finite lives consist primarily of purchased technology  trade name  patents  customer relationships and trademarks aggregate net balance of million at december  are being amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
allocation of purchase price paid for the bci acquisition as a result of our acquisition of bci  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k we were required to allocate the consideration paid for bci between tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development ipr d  and goodwill 
the value assigned to ipr d was determined by identifying those acquired specific in process research and development projects that would be continued and for which a technological feasibility had not been established at the acquisition date  b there was no alternative future use  and c the fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability 
we were required to make significant estimates to determine the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of the intangible assets 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets was determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rates used in calculating the present value of the various intangibles were in accordance with accepted valuation methods and for ipr d also included the consideration of the risks of not achieving commercial feasibility 
the goodwill that resulted from this acquisition represents the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the total tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
in process research and development ipr d development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use were classified as in process research and development 
the purchase price assigned to those projects was immediately expensed on the acquisition date and was reflected as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the in process research and development projects were as follows steroid leads million  adapters million and an implant tool 
the estimated value of these projects was determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the discount rates used considered the stage of completion and the risk surrounding the successful development and commercialization of each of the purchased in process technology projects 
some of the original assumptions related to these projects were as follows initial assumptions october  category leads tool adaptor costs incurred as of estimated cost to complete percent complete dollars months spent up to estimated months to complete percent complete months year revenues estimated to begin regulatory approval received no no no the discount rates used in valuing the developed  core and in process technologies ranged from to 
a higher discount rate was used to value the in process research and development  due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process projects  fda approval  and the market acceptance of the products 
the percentage of completion for each of the in process projects was determined using costs incurred to date on each project as compared to the remaining estimated costs to be incurred to bring each of the projects to technological feasibility 
we believe that the three in process projects described above either have or will reach technological feasibility 
however  because of the risks associated with the commercial viability of these products  there can be no assurance that these projects will actually achieve commercialization 
these risks include the delay or failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or the failure to achieve market acceptance 
we have received european approval to begin selling the steroid lead through one oem partner  but we do not anticipate fda approval on this lead anytime soon 
we also have fda and european approval to begin selling the fastac flex tool 
updated information related to these three projects is summarized below status on december  category leads tool adaptor costs incurred as of estimated cost to complete percent complete dollars months spent up to estimated months to complete percent complete months year revenues estimated to begin regulatory approval received fda no yes no european yes yes no approval for one partner if one or more of our oem partners decide to move forward with human clinical trials for the steroid lead in order to obtain fda approval  additional costs would be incurred 
in october  we entered into an exclusive arrangement under which we will develop and supply is adaptors for a major crm company 
as a result of this agreement  we have reduced the total dollar estimates we will spend on the adaptor project 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r or the statement 
fas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
fas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
fas r is a replacement of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretive guidance apb 
the effect of the statement will be to require entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award  and to recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide services for the award 
fas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
we will be required to apply fas r for our quarter ending march  fas r allows two methods for determining the effects of the transition the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective method of transition 
we will adopt the modified prospective transition method beginning in the pro forma compensation costs presented in our prior filings have been calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of amounts which should be expected in future years 
our board has determined that future equity compensation will primarily consist of restricted stock awards with stock option awards being made at the officer and board level only 
in the case of these stock option awards  we intend to use the black scholes option pricing model 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb statement no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred by us in in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb statement no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement will be effective for non monetary asset exchanges by us in in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
this statement will be effective for us in in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb published fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred  generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation will be effective for us in forward looking statements statements included in this annual report on form k  in the letter to shareholders  in our quarterly reports  in filings by us with the securities and exchange commission  in our press releases  and oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer that are not historical or current facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain important factors could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of these statements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity 
our earnings have not been materially affected by changes in interest rates on our floating interest rate debt less than  for because interest rates remained fairly stable during the year and we utilized our line of credit modestly 
based on our current borrowings and anticipated line of credit requirements in  an increase of basis points in prevailing interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by less than
