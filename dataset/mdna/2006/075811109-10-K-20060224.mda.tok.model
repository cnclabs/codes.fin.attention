we serve customers across the biomedical testing continuum by designing  developing  manufacturing  selling and supporting the complex systems that customers use in their laboratories 
our products consist of instruments  chemistries  software and supplies that meet a variety of biomedical laboratory needs 
our products are used in a range of applications  from lab solutions used for pioneering medical research  clinical research and drug discovery to diagnostic systems found in hospitals and physicians offices to aid in patient care 
we compete in a market segment that we estimate totaled approximately billion in annual worldwide sales 
we currently have products that address approximately half of that market 
we market our products in more than countries  with approximately of revenues in coming from sales outside the united states 
our product lines include virtually all blood tests routinely performed in hospital laboratories and a range of systems for medical and pharmaceutical research 
we have more than  systems operating in laboratories around the world 
our instruments are generally provided to customers under either operating type lease otl arrangements  sales type lease stl arrangements or cash sales 
many of our lease arrangements take the form of what are known as reagent rentals where an instrument is placed at a customer location and the customer commits to purchase a certain minimum volume of reagents annually 
we also enter into metered contracts with customers where the instrument is placed at a customer location with a stock of reagents 
the customer is then billed monthly based on actual usage of reagents 
in the second quarter of  we reviewed our leasing policies and decided to emphasize lease contracts with terms that are expected to result in more otls 
this shift to otls began in the third quarter of  and mostly impacted the united states us 
by the fourth quarter of  the majority of our new leases in the us were otls 
approximately and of our and revenues  respectively  came from after market customer purchases of operating supplies  chemistry kits and service 
our large installed base provides us with a significant competitive advantage and drives this profitable stream of aftermarket consumables and service 
our strategy is to extend the company s leadership in simplifying  automating and innovating customer s processes  by continuing to rollout new products  enhancing our current product offerings  and entering into new and growing market segments 
placements of products serving the clinical diagnostics markets chemistry systems  immunoassay systems  the majority of products within cellular systems and some of the products within discovery and automation systems have been experiencing growth as test volumes continue to increase as a result of factors such as an aging population  increasing expenditures on chronic diseases  conditions requiring ongoing treatment for example  diabetes  aids and cancer and greater acceptance of western medicine in emerging countries 
our customers are faced with increasing volumes of testing and a shrinking skilled labor pool while under constant pressure to contain costs 
consequently  it has become essential for manufacturers to provide cost effective systems to remain competitive 
a large number of the products in the discovery and automation systems product area are dependent on academic research funding and capital spending in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical and clinical research markets 
we are seeing an increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development investment along with a growing need to simplify and automate testing in the research markets 
these trends are driving growth in certain areas of this market where we are focused on becoming a provider of solutions for our various customers 
products such as the unicel dxi access immunoassay systems  the recently introduced unicel dxc and synchron clinical systems and the power processor front end automation system provide our customers with a means to increase efficiency through automation and workstation consolidation 
we believe these industry leading  high throughput platforms have positioned us to gain market share and increased streams of reagent revenues in the coming years 
to further the potential of these systems we are developing new assays internally  collaborating with external parties and pursuing business and technology acquisitions 
in hematology  we continue to automate more of the testing process with recently introduced platforms to serve both high volume hospital labs and small to mid sized labs 
our after market sales of chemistry kits  supplies and service have allowed us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we have used this cash flow to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products through internal development as well as business and technology acquisitions 
we have also used our operating cash flows to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay regular quarterly dividends 
we have recently shifted our emphasis to otls which requires additional investment in our instruments subject to lease and could reduce our cash flows in the next several years as we reach a new steady state level of otls 
we expect the majority of our lease arrangements to be otls in future years 
in order to continue to grow the company  gain market share and remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new instrument and reagent technologies and remain at the forefront in helping customers advance medical science  improve patients lives and reduce overall healthcare costs 
to remain competitive we must also acquire and defend intellectual property and invest in research and development 
otherwise  our current products could become technologically obsolete over time 
we believe that our cash flow will enable us to continue to fund these activities into the future 
we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could hamper our efforts to successfully increase market share and expand into new markets such as general worldwide economic weakness  pressure on healthcare spending  constrained government research funding and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for new products 
we believe we are addressing these risks by providing our customers automated and cost effective solutions 
a large number of our products require marketing authorizations from the us food drug administration fda and similar agencies in other countries 
we believe that we have effective quality and compliance programs in place and have been successful in obtaining the necessary clearances for our new products from the fda and other similar agencies 
acquisitions on may  the company acquired all of the stock of agencourt bioscience corporation agencourt of beverly  massachusetts  a leading provider of genomic services and nucleic acid purification products in the biomedical research market  for million  net of cash acquired 
the terms of the agreement provide for additional contingent payments  based on operating results and product development activities  of up to million through agencourt s patented solid phase reversible immobilization spri technology provides state of the art results for the isolation and purification of rna and dna 
we plan to use spri in automated sample preparation systems for biomedical research and molecular testing 
in addition to this technology  the acquisition brings talented scientists and a services business that will give the company a real time window into evolving customer needs 
on october   the company acquired all of the stock of diagnostic systems laboratories corporation dsl of webster  texas  for million  net of cash acquired 
dsl is a leading provider of specialty immunoassays including proprietary technology for reproductive endocrinology and cardiovascular risk assessment 
we plan to use the acquired technologies to enhance our current immunoassay product offerings in reproductive endocrinology and cardiovascular diagnostics 
we also plan to commercialize several of dsl s manual tests on our automated platforms beginning in reorganization on july   the company announced a reorganization whereby it will integrate the clinical diagnostics and biomedical research divisions into a single company structure that will create synergies and improve focus as we address the entire biomedical testing continuum 
under the new structure the company established four business centers focused on driving core product strategies 
these business centers are chemistry systems  cellular systems  immunoassay systems  and discovery and automation systems 
in connection with the reorganization we have combined our two previous reportable segments  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research  into a single company structure resulting in one reportable segment 
see note restructuring activities and asset impairments  of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the objective of the reorganization is to better enable us to leverage personnel  technologies and products across the entire biomedical testing continuum 
in connection with our reorganization plans  we decided to exit certain non strategic products and products currently under development 
significant projects that we have decided to exit include two lower priority investments in the cellular product area  an immunoassay for the detection and management of sepsis  and certain non core product lines in discovery and automation 
additionally  we have decided to exit certain non strategic products lines in the cellular and the discovery and automation product areas 
also  for the assets related to the above projects and product lines  as well as other less significant products  we recorded a million charge million after tax to write off patents  licenses and other related assets 
a charge of million million after tax was also recorded in cost of goods sold for inventory write offs related to the products that we are no longer offering 
we expect to eliminate approximately positions worldwide as a result of the reorganization 
accordingly  we recorded a charge for approximately million after tax for severance and related benefits for affected employees and other exit and contract termination costs 
additional charges of about million may also be incurred in as other plans related to the reorganization are implemented 
results of operations compared to revenues the following provides key product and geographical revenue information for and dollar amounts in millions revenues revenues reported growth constant currency growth chemistry systems cellular systems immunoassay systems discovery and automation systems united states international constant currency growth is not a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap defined measure of revenue growth 
constant currency growth as presented herein represents current period constant currency revenues see below less prior year reported revenues prior year reported revenues we define constant currency revenues as current period revenues in local currency translated to us dollars at the prior year s average foreign currency exchange rate 
this measure provides information on revenue growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior year and the current period 
constant currency revenues and constant currency growth as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  constant currency revenues is not an alternative measure of revenues on a us gaap basis 
as discussed above in the overview  we are undergoing a shift from stls to otls 
this increasing number of otls began negatively impacting revenues in under otls the recognition of instrument revenues and earnings are spread over the life of the lease arrangement  which is typically five years 
by contrast  under stls the recognition of instrument revenues and earnings is at the inception of the lease 
this shift impacted instrument related revenues within most product areas 
over the longer term  we expect this change to improve competitiveness and operating efficiency 
while this change negatively impacted instrument revenues across many of our product lines  we continued to experience robust placements of our instruments which in turn drives growth in aftermarket consumables sales 
consumables sales across all product lines grew in as a result of this large and growing installed base of systems and a greater average utilization of reagents 
a discussion of revenues by major product area for the year ended december  follows chemistry systems revenues were down in due primarily to the mid year change in emphasis to otl customer contracts as this product area is one of the most affected by the leasing policy change 
placements of our new unicel dxc and synchron systems are outperforming our expectations and are contributing to increased year over year system placements in chemistry systems 
as a result of the unit placements we are also generating significantly more consumables revenue in this product area 
partially offsetting our growth in chemistry consumables was the impact of raw material supply problems with certain reagents 
we are taking steps to address and resolve these issues and we do not expect these supply problems to have a significant impact on our operating results in future periods 
cellular systems revenues in cellular systems were up in placements of the coulter lh mid range and coulter lh high throughput hematology systems  fc and xl cytometers contributed to growth in this area and were partially offset by declines due to leasing policy changes 
immunoassay systems revenues in immunoassay systems were up in this product area was also significantly impacted by the leasing policy change in the third quarter 
however  this impact was offset in part by continued solid placements of the unicel dxi access immunoassay system  and a related increase in reagent revenues  as we increased our market share with this advanced high throughput analyzer 
discovery and automation systems revenues in discovery and automation systems were down in primarily as a result of the leasing policy shift 
prior year placements of lab automation products were particularly strong  due to the timing of several large orders 
automation sales take a considerable amount of time and effort to consummate and are therefore subject to significant volatility 
lab automation continues to be a key emphasis for the company and our overall strategy as our customers continue to focus on efficiency and cost savings that can be provided by increased automation 
offsetting the impact of the leasing policy shift and volatility in automation was growth in placements of our high performance and ultra centrifuges 
revenues by major geography revenues in the u 
s 
were down in primarily as a result of the shift toward otls 
sales in chemistry systems  cellular systems and immunoassay systems were all negatively impacted by the leasing policy change while unit placements and reagent revenues were up across several product lines 
consumables sales in all product areas in the us were up for discovery automation revenues were down primarily as a result of the timing of several large orders received in as compared to international revenues were up reported and up in constant currency in international revenues were led by results in europe where we experienced growth in both immunoassay systems and discovery and automation in france and in our european dealer markets as our products continue to gain acceptance 
these results were offset by market weakness in germany 
revenues in asia were aided by continued strength in china and south east asia offset by a recent decline in demand in japan as this country contends with health care reimbursement reforms and constraints on spending in the life sciences research market 
service revenues service revenues  which are also included in the product area discussions above  increased in from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to our growing installed base of instruments 
operating expenses gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margin was and for and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin was due to the following higher costs in our service function as we invest more in personnel to support installation and training for our new instruments  which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 
percentage points  and higher non standard costs for such items as freight  new product support  unfavorable overhead absorption variances and the impact of inventory write offs as a result of our reorganization and re focusing  which unfavorably impacted gross margin by percentage points  partially offset by  currency which favorably impacted gross margin by 
percentage points  and favorable product mix arising from higher profit consumables sales  which favorably impacted gross margin by 
percentage points 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million or of revenues in from million or of revenues in the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily the result of increased spending related to our new product launches and increased accruals under certain employee performance based compensation plans as well as several unusual items including a a million charge recorded to reserve for impaired receivables and write off damaged leased equipment as a result of hurricane katrina  b a million charge in connection with the retirement of our former ceo as a result of supplemental pension plan elections and the acceleration of a restricted stock award in the second quarter of  and c a million charge for a potential business development transaction that the company decided not to pursue recorded in the second quarter of  partially offset by d a million reduction of an environmental reserve in the second quarter of as a result of a decrease in the estimated costs of remediation 
research and development r d expenses increased million to million in from million in r d as a percentage of revenues was and in and  respectively 
the increase in r d spending is due primarily to the timing of certain projects and increased investment in next generation systems and tests 
restructuring activities and asset impairments as a result of the reorganization activities  the company decided to exit certain non strategic products and products under development  as it was determined that it no longer had significant sales or cash flow expectations for the related products 
accordingly  in  the company recorded a million charge to write off patents  licenses and other related assets and liabilities 
employee severance and related charges of million were also taken for certain positions identified as part of the restructuring  see note restructuring activities and asset impairments of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
non operating income and expenses interest income includes income from stl receivables 
interest income increased million to million in from million in  due primarily to the retention of more stl receivables 
these receivables generate interest income over the life of the lease and are occasionally sold to a third party 
see note sales of assets of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to higher variable interest rates and increased borrowing under our credit facility as a result of the acquisitions of agencourt and dsl 
the increase was offset by capitalization of interest of million related to costs incurred for internal use computer software 
other non operating income and expense includes the following in millions foreign exchange and related derivative activity gain on sales of stl receivables gain on sale of the assets of lao other total the decrease in foreign currency related activity costs is due primarily to decreased hedging expense resulting from the impact of our currency hedges offsetting the strengthening us dollar 
the million gain in relates to the expiration and reversal of an accrual for certain contingencies recorded pursuant to the asset sale agreement for the sale of laboratory automation operations lao in compared to revenues as discussed above  during we underwent a broad reorganization and have combined our previous two reportable segments  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research  into a single company structure resulting in one reportable segment 
the following discussion is consistent with our past organizational structure in place in and the following provides key product and geographical revenue information for and dollar amounts in millions revenues revenues reported growth constant currency growth routine chemistry immunodiagnostics total chemistry hematology total clinical diagnostics robotic automation genetic analysis centrifuge analytical systems total specialty testing total biomedical research americas united states canada and latin america europe asia constant currency growth is not a us gaap defined measure of revenue growth 
constant currency growth as presented herein represents current period constant currency revenues see below less prior year reported revenues prior year reported revenues we define constant currency revenues as current period revenues in local currency translated to us dollars at the prior year s average foreign currency exchange rate 
this measure provides information on revenue growth assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior year and the current period 
constant currency revenues and constant currency growth as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
additionally  constant currency revenues is not an alternative measure of revenues on a us gaap basis 
the sales growth during was primarily due to increases in sales of clinical diagnostic systems and related reagents aided by our new product flows 
the strengthening of foreign currencies  primarily the euro and yen  versus the us dollar  also contributed to the company s reported growth rates  adding for the year 
growth in clinical diagnostics of in was driven by strength in routine chemistry and immunodiagnostics 
routine chemistry revenues grew primarily as a result of sales of the synchron lx i combined routine chemistry and immunoassay system and sales of laboratory automation systems as our customers continue to focus on efficiency and cost savings 
immunodiagnostics revenues grew for the year as a result of placements of the unicel dxi access immunoassay system 
this product has allowed the company to enter into the large hospital and reference lab markets 
reagent sales in immunodiagnostics have also contributed to the significant growth in this product line 
over the past two years  the company has introduced twelve new assays for use on its immunoassay systems  including tests for pancreatic and breast cancer 
hematology sales growth was for the year and resulted primarily from sales of the coulter lh mid range and coulter lh high throughput hematology systems as these products continue to enjoy market acceptance 
biomedical research revenues grew in as the biomedical research and biotechnology markets continued a modest recovery 
growth in biomedical research was primarily a result of strong sales of specialty testing and proteomic products 
specialty testing grew in  as a result of increased sales of the cytomics fc series of flow cytometers and related reagents 
also contributing to the growth in biomedical research sales were the allegra x series of bench top centrifuges and the proteomelab pf d and pa systems within the centrifuge analytical systems product area 
partially offsetting these increases for the year was the sale of the laboratory automation operations lao product line that took place in the second quarter of this product line generated million of revenues in that did not recur in revenues in europe  in constant currency  increased led by sales of immunodiagnostics and specialty testing product lines throughout the region 
revenues in germany continue to depress overall sales growth in europe as this country continues to restructure its healthcare reimbursement policies 
revenues in asia  in constant currency  increased as a result of increased sales in clinical chemistry and immunodiagnostics product lines 
revenues in japan  in constant currency  though down in the early part of  and for the full year  actually grew in the fourth quarter of china and south east asia sales growth was particularly strong as our products continue to be well received 
service revenues  which are also included in the product area discussions above  increased in from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to our growing installed base of instruments 
operating expenses gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin was and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin was due to the following higher service costs to support new product introductions  which unfavorably impacted gross margin by percentage points  increased operating costs  primarily freight  which unfavorably impacted gross margin by percentage points  partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates  which favorably impacted the gross margin by percentage points 
sg a expenses increased million to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the prior year 
the dollar increase in sg a spending was a result of increased sales volume  a weaker us dollar  the increased investments in selling and marketing activities related to our immunoassay and other new product offerings and sales related incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in certain other employee bonus plans relative to those of due to the company not meeting certain internal objectives 
these employee bonus plans which are recorded in cost of goods sold  sg a and research and development  depending on the function of the eligible employee  decreased to million in from million in r d expenses increased million to million in from million in r d as a percentage of revenues was and in and  respectively 
changes in r d as a percentage of revenues are due primarily to the timing of certain projects and the impact of a weaker us dollar on revenue 
also contributing to a decrease in r d as a percentage of revenues were decreased employee bonus plans relative to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies did not impact r d expense  as substantially all r d efforts are in the us  resulting in a decrease in r d as a percentage of sales 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded a restructure charge of million which represented the anticipated total cost associated with a reorganization to form the biomedical research division  a refocus of international operations and a workforce reduction of nearly positions worldwide 
certain related employee termination costs were paid through the third quarter of for the year ended december  approximately million of restructuring charges were reversed as it was determined that these amounts were not going to be utilized 
non operating income and expenses interest income includes income from stl receivables 
interest income increased million to million in from million in  due primarily to retention of more stl receivables during as compared to stl receivables  which generate interest income over the life of the lease  are occasionally sold to a third party 
interest expense declined million to million in from million in due primarily to the successful resolution of certain segments of the internal revenue service irs audit of the tax years ending in through  which resulted in the elimination of approximately million of related interest accruals during also contributing to reduced interest expense in were lower average debt balances 
other non operating income and expense includes the following in millions foreign exchange and related derivative activity investment write downs gain on sales of stl receivables gain on sale of the assets of lao other total the million investment write down in was the result of impairments on the value of investments in both marketable and non marketable equity securities that were determined to be other than temporary in nature 
the increase in foreign currency related activity costs is due primarily to increased hedging expense resulting from the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the assets of lao were sold in the second quarter of and resulted in a million gain 
the million gain in relates to the expiration and reversal of an accrual for certain contingencies recorded pursuant to the asset sale agreement 
income taxes income tax as a percentage of pretax income was  and for the years  and  respectively 
income tax as a percentage of pretax income in was impacted by several items including the following irs notices that clarified the tax treatment of the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of  geographic profit mix  which includes reorganization expenses  the final settlement  in the first quarter of  of the remaining segments of the irs audit of the company for tax years through  and the reduction reversal of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets 
income tax as a percentage of pretax income in was impacted by several items as follows the resolution of certain segments of the irs audit for the tax years ended through  and the repatriation of million of formerly indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings in under the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act 
see note income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory tax rate to the company s effective tax rate 
we expect the effective tax rate in to be greater than that of  approximately  with potential quarterly fluctuations 
our effective tax rate will be impacted by a number of factors including  but not limited to  enactments of new tax laws  new interpretations of existing tax laws  rulings by and settlements with taxing authorities  our utilization of tax credits and our geographic profit mix 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to convert those assets that are no longer required in meeting existing strategic and financing objectives into cash 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting our commitments 
our business model  in particular sales from after market kits  supplies and service  allows us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we anticipate our operating cash flows will continue to satisfy our working capital requirements without the need for substantial additional indebtedness 
additionally  we currently do not have plans to significantly reduce our long term debt levels in the next twelve months due to the long term maturities of our senior notes 
this allows us to invest in areas that will help meet our strategic objectives 
we anticipate that our operating cash flow in will be substantially less than in due to the discontinuance of third party lease financing and the payment of reorganization expenses accrued in during the next twelve months  we anticipate using our operating cash flows to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products 
we expect new product offerings to come from existing r d projects  business acquisitions and by gaining access to new technologies through license arrangements  to increase our capital expenditures for customer leased instruments as we continue to shift toward otls  to reduce our borrowings under our credit facility that was drawn on to fund the acquisitions of agencourt and dsl  to contribute approximately million to our us pension trust  to maintain and raise our quarterly dividend 
our dividend paid in the fourth quarter was cents per share 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on march  to stockholders of record on february   and to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in january  the board of directors approved a plan authorizing the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock through during  million shares were repurchased for million under this plan 
additionally  related to our restructuring program  we expect to generate approximately million from the sale of two parcels of land and incur about million in restructure related severance and other costs in cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million between and primarily due to decreases in contributions to the us pension plan  from a million contribution to the us pension trust in that did not recur in increased cash collections of accounts receivable  resulting in an improvement in the company s days sales outstanding  increased year over year cash collections of stl receivables as a result of the leasing policy shift  and increased cash flows from inventories as a result of working capital management initiatives 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million between and primarily due to decreases in contributions to the us pension plans  from million in to million in  an increase in income tax liabilities in due primarily to increased taxable income and the timing of payments in our non us subsidiaries  partially offset by an increase in current and long term receivables associated with revenue growth and the retention of more stl receivables  decreased inventory turns from times in to times in due to a larger increase in ending inventory balances relative to the increase in cost of sales from to the introduction of various new products and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates contributed to this increase in ending inventory balances  and a decrease in cash flows related to the impact of items in that did not recur in  such as the restructure  the coulter escrow account and flextronics litigation settlements  which provided a combined million net positive cash flow in our customers have historically entered into three forms of lease transactions associated with our instruments which have different impacts on operating cash flows  revenues and earnings as follows one form is an otl where the customer enters into a long term cancellable contract to rent the instrument where we recognize revenue  earnings and operating cash flows associated with the instrument over the life of the contract 
as previously discussed  this form of contract was the predominant form of customer contract entered into in the second half of and had a negative impact on reported revenues and earnings 
additionally  we expect the majority of our contracts in the future to be of this type  a second form utilized extensively in the first half of and in prior years is a stl where the customer enters into a long term contract to lease the instrument where we recognize instrument related revenue and earnings up front but receive operating cash flows over the life of the contract 
at our initiative  we occasionally monetize the accounts receivable related to these stl arrangements 
in and we received million and million  respectively  under this program in the us see note sale of assets of the consolidated financial statements for more information  and a third form of contract utilized in and in prior years is an agreement with a third party financing company who buys the instrument from us and in turn leases it to the end user 
using this form  we recognize instrument revenue  earnings and operating cash flows at the time of sale 
as our leasing policy change is fully implemented and we no longer engage in this third form of transaction going forward  revenue  earnings and operating cash flows could be reduced in the near term 
however  over the long term our aggregate revenue  earnings and operating cash flows under our customer contracts are expected to be unaffected 
the company estimates that operating cash flows could be significantly reduced in  relative to those of and when million and million  respectively  of cash flows were accelerated from future periods under this third form of transaction see note commitments and contingencies  of our consolidated financial statements for more information 
the company may mitigate some of this impact on operating cash flows by continuing to monetize a portion of the us accounts receivable related to stl arrangements  as described above in the description of the second form of lease transaction 
at december  the balance of stls in the us was million 
investing activities used cash of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to the acquisition of agencourt and dsl for a combined million and an increase in capital expenditures 
the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in fixed assets for customer leased equipment  an increase in infrastructure related to insourcing a portion of our us distribution network and continued implementation of our global erp system 
the increase of million in capital expenditures in was due primarily to increases in customer leased equipment and the continued implementation of our erp system 
expenditures for customer leased equipment comprise a substantial portion of the company s total capital expenditures and these expenditures are expected to continue to rise in the future 
of the million  million and million in capital expenditures approximately  and for  and  respectively  were for customer leased equipment 
as part of our reorganization  we expect to eliminate positions worldwide 
if we terminate of the us pension plan participants and they request the cash settlement option  we could trigger a plan settlement under sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
a plan settlement would require a non cash charge to earnings of approximately million 
management intends to monitor the number of employees terminated which could trigger a plan settlement 
we are in the process of implementing an erp system in order to achieve a single  globally integrated infrastructure 
this includes functionality for finance  human resources  supply chain  order management  finished goods inventory management and sales and service to replace or complement existing legacy systems and business processes 
since the inception of the program in through december   we have capitalized million of costs associated with this erp system  which includes million of capitalized internal labor costs 
based on our geographic rollout strategy  as of december   we have essentially implemented functionality for finance  human resources and certain purchasing systems for our global operations 
sales functionality has been implemented on a limited basis for our us and canadian operations 
systems for finished goods inventory and physical distribution have been implemented for europe  including the deployment of systems for sales  service and order management in most entities in europe 
we expect that the majority of the work required to complete this phase of the global implementation of the new systems will take place through if we are unable to implement and effectively manage the transition to these new systems  our future consolidated operating results could be adversely affected 
in january  the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility that will terminate in january this agreement amended the company s then existing million unsecured credit facility which was due to expire in july to now provide the company with a million revolving line of credit  which may be increased in million increments up to a maximum line of credit of million 
interest on advances is determined using formulas specified in the agreement  generally  an approximation of libor plus a to margin 
the company also must pay a facility fee of per annum on the aggregate average daily amount of each lender s commitment 
at december  there was million drawn on the million credit facility 
the company drew on the credit facility during in order to fund the acquisitions of both agencourt and dsl 
at december  approximately million of unused  uncommitted  short term lines of credit were available to the company s subsidiaries outside the us at various interest rates 
within the us  million in unused  uncommitted  short term lines of credit at prevailing market rates were available 
based upon current levels of operations and expected future growth  we believe our cash flows from operations together with available borrowings under our credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for interest payments and other debt service obligations  working capital  capital expenditures  lease payments  pension contributions  future business acquisitions and other operating needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance existing indebtedness  will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the following is included in long term debt at december  and dollar amounts in millions average rate of interest senior notes  unsecured  due senior notes  unsecured  due debentures  unsecured  due credit facility other long term debt in october  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission 
this registration  which became effective in early gives us the ability to offer and sell up to million of securities  which may include debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and warrants to purchase debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or depository shares 
the issuance of any such securities could represent new financing or could be used to pay down existing debt 
we have no immediate plans to offer or sell any securities 
the following represents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments in millions payments due by period total thereafter long term debt and interest a b operating leases other c total contractual cash obligations a the amounts for long term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates 
the amounts include interest  but exclude the unamortized discount of million  and the million fair value adjustment recorded for the reverse interest rate swap as permitted by sfas no 
see note debt financing of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
b the million debentures due include a feature that could require repayment in see note debt financing of the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the million has been included within the long term debt payments due in c other consists primarily of inventory purchase commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding in their calls on judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we are not aware of any reasonably possible events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including customer leased instruments for products  revenue is recognized when risk of loss transfers  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when a customer enters into an otl agreement  hardware revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  while the cost of the leased equipment is carried in customer leased equipment within property  plant and equipment and amortized over its estimated useful life 
under a stl agreement  hardware revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment based on the present value of the minimum lease payments with interest income recognized over the life of the lease using the interest method 
instrument costs under a stl agreement are recognized at the time of shipment 
service revenues on maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the service agreement or as service is performed  if not under contract 
for those instrument sales that include multiple deliverables  such as installation  training  after market supplies or service  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
credit is extended based upon the evaluation of the customer s financial condition and we generally do not require collateral 
determination of appropriate revenue recognition for leases our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas  which often involve complex provisions and significant judgments 
the four criteria of sfas that we use in the determination of a stl or otl are a review of the lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than percent of the economic life of the equipment  a review of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than percent of the fair market value of the equipment  a determination of whether or not the lease transfers ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term  and determination of whether or not the lease contains a bargain purchase option 
additionally  before classifying a lease as an stl  we assess whether collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured and whether there are any significant uncertainties related to costs that we have yet to incur with respect to the lease 
generally  our leases that qualify as stls are non cancelable leases with a term of percent or more of the economic life of the equipment 
certain of our lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria 
the economic life of our leased instrument and its fair value require significant accounting estimates and judgment 
these estimates are based on our historical experience 
the most objective measure of the economic life of our leased instrument is the original term of a lease  which is typically five years  since a majority of the instruments are returned by the lessee at or near the end of the lease term and there is not a significant after market for our used instruments without substantial remanufacturing 
we believe that this is representative of the period during which the instrument is expected to be economically usable  with normal service  for the purpose for which it is intended 
we regularly evaluate the economic life of existing and new products for purposes of this determination 
the fair market value of our leased instruments is determined by a range of cash selling prices or other verifiable objective evidence  if applicable 
we regularly evaluate available objective evidence of instrument fair values using historical data 
we have certain government contracts with cancellation clauses or renewal provisions that are generally required by law  such as those dependant on fiscal funding outside of a governmental unit s control  those that can be cancelled if deemed in the tax payers best interest or those that must be renewed each fiscal year  given limitations that may exist on multi year contracts that are imposed by statute 
under these circumstances and in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  as well as considering our historical experience  a thorough evaluation of these contracts is performed to assess whether cancellation is remote or whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured 
reserves for doubtful accounts we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these reserves are determined by analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and applying historical loss rates to the aging of the remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory cost 
inventory schedules are regularly analyzed by finance and logistics personnel  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
a significant increase in the forecasted demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in forecasted demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory write downs 
goodwill and other intangible assets we allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired  including tangible assets  intangible assets with definite lives and intangible assets with indefinite lives  based upon the estimated fair values of the related assets 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on the expected number of years the asset will generate revenue 
this estimate of useful lives is reviewed periodically by management 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and assessing the ongoing appropriateness of the indefinite life classification 
for goodwill  a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment test on goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
at december   we had million of goodwill 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units we use a comparable industry revenue multiple approach 
under this approach  we determine the average number of years of sales for certain companies in the appropriate industry that are required to equal that company s enterprise value  comparable industry revenue multiple 
we then take the product of the revenues for our reporting units and the comparable industry revenue multiple  which represented that reporting unit s fair value and compared this to the reporting unit s book value  which resulted in no goodwill impairment 
accordingly  step two of the goodwill impairment test was not required to be performed 
we perform our annual impairment test on other intangible assets that have indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
at december   the million net book value of our coulter trade name and core technology was less than its estimated value as determined by an external valuation specialist using a relief from royalty income approach 
accordingly  these assets are not impaired 
numerous assumptions are developed in conjunction with our testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives such as the determination of appropriate revenue multiples and royalty rates  the selection of appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of future cash flows and long term revenue projections 
an increase or decrease in any of these assumptions or a change in plans related to the utilization of the coulter trade name and the core technology or a significant downturn in our business may result in a material impairment charge required to write down the book value of these assets 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
environmental obligations we establish provisions for exposure related to environmental and legal matters 
our compliance with federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations may require us to remove or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances in jurisdictions where we do business or maintain properties 
we establish reserves when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
provision amounts are estimated based on currently available information  regulatory requirements  remediation strategies  our relative share of the total remediation costs and a relevant discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could impact our future reported results 
legal obligations we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which we consider to be normal for our type of business operations 
as a global company active in a wide range of life sciences and chemical activities  we may  in the normal course of our business become involved in proceedings relating to matters such as patent validity and infringement disputes related to intellectual property  contractual obligations  and employment and other matters 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any proceedings in which we are or may become involved 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking damages from us could result in a monetary award to the plaintiff and  to the extent not covered by our insurance policies or third party indemnities  could significantly harm the results of our operations 
an adverse decision in a lawsuit seeking an injunction or other similar relief could significantly harm our business operations 
if we lose a case in which we seek to enforce our patent rights  we could sustain a loss of future revenue as other manufacturers begin to market products we developed 
litigation cases and claims raise difficult and complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities  including  but not limited to  the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim  the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought  and differences in applicable law 
upon resolution of any pending legal matters  we may incur charges in excess of presently established provisions and related insurance or third party coverage 
it is possible that our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation 
although  we believe that our provisions are appropriate  and in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
changes in events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  profitability or liquidity 
income taxes we record liabilities for probable income tax assessments based on our estimate of potential tax related exposures 
recording of these assessments requires significant judgment as uncertainties often exist in respect to new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
an increase or decrease to income would occur if the company were to determine that it was able to utilize more or less of these deferred tax assets than currently expected 
pension plans our funding policy provides that payments to our domestic pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption as to the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
our review of this long term return assumption is done in conjunction with our pension plan investment advisors and our actuaries 
we also review historical cumulative returns on plan assets 
the rate of return is dependent upon an investment strategy and the asset allocation of plan assets 
we then review the selected prospective return rate against benchmark information that we gather on other pension plans adjusting for relative size  investment strategies and funding levels 
since this is a long term return assumption  it is likely to change only when there are protracted changes in equity  bond and real estate markets 
while there is no absolute predictor of future performance  our historical return on plan assets has been over and we believe this historical performance is a fair approximation of what our plan assets can achieve over a variety of market conditions 
see note retirement benefits of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we believe our rate of return assumption is reasonable based on our long term investment strategy and allocation of our plan assets  which at december  had an allocation as follows equities  corporate bonds  real estate and other 
the discount rate is an assumption used to determine the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to the services rendered by participants in our pension plans 
the rate used reflects our best estimate of the rate at which pension benefits will be effectively settled 
we estimate this rate based on available rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available  primarily moody s aa corporate bond yields with terms similar to the expected timing of payments to be made under our pension obligations 
changes in the rate of return or discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligation and related pension expense 
the following table outlines the approximate impact that a increase or decrease in the rate of return or discount rate would have on our us pension expense and projected benefit obligation in millions pension cost projected benefit obligation increase decrease in expected rate of return n a increase decrease in discount rate we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the u 
s 
securities and exchange commission requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in currency exchange and interest rates in their form k filings 
several alternatives  all with some limitations  have been offered 
the following discussion is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this analysis is constrained by several factors  including the following it is based on a single point in time  and it does not include the effects of other complex market reactions that would arise from the changes modeled 
although the results of the analysis may be useful as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and canadian dollar 
as of december  and  the notional amounts of all derivative foreign exchange contracts was million and million  respectively 
notional amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates 
the net fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts as of december  and  was a net asset liability of million and million  respectively 
we estimated the sensitivity of the fair value of all derivative foreign exchange contracts to a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the spot exchange rates for the us dollar against the foreign currencies at december  the analysis showed that a strengthening of the us dollar would result in a gain from a fair value change of million and a weakening of the us dollar would result in a loss from a fair value change of million in these instruments 
losses and gains on the underlying transactions being hedged would largely offset any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
similarly  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our variable rate debt instruments and derivatives 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates was estimated to decrease or increase the company s pre tax earnings by million based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december  this analysis includes the effect of our reverse interest rate swap derivatives which change the character of the interest rate on our long term debt by effectively converting a fixed rate to a variable rate 
additional information with respect to our foreign currency and interest rate exposures are discussed in note derivatives of the consolidated financial statements 
financial risk management our risk management program  developed by senior management and approved by the board of directors  seeks to minimize the potentially negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on the results of operations 
our primary exposures to fluctuations in the financial markets are to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange risk arises because our reporting currency is the us dollar and we generate approximately of our revenues in various foreign currencies 
us dollar denominated costs and expenses as a percentage of total operating costs and expenses are much greater than us dollar denominated sales as a percentage of total net sales 
as a result  appreciation of the us dollar against our major trading currencies has a negative impact on our results of operations  and depreciation of the us dollar against such currencies has a positive impact 
we seek to minimize our exposure to changes in exchange rates by denominating costs and expenses in foreign currencies 
when these opportunities are exhausted  we use derivative financial instruments to function as hedges 
we use forward contracts and purchased option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated transactions 
we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises out of our long term debt obligations 
under the guidance of our risk management policies  we use derivative contracts on certain borrowing transactions 
with the aid of these contracts  we seek to reduce the negative effects of changes in interest rates by changing the character of the interest rate on our long term debt  converting a fixed rate to a variable rate and vice versa 
inflation we continually monitor inflation and the effects of changing prices 
inflation increases the cost of goods and services used 
competitive and regulatory conditions in many markets restrict our ability to fully recover the higher costs of acquired goods and services through price increases 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of inflation by implementing continuous process improvement solutions to enhance productivity and efficiency and  as a result  lower costs and operating expenses 
the effects of inflation have  in our opinion  been managed appropriately and as a result have not had a material impact on our operations and the resulting financial position or liquidity
