item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended march    and  should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  opinions  expectations  anticipations and intentions and beliefs 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and business sections elsewhere in this report on form k 
in the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  certain financial measures may be considered non gaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules 
these rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation  which is provided in this annual report on form k 
enersys management uses non gaap measures in their analysis of the company s performance 
these measures  as used by enersys  adjust net earnings determined in accordance with gaap to reflect changes in financial results associated with our ipo  and the elimination of highlighted charges recorded during the periods presented 
management believes presentations of financial measures reflecting these adjustments provide useful supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of our business 
these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for net earnings determined in accordance with gaap  nor are they necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies 
overview we are the world s largest manufacturer  marketer and distributor of industrial batteries 
we also manufacture  market and distribute related products such as chargers  power equipment and battery accessories  and we provide related after market and customer support services for industrial batteries 
we market and sell our products globally in more than countries to over  customers through a network of distributors  independent representatives and an internal sales force 
a 
table of contents we have two business segments reserve power and motive power 
revenue and expense classifications by segment are as follows reserve power batteries are used to provide backup power for the continuous operation of critical telecommunications and ups during power disruptions  and for other specialty applications including aerospace and defense 
motive power batteries are used to power mobile manufacturing  warehousing and other ground handling equipment  primarily electric industrial forklift trucks 
we evaluate business segment performance based primarily upon operating earnings  exclusive of highlighted charges 
all corporate and centrally incurred regional costs are allocated to the business segments based principally on net sales 
we evaluate business segment cash flow and financial position performance based primarily upon capital expenditures and primary working capital levels 
primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable  plus inventories  minus trade accounts payable and the resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales annualized for the respective business segment or reporting location  to derive a primary working capital percentage ratio 
although we monitor the three elements of primary working capital receivables  inventory and payables  our primary focus is on the total amount 
primary working capital was million yielding a primary working capital percentage ratio of at march   and million yielding a primary working capital percentage ratio of at march  the percentage point decrease in the ratio during fiscal was primarily due to a lower level of inventory and a higher level of accounts payable  relative to sales 
we closely manage our level of working capital due to the significant impact it has on cash flow and  as a result  our level of debt 
lastly  on a consolidated basis  we review short and long term debt levels  on a daily basis  with corresponding leverage ratios monitored  primarily using debt to ebitda ratios  excluding highlighted charges 
ebitda is earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
highlighted charges are expenses not normally incurred in the day to day operations of our business and  in our opinion  are not indicative of our core operating performance 
examples include charges incurred in fiscal associated with the costs of uncompleted acquisition attempts  an omnibus settlement with invensys and costs in connection with a recapitalization transaction  charges incurred in fiscal associated with the write off of unamortized deferred finance costs and a prepayment penalty on the repayment of our senior secured lien term loan in connection with our ipo  and charges incurred in fiscal for restructuring associated with cost reduction programs 
see credit facilities and leverage for a discussion of the use of ebitda non gaap 
we operate and manage our business in three primary geographic regions of the world the americas  europe and asia 
our business is highly decentralized with manufacturing locations throughout the world 
over half of our net sales for fiscal  and were generated outside of north america 
more than half of our manufacturing capacity is located outside of the us our management structure and financial reporting systems  and associated internal controls and procedures  are all consistent with our two business segments and three geographic regions in which we operate 
we report on a march fiscal year 
our financial results are largely driven by the following factors general cyclical patterns of the industries in which our customers operate  changes in our market share in the business segments and regions where we operate  changes in our selling prices and  in periods when our product costs increase  our ability to raise our selling prices to pass such cost increases through to our customers  the extent to which we are able to efficiently utilize our global manufacturing facilities and optimize their capacity  the extent to which we can control our fixed and variable costs  including those for our raw materials  manufacturing and distribution  operating activities and interest  and changes in our short and long term debt levels and changes in the floating interest rates under our credit facilities 
a 
table of contents due to competitive pressures  we have been subjected to continual and significant pricing pressures over the past several years 
we anticipate heightened competitive pricing pressure as chinese and other foreign producers  able to employ labor at significantly lower costs than producers in the us and western europe  expand their export capacity and increase their marketing presence in our major us and european markets 
our ability to maintain and improve our operating margins has depended  and continues to depend  on our ability to control our costs and maintain our pricing 
particularly over the past two fiscal years and  we have experienced significant increases in many of our commodity costs 
the lme price for lead alone  which approximates of our total cost of goods sold  has increased approximately since the beginning of fiscal year we estimate that selling price increases have resulted in the recovery of approximately  on a cumulative basis since the beginning of fiscal  of the higher costs of our commodities 
our selling price increases approximate of net sales for both fiscal and fiscal our business strategy in this environment of high commodity costs is to improve profitability by cost savings and pricing actions  as well as to tightly control operating cash flow and capital spending 
our corporate history there have been several key stages in the development of our business  which explain to a significant degree our results of operations over the past three years 
we were formed in late by morgan stanley capital partners currently metalmark capital  and the management of yuasa  inc to acquire the industrial battery business of yuasa corporation japan in north and south america 
our results of operations for the past five fiscal years have been significantly affected by our acquisition of esg on march  and to a lesser extent  by fiamm on june  the esg acquisition more than doubled our size 
our results of operations for fiscal and thereafter  include esg for the full fiscal years 
our results of operations for fiscal include fiamm from its june  acquisition date 
our successful integration of esg provided global scale in both the reserve and motive power markets 
the esg acquisition also provided us with a further opportunity to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency that  among other initiatives  led to closing underutilized manufacturing plants  distribution facilities  sales offices and eliminating other redundant costs  including staff 
fiamm complements our existing european motive power business and also provided us with opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency 
in august  enersys completed an initial public offering the ipo and issued  shares of our common stock at a value of per share 
the company s common stock commenced trading on the new york stock exchange on july   under the trading symbol ens 
at the completion of the offering  we had  shares of common stock outstanding  which included  shares that were outstanding prior to the ipo   shares of common stock converted from preferred shares  and  new shares issued in the ipo 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
the net proceeds and million of other corporate funds were used to prepay the entire principal and accrued interest and prepayment penalty on our senior second lien term loan million and to prepay a portion million of our million senior secured term loan b 
in august  in order to take advantage of the company s lower leverage and lower market borrowing costs  we amended our senior secured credit agreement and reduced our borrowing rates on the senior secured term loan b by 
the existing term loans million plus accrued interest were paid off and simultaneously new term loans of million were borrowed 
our historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal and show our result of operations as a private company 
in fiscal and fiscal  the cost of complying with our new public company reporting obligations and other costs associated with a public company was approximately million and million  respectively 
the significant increase in fiscal costs was due primarily to our compliance with the requirements of sarbanes oxley section a 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expense 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
asset impairment determinations as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
the company tests for the impairment of its goodwill and trade names at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that a possible impairment has been incurred 
the company utilizes financial projections of its reporting segments  certain cash flow measures  as well as its market capitalization in its determination of the fair value of these assets 
with respect to our other long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we are required to test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset was impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in making future cash flow analyses of goodwill and other long lived assets  the company makes assumptions relating to the following the intended use of assets and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use  industry specific economic conditions  competitor activities and regulatory initiatives  and client and customer preferences and patterns 
we believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
litigation and claims the company is a party to various legal actions and investigations including  among others  employment matters  compliance with government regulations  federal and state employment laws  including wage and hour laws  contractual disputes and other matters  including matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims may be brought by  among others  the government  clients  customers and employees 
management considers the measurement of litigation reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the significant uncertainty in some cases relating to the outcome of potential claims or litigation and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from litigation or other claims 
in determining legal reserves  management considers  among other issues interpretation of contractual rights and obligations  the status of government regulatory initiatives  interpretations and investigations  a 
table of contents the status of settlement negotiations  prior experience with similar types of claims  whether there is available insurance  and advice of counsel 
environmental loss contingencies accruals for environmental loss contingencies ie  environmental reserves are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can reasonably be estimated 
management views the measurement of environmental reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the considerable uncertainty surrounding estimation  including the need to forecast well into the future 
we are involved in legal proceedings under state  federal and local environmental laws in connection with our operations and companies that we have acquired 
the estimation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information  prior experience in the remediation of contaminated sites and assumptions with respect to government regulations and enforcement activity  changes in remediation technology and practices  and financial obligations and credit worthiness of other responsible parties and insurers 
warranty we record a warranty reserve for possible claims against our product warranties  which generally run for a period of one to twenty years for our reserve power batteries and for a period of one year to seven years for our motive power batteries 
the assessment of the adequacy of the reserve includes a review of open claims and historical experience 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the warranty reserve is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the reserve can change from time to time and warranty claims could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
we record a provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  management analyzes the creditworthiness of specific customers and the aging of customer balances 
management also considers general and specific industry economic conditions  industry concentration and contractual rights and obligations 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from time to time and uncollectible accounts could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations 
inventory obsolescence we record an inventory obsolescence reserve for obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
in calculating our inventory obsolescence reserve  management analyzes historical data regarding customer demand within specific product categories and makes assumptions regarding economic conditions within customer specific industries  as well as style and product changes 
management believes that its accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because customer demand in certain of our businesses can be variable and changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence could have a material affect on our results of operations 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions related to our inventory obsolescence reserve are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
a 
table of contents pension plans we use certain assumptions in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit plans 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rates of return of assets 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by us  additional expense may be required 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions related to the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit plans are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases on recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the reliability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
derivative financial instruments the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and option agreements to manage risk on a portion of its long term floating rate debt 
the company has entered into lead forward purchase contracts to manage risk of the cost of lead 
the company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage risk on foreign currency exposures 
the agreements are with major financial institutions  and the company believes the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties is negligible 
the counterparties to certain of these agreements are lenders under the credit agreement and liabilities related to these agreements are covered under the security provisions of the credit agreement 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of those instruments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss if they qualify for hedge accounting or in earnings if they do not qualify for hedge accounting 
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting if they are designated as hedge instruments and if the hedge is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of cash flow of the asset or liability hedged 
effectiveness is measured on a regular basis by comparing the overall changes in the expected cash flows on the lead and foreign currency forward contracts with the changes in the expected all in cash outflow required for the lead and foreign currency purchases 
this analysis is performed on the initial purchases each month that cover the quantities hedged 
accordingly  gains and losses from changes in derivative fair value are deferred until the underlying transaction occurs 
interest expense on the debt is adjusted to include the payments made or received under such interest rate swap agreements 
inventory and cost of goods sold is adjusted to include the payments made or received under such lead and foreign currency forward contracts 
any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments  which on infrequent occasions may be terminated prior to maturity are recognized in earnings in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized 
in the event a designated hedged item is sold  extinguished or matures prior to the termination of the related derivative instrument  such instrument would be closed and the resulting gain or loss would be recognized in earnings 
a 
table of contents market and economic conditions our operating results are directly affected by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which our major customer groups operate 
both our reserve power and motive power segments are heavily dependent on the end markets they serve  and our results of operations will vary depending on the capital expenditure environment in these markets 
in addition  general economic conditions in the us and international markets in which we and our customers operate also affect demand for our products 
sales of our motive power products  for example  depend significantly on demand for new electric industrial forklift trucks  which in turn depends on end user demand for additional motive capacity in their distribution and manufacturing facilities 
the overall economic conditions in the markets we serve can be expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
in fiscal  market and economic conditions generally were stable and began improving  particularly in the second half of the fiscal year in the americas and asia 
in fiscal  excluding highlighted charges  earnings and operating cash flow increased as sales excluding the effect of foreign currency translation increased approximately  the euro strengthened on average for the year by against the dollar and cost reduction programs yielded additional savings 
in fiscal  economic growth and the market for industrial batteries were up significantly in the americas  very strong in asia  and showed modest growth in europe 
in fiscal market and economic conditions remained strong in all regions  however we experienced significant cost pressure on our raw material costs  primarily lead 
see quarterly information 
over the last three fiscal years  the costs of our raw materials of which lead is our primary material have risen significantly 
we estimate that our average pure lead based cost excluding premiums per pound  as it affects our operating results  has risen from in fiscal to in fiscal and to in fiscal since the cost of purchased lead is not reflected in our cost of goods sold for two to three months after purchase  we compare our actual cost to london metal exchange lme prices that are in effect two to three months prior to the income statement period being shown 
on this basis  average lme prices per period were  and in fiscal  and  respectively  as they would have been reflected in our operating results 
our estimated incremental lead cost due to increased price in fiscal over fiscal was approximately million  the incremental cost in fiscal was approximately million over fiscal we have implemented a series of selling price increases to offset some of the impact of these rising commodity costs 
we believe we recovered approximately of the cumulative increase in commodity costs since the beginning of fiscal these selling price increases approximate of net sales for both fiscal and respectively 
we will continue to aggressively pursue price increases in fiscal  but cannot assure you that our customers will accept future price increases 
cost savings programs are and have been a continuous element of our business strategy and are directed primarily at further reductions in plant manufacturing labor and overhead and raw materials costs 
numerous individual cost savings opportunities are identified and evaluated by management with a formal selection and approval process that results in an ongoing list of cost savings projects to be implemented 
in certain cases  projects are either modified or abandoned during their respective implementation phases 
in order to realize cost savings benefits for a majority of these initiatives  costs are incurred either in the form of capital expenditures  funding the cash obligations of previously recorded restructuring expenses or current period expenses 
components of revenue and expense net sales include the invoiced amount for all products sold and services provided  freight costs  when paid for by our customers  less all related allowances  rebates  discounts and sales  value added or similar taxes 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of material  labor and overhead  the cost of our service businesses  freight  warranty and other costs such as distribution centers  obsolete or slow moving inventory provisions  and certain types of insurance 
for fiscal and  we estimate that materials costs comprised approximately one half of cost of goods sold 
the largest single raw material cost is lead  which comprised approximately of cost of goods sold in fiscal a 
table of contents we employ significant amounts of lead  plastics  steel  copper and other materials in our manufacturing processes 
the costs of these raw materials  particularly lead  are volatile and beyond our control 
incremental lead costs were approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a result of price increases experienced during that year 
lead is our single largest raw material item and the price of lead recently has experienced significant volatility 
the highest price for lead during fiscal was per pound on december  the highest price for lead during fiscal was per pound on february   and the highest price for lead since the end of fiscal was per pound on may  lead  plastics  steel and copper in the aggregate represent our principal raw materials costs 
volatile raw materials costs can significantly affect our operating results and make period to period comparisons difficult 
the costs of commodity raw materials such as lead  steel and copper have increased significantly in recent periods 
we attempt to control our raw materials costs through strategic purchasing decisions 
where possible  we pass along some or all of our increased raw materials costs to our customers 
the following table shows certain average commodity prices for fiscal  and  which have not been adjusted for the timing of the impact on our financial results lead lb 
steel lb 
copper lb 
source london metal exchange lme source nucor corporation labor and overhead are primarily attributable to our manufacturing facilities 
overhead includes plant operating costs such as utilities  repairs and maintenance  taxes  supplies and depreciation 
operating expenses include all non manufacturing selling  general and administrative  engineering and other expenses 
these include salaries and wages  sales commissions  fringe benefits  professional fees  supplies  maintenance  general business taxes  rent  communications  travel and entertainment  depreciation  advertising and bad debt expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal were incurred in the following functional areas of our business as a percent of the total and are substantially similar in both of our business segments 
selling general and administrative engineering total restructuring and other charges in comparing fiscal financial results to fiscal  management believes it is appropriate to highlight the million of operating restructuring and other charges incurred in fiscal and the million of non operating ipo related charges that occurred in fiscal other income expense  net includes non operating foreign currency transaction gains losses  license fees and rental income 
due to our global manufacturing and distribution footprint  which means that most of our operating costs and revenues are incurred and paid in local currencies  we believe that we have a significant natural hedge against the impact on our business of exchange rate fluctuations

we estimate that our price increases realized in fiscal approximate of net sales 
we estimate that the impact of higher lead costs alone  our primary raw material  unfavorably affected our operating earnings by approximately million in fiscal in comparing fiscal financial results to fiscal  management believes it is appropriate to highlight the million of operating restructuring and other charges incurred in fiscal and the million of non operating ipo related charges that occurred in fiscal net sales by geographic region were as follows fiscal fiscal increase decrease in millions total sales in millions total sales in millions europe americas asia total all geographic regions experienced solid sales growth in fiscal the euro  which had strengthened throughout fiscal  weakened by in  having an impact on our europe business 
we believe the americas business continued to gain market share with particularly strong growth in the motive power segment 
asia s revenue growth is primarily attributed to continued general business expansion in that region 
further  europe revenue benefited from the fiamm and gaz acquisitions  which increased their net sales by approximately a 
table of contents million in fiscal after excluding the impact of the fiamm and gaz acquisitions and adjusting for the impact of the weaker currencies primarily the euro in fiscal  consolidated net sales increased approximately compared to the prior year 
operating earnings by geographic region were as follows fiscal fiscal increase decrease in millions as net sales in millions as net sales in millions europe americas asia other n a n a subtotal restructuring and other charges total adjusting for the unfavorable impact of weaker currencies primarily the euro  europe s operating earnings increased approximately in fiscal  which is less than the net sales growth of approximately 
this slower growth in operating earnings was primarily attributable to higher commodity and public company costs  partially offset by sales price increases and cost savings programs 
americas operating earnings increased moderately as net sales grew by approximately 
the americas operating earnings were also adversely affected by higher commodity and public company costs  which were partially offset by sales price increases and cost savings programs 
asia s operating earnings were negatively affected by higher commodity costs in fiscal with virtually no increase in sales prices realized as competitive conditions remain particularly challenging in this region 
a discussion of specific fiscal versus fiscal operating results follows  including an analysis and discussion of the results of our two business segments 
net sales fiscal fiscal increase in millions total sales in millions total sales in millions reserve power motive power total net sales increased million or in fiscal over fiscal weaker european currencies  primarily the euro compared to the us dollar  resulted in a decrease of million in fiscal net sales or

a 
table of contents strong efforts to pass through higher commodity costs via sales price increases were made in all regions 
as described previously  competitive conditions remain challenging in our industry  with only a partial recovery of higher commodity costs experienced in fiscal from sales price increases 
we estimate realized selling price increases of approximately in fiscal  which represents roughly one half of the commodity cost increases experienced during this year 
we remain highly focused on maximizing our pricing actions with the full impact from our two most recent announced price increases november of and january   expected to be realized during the first half of fiscal the time lag in realizing announced price increases in our operating results is caused primarily by the impact of our order backlog 
we expect to realize significantly greater price recovery in fiscal than was experienced in fiscal in general  more selling price realization has occurred in our motive power business in comparison to our reserve power business during fiscal fiscal net sales growth  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  in reserve power and motive power was approximately and  respectively  compared to fiscal in the reserve power segment excluding the effect of foreign currency translation when comparing fiscal sales to fiscal sales  our reserve power segment achieved solid growth in fiscal primarily due to improving sales trends for both telecom and ups battery markets and the strong sales of aerospace and defense batteries  coupled with the impact of approximately million of increased sales from the october gaz acquisition 
the strong growth experienced in our motive power segment in the prior year continued into fiscal additionally  the segment included the impact of approximately million in sales from the june  fiamm acquisition and the continued expansion of our asia motive power business

incremental commodity costs in fiscal compared to the pricing of commodities in the comparable periods of fiscal were approximately million 
lead represents our principal raw material and approximates of total cost of goods sold for fiscal lead costs continue to increase dramatically and  on an lme basis as it affects our income statement  approximated lb in fiscal compared to approximately lb in the prior year 
we continue to focus on cost savings initiatives to help mitigate the rising cost of commodities

table of contents earnings before income taxes fiscal earnings before income taxes were million  a decrease of million compared to fiscal excluding the million of highlighted restructuring and other charges in fiscal and the million in highlighted ipo related charges in fiscal  fiscal earnings before income taxes declined million  primarily because of higher commodity and public company costs 
income tax expense the fiscal effective income tax rate was compared to in fiscal this rate reduction is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings among our various legal entities in multiple foreign jurisdictions  which resulted in a higher proportion of our consolidated earnings being in tax jurisdictions with tax rates lower than our previous global averages  and a non recurring million tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of fiscal net earnings fiscal net earnings were million compared to fiscal earnings of million 
the million decrease is due primarily to a million increase in gross profit  offset by a million increase in operating expenses  million of fiscal highlighted charges compared to million in fiscal  a million increase in interest expense  and a million decrease in other income 
also partially offsetting the decrease was a million decrease in income tax expense which reflects the reduction of the pre tax earnings and the effective income tax rate

table of contents overview fiscal results included both a net sales increase and a net income increase despite the unfavorable effect of record high level of costs of commodities 
we estimate that the impact of higher lead costs alone  our primary raw material  unfavorably affected our operating earnings by approximately million 
we partially mitigated this dramatic rise in raw material costs through price increases being passed through to our customers which was approximately of net sales and by continuing cost savings programs throughout the company 
in comparing fiscal results to fiscal operating results  management believes it is appropriate to highlight charges incurred million of non operating highlighted charges in and million of operating highlighted charges and million of non operating highlighted charges in fiscal year 
net sales by geographic region were as follows fiscal fiscal increase decrease in millions total sales in millions total sales in millions europe americas asia total all geographic regions experienced sales growth in fiscal the euro  which strengthened by approximately in fiscal  had a significant favorable impact on our europe business 
we believe the americas business continued to gain market share with particularly strong growth in the motive power segment 
asia s revenue growth is attributed to modest market share gains and general business expansion in that region 
after adjusting for the impact of stronger currencies primarily the euro  consolidated net sales increased approximately compared to the prior year

this decrease was primarily attributable to higher commodity costs  partially offset by sales price increases and cost savings programs 
america s operating earnings increased moderately as net sales grew by approximately  with our motive power business continuing to gain additional market share 
the america s operating earnings were also adversely affected by higher commodity costs  which were partially offset by sales price increases and cost savings programs 
asia s operating earnings increased  as strong growth was experienced in net sales from our continued expansion of business in this region 
asia operating earnings were negatively impacted by higher commodity costs in fiscal with virtually no increase in sales prices realized as competitive conditions remain particularly challenging in this region

net sales fiscal fiscal increase in millions total sales in millions total sales in millions reserve power motive power total fiscal sales  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  increased  or million 
the remaining fiscal increase of million was attributable to the strong european currencies  primarily the euro compared to the us dollar 
the euro exchange rate to the us dollar averaged in fiscal compared to in fiscal strong efforts to pass through higher commodity costs via sales price increases were made in both the americas and europe 
as described previously  competitive conditions were challenging in our industry  with only a partial recovery of higher commodity costs experienced in fiscal from sales price increases 
we estimate that approximately of our fiscal increase in commodity costs was recovered 
we estimate realized selling price increases of approximately in fiscal in general  more selling price realization was experienced in our motive power business in comparison to our reserve power business 
further  competitive conditions in asia were particularly challenging with virtually no sales price increases realized in fiscal fiscal net sales growth  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  in reserve power and motive power was approximately and  respectively  compared to fiscal while the motive power segment benefited from strong market growth and selling price increases  the reserve power market showed only modest growth with little increase in selling prices 
we expanded our asian motive power business by focusing on both new sales initiatives and increasing manufacturing capabilities in our china plants 
gross profit fiscal fiscal increase in millions as net sales in millions as net sales in millions gross profit gross profit was unfavorably affected by significantly higher raw material costs in fiscal these costs were somewhat mitigated by the favorable effect of our lead hedging program  cost savings initiatives throughout the world in both our direct and indirect costs and sales price increases to our customers

operating expenses fiscal fiscal increase in millions as net sales in millions as net sales in millions operating expenses excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  operating expenses increased

our motive power segment  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  increased and our margin declined basis points 
as discussed above  our operating earnings were significantly affected by higher raw material costs offset by selling price increases and our continuing cost savings programs 
interest expense fiscal interest expense of million net of interest income of million increased over fiscal our average debt outstanding in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal our average interest rate incurred in fiscal was compared to in fiscal included in fiscal interest expense are non cash charges of million for deferred financing fees  compared to million in fiscal this decrease is due to the elimination of the accretion expense of the invensys seller notes in fiscal and lower deferred financing fees 
other charges included in our fiscal operating results are million of non operating highlighted charges that were incurred as a result of our ipo 
included in our fiscal operating results are million of non operating highlighted charges that were incurred primarily as a result of a settlement agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements and the march recapitalization transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details concerning these highlighted charges 
other income expense  net fiscal other income of million consists primarily of non operating foreign currency transaction gains of million 
this compares to fiscal other income of million  which consisted primarily of million in non operating foreign currency transaction gains 
both years transaction gains were primarily associated with certain debt instruments

income tax expense the fiscal effective income tax rate was compared to in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of a higher portion of our pretax earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than in fiscal net earnings fiscal net earnings were million compared to fiscal earnings of million 
excluding the million fiscal highlighted charges and the million fiscal highlighted charges  fiscal net earnings decreased million or 
the fiscal million increase in operating earnings excluding the fiscal highlighted charges was offset by the million increase in interest expense  the million decrease in other income  and the million increase in income taxes which reflects the elimination of the tax benefit recorded on the highlighted charges in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flow and financing activities cash and cash equivalents at march    and were million  million  and million respectfully

the million improvement in operating cash flow in fiscal was primarily from three areas 
spending of million in fiscal on our restructuring activities was lower than in fiscal by million 
accrued expenses and other liabilities excluding the effect from restructuring spending provided an improvement to cash flow of million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to substantially higher payments on these liabilities made in fiscal than in fiscal these improvements in operating cash flow were partially offset by an increase in cash used for primary working capital of million and million of miscellaneous other items such as changes in the deferred tax provision 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal was primarily for additional capacity and new products 
additionally  the company invested million in fiscal  primarily for the fiamm and gaz acquisitions 
cash provided by used in financing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million respectively 
the fiscal amount reflects the financing transactions related to the invensys settlement and the recapitalization 
the fiscal amount relates primarily to transactions related to the initial public offering of common stock 
the net proceeds from the fiscal offering were approximately million 
the net proceeds and million of other corporate funds were used to prepay the entire principal and accrued interest and prepayment penalty on our senior second lien term loan million and to prepay a portion million of our million senior secured term loan b in fiscal the fiscal amount relates primarily to the million euro million financing of the fiamm acquisition 
a 
table of contents in december  we entered into an agreement with invensys plc under which we paid million for the repurchase of seller notes and warrants delivered to invensys as part of the consideration for the esg acquisition and in settlement of other matters  primarily termination of a supply agreement 
the invensys settlement transaction was funded by utilizing million of short term investments  million of borrowings from an accounts receivable financing facility that was paid off on march   million additional tranche b borrowing and a million revolving note drawdown 
in connection with the recapitalization on march   we refinanced our previously existing credit facilities and entered into a new million senior secured credit facility  which consisted of a million senior secured term loan b and a million senior secured revolving credit facility  and entered into a new million senior second lien term loan 
we used the proceeds of the combined million in term loans to fund a cash payment to our existing stockholders and certain members of our management in the amount of million  refinance the majority of our existing debt and pay accrued interest in the total amount of million and to pay transaction costs of million 
no amounts were borrowed under the revolving credit line in conjunction with the cash payment 
the purpose of the million cash payment was to provide liquidity to our existing stockholders and management 
the decision to provide liquidity at such time was driven primarily by the strength of the debt capital markets at the time  as well as the speed and certainty of execution associated with the recapitalization 
in august  in order to take advantage of the company s lower leverage and resulting lower market borrowing costs after completion of the initial public offering  we amended our senior secured credit agreement and reduced our borrowing rates on the senior secured term loan b by 
the existing term loans million plus accrued interest were paid off and simultaneously new term loans of million were borrowed 
the million senior secured term loan b has a quarterly principal amortization and matures on march  the million senior secured revolving credit facility matures on march  borrowings under this credit agreement bears interest at a floating rate based  at our option  upon a libor rate plus an applicable percentage or the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate  plus an applicable percentage 
the average effective borrowing rate on our total debt for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on our interest rate swap agreements 
in march  we amended our senior secured credit agreement to permit the company s acquisition of the motive power battery business of fiamm spa and the secured financing for such acquisition 
additionally  the amendment revised the senior secured leverage ratio for the company s following six quarters 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this financing 
all obligations under the senior secured credit agreement are secured by  among other things  substantially all of our us assets 
our credit agreements contain various covenants which  absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations  or the receipt of waivers  would limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions  buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  pay dividends and take certain other actions 
we currently are in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our credit agreements 
since we believe that we will continue to comply with these covenants and conditions  we believe that we have adequate availability of funds to meet our expected cash requirements 
in addition to cash flows from operating activities  we had available credit lines of million at march  and million at march  to cover short term liquidity requirements 
on a long term basis  our senior secured revolving credit facility is committed through march  as long as we continue to comply with the covenants and conditions of the facility agreement 
included in our available credit lines at march   our senior secured revolving credit facility has availability for borrowing of million

contractual obligations and commercial commitments at march   we had certain cash obligations  which are due as follows total less than year to years to years after years in millions short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases pension and profit sharing restructuring total under our senior secured credit facility  we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million  million and million at march   and  respectively 
the amounts shown in the table above do not include interest charges on these cash obligations 
credit facilities and leverage our focus on working capital management and cash flow from operations is measured by our ability to reduce total debt and reduce our leverage ratios 
shown below are the leverage ratios in connection with our senior secured credit agreement for fiscal and our reduced leverage in fiscal reflects the use of proceeds from our ipo 
our increased leverage in fiscal reflects the borrowings to fund the fiamm and gaz acquisitions in june and october  respectively 
the total leverage ratio for fiscal is times adjusted ebitda non gaap as described below 
we believe our future operating cash flow  net of capital expenditures  will reduce total debt and our leverage ratios 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings to ebitda non gaap and adjusted ebitda non gaap fiscal fiscal net earnings as reported add back depreciation and amortization interest expense income tax expense ebitda non gaap adjustments per credit agreement definitions adjusted ebitda non gaap per credit agreements senior debt  net total debt  net leverage ratios senior debt adjusted ebitda ratio x x maximum ratio permitted x x total debt adjusted ebitda ratio x x maximum ratio permitted x x consolidated interest coverage ratio x x minimum ratio required x x a 
table of contents we have included ebitda and adjusted ebitda because management uses it as a key measure of our performance 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings or any other measure of performance under gaap as a measure of performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity 
our calculation of ebitda may be different from the calculations used by other companies  and therefore comparability may be limited 
certain financial covenants in our senior secured credit facility are based on ebitda  subject to adjustments  which is shown above 
because we have a significant amount of debt  and because continued availability of credit under our senior secured credit facility is critical to our ability to meet our business plan  we believe that an understanding of the key terms of our credit agreement is important to an investor s understanding of our financial condition and liquidity risks 
failure to comply with our financial covenants  unless waived by our lenders  would mean we could not borrow any further amounts under our revolving credit facility and would give our lenders the right to demand immediate repayment of all outstanding term and revolving credit loans 
we would be unable to continue our operations at current levels if we lost the liquidity provided under our credit agreements 
depreciation and amortization in this table excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs  which is included in interest expense 
the million of non operating expense adjustments in fiscal were incurred in connection with our ipo  which included a prepayment penalty of million and the write off of deferred financing costs of million 
the million of operating expense adjustments in fiscal included primarily million for equipment write offs and fixed asset impairment and a million adjustment for restructuring 
debt includes capital lease obligations and letters of credit issued under the senior secured credit facility and is net of us cash and cash equivalents 
senior debt excludes unsecured debt 
these ratios are included to show compliance with the leverage ratios set forth in our credit facilities 
we show both our current ratios and the maximum or minimum ratios permitted or minimum ratio required under our senior secured credit facility

new and proposed accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which supersedes sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
this statement focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  a public entity generally is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of an equity instrument based on the grant date fair value of the award  with such cost recognized over the applicable vesting period 
in addition  sfas r requires an entity to provide certain a 
table of contents disclosures in order to assist in understanding the nature of share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
the company was required to adopt the provisions of sfas r on april  under sfas no 
r  the company determined the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the permitted transition methods include the prospective  retrospective  or modified prospective methods 
the prospective method only relates to the options that were issued prior to the company s initial public offering that have historically been accounted for under the minimum value method 
such options continue to be accounted for under the provisions of apb opinion no 
under the retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retrospective method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period presented 
unvested options outstanding upon adoption that were accounted for under the minimum value method in accordance with sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 will continue to be accounted for under the minimum value method 
all other unvested options outstanding upon adoption will be accounted for under the modified prospective method 
the company has evaluated the requirements of sfas r and will be using the black scholes option pricing model to value all of its unvested stock options and the modified prospective method in applying the requirements of sfas no 
r 
the company expects to recognize additional compensation expense for of approximately million 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities however  in periods of abnormal high production  the amount of fixed overhead allocated to products is decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost 
the company was required to adopt these provisions on april  and has determined there will not be a material impact from sfas on the consolidated financial statements

our reserve power segment  which is dependant on growth in telecom  ups and aerospace defense  and included the results of gaz since its acquisition on october   posted solid year on year percentage gains in the first half of fiscal and double digit year on year percentage gains in the second half of fiscal fiscal net sales on a quarter to quarter sequential basis  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  showed decreases increases of approximately   and 
the generally favorable global economic conditions that we experienced in the latter part of fiscal continued to favorably impact our sales in fiscal historically  the sequential decline in the first quarter is typical of our business as our fourth quarter is generally our strongest 
our motive power segment saw solid year on year gains following our typical quarterly cycle 
our reserve power segment was generally stable throughout fiscal the change in the mix of reserve power and motive power sales to total sales during the quarterly periods within fiscal primarily reflects the addition of fiamm sales to the motive segment in the first quarter of the mix of reserve power and motive power sales to total sales did not fluctuate significantly during the quarterly periods within fiscal operating earnings fiscal operating earnings on a quarter to quarter sequential basis  excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and the highlighted charges in charges in the second and third quarters  showed decreases increases of approximately   and on a quarter to quarter sequential basis

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks enersys cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and raw material costs 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
enersys policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed 
interest rate risks we are exposed to changes in variable us interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreements 
on a selective basis  from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt 
such agreements effectively convert million of the company s variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis  utilizing the three month london interbank offered rate  or libor  as a floating rate reference 
fluctuations in libor and fixed rates affect both the company s net financial investment position and the amount of cash to be paid or received by it under these agreements 
the following commentary provides details for the million interest rate swap contracts in february  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on million of our floating rate debt through february   at per year 
in april and may  we amended these agreements to extend the maturity to february   and reduce the fixed rate to per year beginning may  in april  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on an additional million of floating rate debt through may  the fixed rates per year began may   and are during the first year  the second year  the third year and in the fourth year  which averages for the four year period 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix interest rates on an additional million of floating rate debt through may  the fixed rates per year began november   and are during the first year  the second year  the third year and in the fourth year  which averages for the three and one half year period 
in october  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on an additional million of floating rate debt through december  the fixed rates per year plus an applicable credit spread began december   and are during the first year  the second year  the third year  the fourth year  and in the fifth year  which averages for the five year period 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million 
commodity cost risks we have a significant risk in our exposure to certain raw materials  which we estimate were approximately half of total cost of goods sold for fiscal year and our largest single raw material cost is lead  for which the cost remains volatile 
to ensure a steady supply of lead and to mitigate against large increases in cost  we enter into contracts with our suppliers for the purchase of lead and forward contracts with financial institutions to hedge the price of lead 
a 
table of contents we had the following contracts at the dates shown below date s under contract pounds purchased average cost pound approximate of lead requirements in millions in millions march  march  march  based on the fiscal year lead requirements for the period then ended 
we estimate that a increase in our cost of lead over our estimated cost in fiscal would increase our annual total cost of goods sold by approximately million or of net sales 
foreign currency exchange rate risks the company manufactures and assembles its products primarily in china  france  germany  italy  mexico  poland  spain  the united kingdom  and the united states 
over half of the company s sales and expenses are translated in foreign currencies 
the company s sales revenue  production costs  profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where it manufactures or purchases goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where the company s products are sold 
additionally  as the company reports its financial statements in the us dollar  our financial results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where it has operations relative to the strength of the us dollar 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts business are the euro  british pound  polish zloty  mexican peso  canadian dollar and chinese renminbi 
we quantify and monitor our global foreign currency exposures 
on a selective basis we will enter into foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to reduce the volatility from currency movements that affect the company 
based primarily on statistical currency correlations on the company s exposures in fiscal  we are highly confident that the pretax effect on annual earnings of changes in the principal currencies in which we conduct our business would not be in excess of approximately million in more than one year out of twenty years 
our largest exposure is from the purchase and conversion of us dollar based lead costs into local currencies in europe  china and mexico 
additionally  we have currency exposures from intercompany trade transactions 
to hedge these exposures we have entered into forward contracts with financial institutions to fix the value at which we will buy or sell certain currencies 
each contract is for a period not extending beyond one year 
as of march   march  and march   we had entered into a total of million  and forward contracts  with the march  details as follows transactions hedged us equivalent in millions average rate hedged sell euros for us dollars sell uk pounds for us dollars buy polish zloty for euros sell canadian dollars for us dollars total foreign exchange translation adjustments are recorded on the consolidated condensed statements of comprehensive income 
based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedges  actual gains and losses in the future may differ from our historical results
