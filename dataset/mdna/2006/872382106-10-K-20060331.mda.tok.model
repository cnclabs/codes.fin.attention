item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis a royalty income is recorded when received  including the effect of overtaken or undertaken positions and negative or positive adjustments  by the corporate trustee on the last business day of each calendar quarter 
in addition  royalty income includes amounts related to funds deposited or released from the special cost escrow account see c  and b trust general and administrative expenses are recorded when paid  except for the cash reserved for future general and administrative expenses 
c the funds deposited or released from the special cost escrow account are recorded at the time of payment or receipt 
the special cost escrow account is an account of the working interest owners and is not reflected in the financial statements of the trust 
this manner of reporting income and expenses is considered to be the most meaningful because the quarterly distributions to unit holders are based on net cash receipts received from the working interest owners 
the financial statements of the trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  because  under such principles  royalty income and trust general and administrative expenses for a quarter would be recognized on an accrual basis 
in addition  amortization of the net overriding royalty interest  calculated on a units of production basis  is charged directly to trust corpus since such amount does not affect distributable income 
the trustees  including the corporate trustee  have no authority over  have not evaluated and make no statement concerning  the internal control over financial reporting of the working interest owner 
liquidity and capital resources the trust s source of capital is the royalty income received from its share of the net proceeds from the royalty properties 
reference is made to note in the notes to financial statements under item of this form k  which contains certain unaudited supplemental reserve information  for an estimate of future royalty income attributable to the partnership  of which the trust has a interest 
substantial uncertainties exist with regard to future oil and gas prices  which are subject to material fluctuations due to changes in production levels and pricing and other actions taken by major petroleum producing nations  as well as the regional supply and demand for gas  weather  industrial growth  conservation measures  competition and other variables 
in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement  generally all net proceeds received by the trust  net of trust general and administrative expenses and any cash reserves established for the payment of contingent or future obligations of the trust  are distributed currently to the unit holders 
in  in anticipation of future periods when the cash received from the royalty may not be sufficient for payment of trust expenses  the trust determined  in accordance with the trust agreement  to begin further increasing the trust s cash reserve each quarter 
in the first quarter of  the trust determined that the trust s cash reserve was currently sufficient to provide for future administrative expenses in connection with the winding up of the trust 
the trust determined that a cash reserve equal to three times the average expenses of the trust during each of the past three years was sufficient at this time to provide for future administrative expenses in connection with the winding up of the trust 
the reserve amount at december  and was  and  respectively 
during the first and second quarters of  the trust used  and  respectively  from the trust s cash reserve account to pay the trust s general and administrative expenses when insufficient royalty income was received by the trust 
operations the following operational information has been based on information provided to the corporate trustee by chevron as the managing general partner of the partnership and by the applicable working interest owners 
the trustees have no control over these operations or internal controls relating to this information 
at the end of october  approximately half of chevron oil equivalent production in the gulf of mexico remained shut in due to damages from hurricanes in the third quarter 
the time it will take to resume this production is uncertain  and some of the volumes may not be sufficiently economic to restore 
the impact to the trust properties is estimated to be a reduction in production 
eugene island remains shut in  but production is currently expected to resume later in after a new sales platform is built by the operator to replace the eugene island sales platform destroyed by hurricane rita  and assuming transportation availability is fully restored on a third party transmission pipeline that incurred significant hurricane related damages 
the operator of this pipeline has advised that hurricane related damages on their pipeline are more extensive than previously thought  and the working interest owner has advised the trustee that it is currently evaluating various alternatives for transportation as production is also restored 
on ship shoal  gas production remains shut in due to the tennessee gas pipeline being down 
major repairs are underway and gas production on ship shoal is expected to resume in the second quarter of on west cameron  production has remained shut in since september following hurricane rita s major damage to various platforms  but gas production on this field is expected to resume in mid years and royalty income increased approximately from  in to  in primarily due to an increase in gas revenues and crude oil and condensate revenues as discussed below 
for and  the trust had no undistributed net income or loss 
undistributed net income represents positive net proceeds generated during the period that were applied to an existing loss carryforward 
undistributed net loss represents negative net proceeds generated during the respective period 
an undistributed net loss is carried forward and offset  in future periods  by positive net proceeds earned by the related working interest owner s 
volumes and dollar amounts discussed below represent amounts recorded by the working interest owners unless otherwise specified 
natural gas and gas products natural gas revenues and gas products decreased from  in to  in  partially offset by a increase in the average price received for natural gas from per mcf in to mcf in natural gas and gas products volumes decreased from  mcf in to  mcf in the working interest owners of the east cameron property advised the trust that  as of october    mcf had been overtaken by the working interest owners from those properties 
in addition  the working interest owners of the east cameron and the west cameron properties advised the trust that  as of october   mcf and  mcf respectively  had been undertaken from these properties 
the partnership s share of revenues related to the overtaken gas was included in the partnership s royalty income in the periods during which the gas was sold 
during  all cumulative gas imbalances with the trust were settled with the working interest owner 
during the first quarter of  chevron informed the trustees that it would make downward adjustments to revenues and production based on an improper credit to the trust of revenues and production on eugene island this improper credit relates to production credited from wells in which the trust has no interest from as early as june through october the aggregate amount of these adjustments are expected to be approximately  barrels of oil or  for oil revenues  as well as  mcf or  for gas revenues 
recovery by chevron of these amounts  as well as certain capital expenditures discussed below  affected royalty income and distributable income in the first and second quarters of crude oil and condensate crude oil and condensate revenues increased from  in to  in  due primarily to a increase in crude oil and condensate volumes from  barrels in to  barrels in additionally  average crude oil and condensate prices increased by from in to in operating and capital expenditures operating expenses paid by the working interest owners decreased from  in to  in capital expenditures paid by the working interest owners decreased from  in to  in special cost escrow account the special cost escrow account is an account of the working interest owners  and it is described herein for information purposes only 
the conveyance provides for the reserve of funds for estimated future special costs of plugging and abandoning wells  dismantling platforms and other costs of abandoning the royalty properties  as well as for the estimated amount of future drilling projects and other capital expenditures on the royalty properties 
as provided in the conveyance  the amount of funds to be reserved is determined based on factors  including estimates of aggregate future production costs  aggregate future special costs  aggregate future net revenues and actual current net proceeds 
deposits into this account reduce current distributions and are placed in an escrow account and invested in short term certificates of deposit 
such account is herein referred to as the special cost escrow account 
the trust s share of interest generated from the special cost escrow account   and  in and  respectively serves to reduce the trust s share of allocated production costs 
special cost escrow funds will generally be utilized to pay special costs to the extent there are not adequate current net proceeds to pay such costs 
special costs that have been paid are no longer included in the special cost escrow calculation 
deposits to the special cost escrow account will generally be made when the balance in the special cost escrow account is less than of future special costs and there is a net revenues shortfall a calculation of the excess of estimated future costs over estimated future net revenues pursuant to a formula contained in the conveyance 
when there is not a net revenues shortfall  amounts in the special cost escrow account will generally be released  to the extent that special costs have been incurred 
amounts in the special cost escrow account will also be released when the balance in such account exceeds of estimated future special costs
