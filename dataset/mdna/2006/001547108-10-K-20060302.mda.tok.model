 resulted in the company recording a charge of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operations overview the company s continuing operations consist of seven steelmaking and finishing plants that produce flat rolled carbon steels  including premium quality coated  cold rolled and hot rolled products  and specialty stainless and electrical steels that are sold in slab  hot band  sheet and strip form 
these products are sold primarily to the domestic automotive  appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  as well as to distributors  service centers and converters 
the company s continuing operations also include two plants operated by ak tube llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which further finishes flat rolled carbon and stainless steel into welded steel tubing 
in addition  the company operates european trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products 
safety and quality are hallmarks of ak steel s operations 
ak steel has led the steel industry in safety performance for many years 
in  the company experienced its best ever safety performance and received 
table of contents several safety awards 
similarly  the company has been recognized repeatedly in leading surveys for being industry best in overall customer satisfaction 
in  ak steel was ranked first in customer satisfaction in a leading industry survey of key automotive  appliance and service center customers  not just with respect to carbon steel but also with respect to specialty products 
the company also had its overall best ever performance with respect to quality  with most of its plants setting new records in various quality metrics  and received a variety of quality awards from customers and others in all of the company s steel plants have been awarded iso ts quality management system certification  which is an international quality management system standard developed by the international automotive task force and the japan automobile manufacturers association in conjunction with the international standards community 
all of the company s steel facilities also have been awarded certificates of registration under iso  a set of voluntary standards that enable an organization to control the impact of its activities  products or services on the environment 
audits to maintain these certifications are performed on a periodic and timely basis  and the company continues to be iso ts and iso certified 
the company completed or announced several capital projects in which should have a favorable ongoing impact on its operations and financial results 
in july  the company completed the installation of a new vacuum degasser and the modification of the continuous caster at its ashland works 
this project enables the company to more closely match its steel production capabilities with customer requirements for ultra low carbon steel products  primarily for the automotive and appliance markets 
in october  the company completed the construction of a new recycling facility at its ashland works 
the facility can process and recycle waste materials from the plant s blast furnace  cokemaking operation and continuous caster and reuse the products in the company s steelmaking process 
the new facility is capable of recycling up to  tons of waste per year and recovering iron and carbon units that would otherwise be sent to a landfill 
the use of the recycled materials will reduce the amount of purchased raw materials needed for the ashland works steelmaking process 
in addition  in december  the company announced that it will invest approximately million in its ak tube facility to enable it to produce large diameter stainless tubing 
on march  the company completed the sale of douglas dynamics  llc  the largest north american manufacturer of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders for four wheel drive light trucks 
on april  the company completed the sale of greens port industrial park on the houston  texas ship channel 
for all periods presented  the results of douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park are classified as discontinued operations 
financial results overview with an environment of improved customer relations  an improving economy and the realization of cost savings from initiatives that management began in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced significant improvements in in its shipments  sales and operating results  excluding the effect of certain non cash charges discussed in more detail below 
both net sales and shipments increased over and established new records for the company in the average selling price for the company s products rose to per ton 
the improvement in operating results enabled the company to continue to improve its cash position  ending the year with of cash and of availability under its two credit facilities  representing total liquidity of  although operating results improved in  there also were continued financial challenges 
the company had to contend with large  unprecedented increases in the costs for raw materials and energy in as a result  the cost of products sold increased by from the prior year 
due to competitive forces  the company was not able to recoup a portion of those increased costs through price increases 
also  because of the nature of its business  the company continues to incur significant costs to comply with stringent  and in some instances new  environmental regulations 
for example  the company is investing approximately to install new environmental equipment at its middletown works to comply with newly enacted regulations governing particulate emissions 
the first phase of that project was completed in 
table of contents the company was able to partially overcome these increased costs in by improving productivity and quality  lowering operating and overhead costs  reducing discretionary spending wherever prudent  and where possible  adding surcharges to the price of carbon  stainless and electrical steel product sales 
overall  management of the company is very pleased with the progress made in and the ongoing efforts of its employees throughout the company to help the company make progress toward its goal of returning to sustained profitability 
key factors generally impacting financial results ak steel s financial results are primarily affected by its operating levels and resulting shipments  selling prices  production costs  raw material and energy costs  mix of products sold to the company s various markets along with significant pension and other postretirement benefits costs 
in addition  the company s results are also affected by the overall cyclical nature of the steel industry and global steel competition 
a significant factor often affecting the cycle is the performance of the general economy 
the industry was particularly hard hit by the economic downturn that continued until the end of a number of steel companies  including large and small competitors of ak steel  filed for bankruptcy protection during that downturn 
nonetheless  the level of domestic competition that the company faces remains high 
many of the steelmaking assets of these bankrupt companies were purchased through the bankruptcy process 
the acquiring companies which now operate these assets are able to enjoy cost advantages resulting principally from the elimination of large portions of their predecessors retiree pension and healthcare costs  a reduced workforce and a significant reduction in the number of job classes resulting in more cost effective operations 
the relative competition from these lower cost competitors can impact the company s operating results and financial condition from year to year 
the steel industry also continues to be impacted by both the consolidation of competitors globally and competition from foreign steel companies 
in addition  the steel industry is being impacted by the production and consumption of steel in china which has contributed to the recent price volatility in the steel industry 
notwithstanding this strong competition  demand for steel products currently is relatively strong in the major markets that the company serves 
compared to shipments steel shipments in were a company record  tons  compared to  tons in the year to year increase was primarily a result of increased shipments of hot rolled carbon steel products 
the increase in hot rolled shipments was due to a stronger market for those products in general and higher production levels at the company s hot strip mill which allowed the company to take advantage of that stronger market 
the decision to increase hot rolled shipments resulted in a reduction in both coated and cold rolled shipments 
shipments of stainless electrical products declined primarily as the result of reduced shipments of commodity chrome nickel stainless products 
this decline in commodity chrome nickel stainless products is the result of the company adjusting its product mix and customer portfolio objectives to enhance the overall profitability of stainless products by continuing to reduce its participation in the lower margin commodity chrome nickel stainless products 
the tubular shipments declined slightly as the result of a decline in for the construction and service center markets 
overall  value added products comprised of total shipments for  down from for tons shipped by product category for and were as follows tons in thousands stainless electrical coated cold rolled tubular subtotal value added shipments hot rolled secondary subtotal non value added shipments total shipments 
table of contents net sales net sales in also were a company record  compared to  in the year to year increase was due primarily to higher shipment volumes and higher contract pricing  particularly for electrical steel sales  partially offset by lower stainless steel volume and lower spot market pricing 
average selling prices increased to per ton in from per ton in  due to general price increases for most of the company s products and raw material and energy surcharges on a portion of the sales  primarily in the spot market 
the price increases reflected the global increase in demand for steel  and  along with the surcharges  were needed to address the unprecedented increases in the costs of energy and certain key raw materials which the company experienced in the company was only able to implement variable pricing on approximately half of its contract sales in  which represented approximately of its total sales for the year 
as a result of the increased prices for electrical and certain other high end non automotive products  and resulting higher revenues  the company s automotive sales declined to about of total sales 
sales attributable to major market groups as a percent of total sales for and were as follows automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and converters operating profit loss and adjusted operating profit the company s reported operating profit for the year was as compared to an operating loss of for included in both of these annual results were large pre tax  primarily non cash charges  which are described more fully below 
if those charges are excluded  the company s adjusted operating profits for the years and would be and  respectively 
exclusion of the non cash charges  discussed below  from the operating results is presented in order to clarify the effects of those charges on the company s operating results and to more clearly reflect the operating performance of the company on a comparative basis for and the excluded charges consist of pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges the corridor charges  asset and equity investment impairment charges and a pension curtailment charge 
the corridor charges are recorded in the fourth quarter in accordance with the method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits which the company adopted as a result of its merger with armco inc in while these corridor charges have recurred over the past five years  it is nearly impossible to reliably forecast or predict whether they will occur in future years or  if they do  at what magnitude 
they are taken only in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and are driven mainly by events and circumstances beyond the company s control  primarily changes in interest rates  health care cost trends  and mortality and retirement assumptions 
additional information concerning these corridor charges is contained in the asset impairment and pension opeb charges section below 
the curtailment charge is the result of the new labor agreement that the company recently entered into with the represented employees at the company s ashland works 
under this agreement  the existing defined benefit pension plan was locked and frozen as of january   with subsequent company pension contributions being made to the steelworkers pension trust 
as a result  the company was required to recognize in the past service pension expense that previously would have been amortized 
this agreement extends until and therefore no further curtailment charge is anticipated to recur for the duration of the agreement 
additional information concerning these charges is contained in the asset impairment and pension opeb charges section below 
the asset and equity investment impairment charges are the result of idling or closing facilities which the company does not currently foresee having a need to use 
the actions resulting in the write offs will better 
table of contents position the company for the future by further consolidating and rationalizing its operations to be more cost effective and allowing for the maximization of the productivity of its other operations 
the company has reviewed all of its assets carefully and does not believe that it is reasonably likely that further asset impairments will occur within the foreseeable future 
additional information concerning this charge is contained in the asset impairment and pension opeb charges section below 
management believes that reporting operating profit and loss on an adjusted basis  which is a non gaap financial measure  more clearly reflects the company s current operating results and provides investors with a better understanding of the company s overall financial performance 
in addition  the adjusted operating results facilitate the ability to compare the company s financial results to those of our competitors 
management views the reported results of adjusted operating profit loss as an important operating performance measure  and as such  believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is operating profit loss 
adjusted operating profit loss is used by management as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of the business 
management believes that this non gaap measure  when analyzed in conjunction with the company s gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations  provides additional insight into the financial trends of the company s business versus the gaap results alone 
management also believes that investors and potential investors in the company s securities should not rely on adjusted operating income as a substitute for any gaap financial measure and the company encourages investors and potential investors to review the reconciliations of adjusted operating profit loss to the comparable gaap financial measure 
while management believes that the non gaap measures allow for comparability to competitors  the most significant limitation on that comparison is that the company immediately recognizes the pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges in the fourth quarter of the current year 
the company s competitors do not recognize these pension and other postretirement costs immediately  but instead  amortize these costs over future years 
management compensates for the limitations of this non gaap financial measure by recommending that these non gaap measures be evaluated in conjunction with the gaap financial measures 
the following table reflects the reconciliation of non gaap financial measures for the full year and results reconciliation of operating profit loss to adjusted operating profit operating profit loss  as reported pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges asset impairment charges curtailment charge adjusted operating profit operating costs operating costs in and were  and  respectively 
operating costs for were negatively affected by higher steelmaking input costs  including for energy and certain raw materials 
compared to  costs for natural gas  iron ore  coal  and purchased slabs increased by nearly million in this increase was partially offset by the company s continued and successful efforts to reduce its controllable operating costs by reducing the number of employees and improving operating efficiencies on existing production units 
as a result of the progressively increasing cost of raw materials  the company recorded lifo charges in both and  although those charges decreased to from  year over year 
in addition  the company incurred a decrease in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses excluding the corridor charge discussed below 
the company also received a foreign trade duty payment of in operating costs in also were impacted by approximately of expenses over related primarily to blast furnace outages at both its ashland and middletown works 

table of contents selling and administrative expense the company s selling and administrative expense increased in  as the result of slightly higher expenses related to retiree benefits 
depreciation expense depreciation expense declined to in as the result of recent years decline in capital spending 
goodwill impairment the company is required to annually review its goodwill for possible impairment 
the and annual reviews did not result in any additional goodwill impairment for the company 
asset impairment and pension opeb charges in the fourth quarter of  ak isg steel coating company  a joint venture that operates an electrogalvanizing line in cleveland  oh made the decision to indefinitely idle that facility effective march  the company has determined that it is now able to fully satisfy its electrogalvanizing requirements  under prevailing market conditions  solely through its own facilities 
as a result  the company fully impaired this investment  resulting in a charge of in the company also recorded an impairment charge of related to certain previously idled stainless processing equipment at its butler works and mansfield works 
the company determined that it is now able to support its stainless markets through operating efficiencies at its other processing facilities 
these actions will better position the company for the future by further consolidating and rationalizing its operations to be more cost effective and allowing for the maximization of the productivity of its other operations 
the company has reviewed all of its assets carefully and does not believe that it is reasonably likely that further asset impairments will occur within the foreseeable future 
under the method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans which the company adopted at the time of its merger with armco inc in  the company recognized fourth quarter non cash charges in and of and  respectively 
under this method of accounting  the company is required to recognize into its results of operations  as a fourth quarter noncash corridor adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans  or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
the effect of prevailing interest rates on the discount rate used to value projected plan obligations as of the october measurement date is one of the more important factors used to determine the company s year end liability  fourth quarter corridor adjustment and subsequent year s expense for these benefit plans 
an increase in health care costs caused the company to record a fourth quarter corridor charge of related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
in  the company also recorded a net credit to equity of to recognize its minimum pension liability 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion of funding requirements and pending pension legislation 
the company also recognized a fourth quarter curtailment charge in of related to the new labor contract recently negotiated with the represented employees at the company s ashland works 
under that agreement  the existing defined benefit pension plan was locked and frozen as of january   with subsequent company pension contributions being made to the steelworkers pension trust spt 
as a result  the company is required to recognize in the past service pension expense that previously would have been amortized 
on balance  the future benefits associated with the new labor contract  including the locking and freezing of the defined benefit plans and increased active and retiree healthcare cost sharing  will outweigh the one time fourth quarter curtailment charge and the ongoing contributions to the spt 

table of contents interest expense the company s interest expense for of was lower than in due primarily to reduction of debt in  lower fees associated with the company s credit facilities and higher capitalized interest associated with an increase in major capital projects in other income the company s other income for of was higher than due primarily to increased interest income from higher rates on increased levels of cash 
deferred tax valuation allowances in order to fully recognize the deferred tax asset recorded in its financial statements  the company must generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize its carryforwards before they expire 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that  in management s judgment  is more likely than not to be realized 
in  the company reversed previously impaired valuation allowances of its deferred tax assets in the amount of as a result of a significant improvement in its financial results 
discontinued operations in  the company sold douglas dynamics  llc for before fees and expenses  and recognized a net gain of  or per share  and sold its greens port industrial park for  before fees and expenses and recognized a net gain of  or per share 
the results of douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park are classified as discontinued operations 
the total gain on the sale of discontinued operations for was  or per share  and was due primarily to the asset sales mentioned above 
net income loss during and the company s net loss in was  or per diluted share 
in  the company reported net income of  or per diluted share 
there are several factors to which the difference is principally attributable 
negatively impacting the comparison was the absence in of the gain recognized in on the sale of discontinued operations  discussed above  and the absence in of the benefit recognized in related to the reversal of previously established tax valuation allowances  discussed above 
in  the company also incurred a income tax provision charge due to state tax law changes that became effective in only partially offsetting those negative factors was the year to year reduction in the company s non cash charges  discussed above 
in  the total of the other postretirement benefit corridor charge  asset impairment charges and curtailment charge was in  there were no asset impairment or curtailment charges  but the pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges totaled cumulative effect of accounting change on december   the date of adoption of fasb interpretation no

the resulting cumulative effect of adopting this statement was  net of tax of compared to shipments steel shipments in and were  tons and  tons  respectively 
the year to year increase was primarily a result of strong demand from customers in the automotive  appliance  construction and 
table of contents manufacturing markets along with strong demand from spot market service center customers 
value added products comprised of total shipments for  up from for on significantly higher shipments of coated and cold rolled carbon steel products 
in addition  improved conditions in the stainless and electrical steel markets contributed to a increase in tons shipped for these products as compared to hot rolled shipments declined as a result of the company s focus on producing and shipping more cold rolled and coated shipments based on current steel market conditions

average selling prices increased to per ton in from per ton in due to general price increases and raw material and energy surcharges  both primarily on sales in the spot market 
the price increases reflect the global increase in demand for steel  while the surcharges were initiated in an effort to recover a portion of unprecedented increases in the costs of energy  particularly natural gas  and certain key raw materials  including nickel  chrome  steel scrap  purchased slabs  coal and coke 
during  the percentage of the company s sales attributable to the spot market primarily distributors  service centers and converters increased significantly as the result of higher steel prices and the implementation of raw material and energy surcharges

the pension and other postretirement benefit corridor 
table of contents charges are recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the company s unique method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits 
while these corridor adjustments have recurred over the past four years  it is nearly impossible to reliably forecast or predict whether they will re occur in future years or  if they do  at what magnitude 
they are taken only in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and are driven mainly by events and circumstances beyond the company s control  primarily changes in interest rates  health care cost trends  and mortality and retirement assumptions

operating costs in were also impacted by of expenses related to blast furnace outages 
operating costs in were also unfavorably impacted by an planned middletown works blast furnace maintenance outage and a write off of equipment at the middletown works  including a sinter plant following a change to a type of iron ore pellet that avoids the need to produce high cost sinter 
during  the company also recognized start up costs of for an ashland works coke battery that had been on hot idle  but which  upon its restart resulted in substantially higher savings compared to the current high costs of purchasing coke 
results in also were adversely affected by of expenses incurred in connection with the company s unsuccessful efforts to acquire the assets of national steel corporation 
selling and administrative expense as previously discussed  the company reduced its selling and administrative expense significantly in  primarily as a result of an approximate target reduction in its salaried workforce initiated in depreciation expense depreciation expense declined to in as the result of recent years decline in capital spending

the company also recorded an charge for the early retirement of this debt 
goodwill the company is required to annually review its goodwill for possible impairment 
in  recognizing continued softness in the carbon  stainless and electrical steel markets  which affected pricing  volumes  and high raw material and energy costs  in addition to other factors  management determined that the fair value of the company s flat rolled steel reporting unit had declined 
as a result  in  the company recognized a non cash impairment charge of the remaining goodwill at december  includes of goodwill related to ak tube s acquisition of arvinmeritor s central tubing facility 
the annual review did not result in any additional goodwill impairment for the company 
deferred tax valuation allowances in order to fully recognize the deferred tax asset recorded on its financial statements related to net operating loss carryforwards  the company must generate taxable income sufficient to utilize its carryforwards before they expire 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in  a forecast of lower projected taxable income indicated that a decrease in the deferred tax asset was necessary and the company recognized an non cash charge to record an additional valuation allowance 
in  the company experienced significant improvement in its financial results and  as a result  was able to reverse valuation allowances taken in prior years  resulting in a tax benefit in of 
table of contents investment impairment in  the company performed an impairment review of the carrying amount of two businesses accounted for as cost investments 
based on the company s review of their business plans and future prospects  it determined that the carrying amount of its investments in these two businesses were impaired and recognized charges in other income expense totaling to write down the investments to their estimated fair values 
discontinued operations in  the company sold douglas dynamics  llc for before fees and expenses  and recognized a net gain of  or per share  and sold its greens port industrial park for  before fees and expenses and recognized a net gain of  or per share

the improvement in the results was due primarily to a robust spot market and the successful implementation of raw material and energy surcharges on spot market sales  lower operating costs  the gain on the sale of discontinued operations  and the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances taken in prior years 
outlook all of the statements in this outlook section are subject to  and qualified by  the information set forth beginning on page under the heading forward looking statements 
for the first quarter of  the company expects to ship between  and  tons  with the average selling price increasing by approximately from the fourth quarter of the projected increase in average selling price is primarily the result of increases in pricing from contract customers 
the company also expects first quarter raw material costs to rise from fourth quarter levels and expects its natural gas costs to remain essentially flat 
in addition  the company anticipates a lifo charge in due to expected increases in raw material and energy costs  a portion of which will be taken in the first quarter 
taking all of these factors into account  the company expects to generate operating profit in the first quarter of between and per shipped ton 
while it is not possible yet to reliably forecast the company s financial performance for all of  management believes that steps taken or announced in have laid a foundation for strong financial performance by the company in these steps include in  ak steel negotiated a new era labor agreement with the union at its ashland works 
in january  the company s ak tube llc subsidiary also announced that it had negotiated such an agreement with the represented workforce at its walbridge  oh plant 
these new agreements include reduced job classifications to provide more flexibility and cost savings  cost sharing of health care benefits and no base force guarantees 
with the ashland works agreement  there was also a significant pension benefit savings to the company 
the company negotiated overall price increases with its contract customers throughout the company will get the full annual benefit of those price increases for the first time in and will continue to build on them by seeking additional increases from its customers as contracts are renewed during the company took steps in to diversify its automotive customer base and spread its business among a broader group of automotive companies  including new and increased business with the foreign based automotive companies building vehicles in the united states 

table of contents the company installed a new vacuum degasser and modified the continuous caster at the its ashland works 
this project enables the company to more closely match its steel production capabilities with customer requirements for ultra low carbon steel products  primarily for the automotive and appliance markets  and enables the company to avoid paying the premium typically associated with purchase of degassed slabs 
the company constructed a new recycling facility at the its ashland works 
this facility can process and recycle waste materials from the plant s blast furnace  cokemaking operation and continuous caster and reuse the products in the company s steelmaking process 
it is capable of recycling up to  tons of waste per year and recovering iron and carbon units that would otherwise be sent to a landfill 
that reduces the need for the company to purchase those iron units and eliminates the cost of sending the waste containing them to a landfill 
the company will expand its production capacity in for grain oriented electrical steels through a combination of small  targeted capital investments at existing production lines and by introducing innovative operating practices 
the outlook for grain oriented electrical steel remains very strong  with demand continuing to grow for the company s energy efficient products used in power generation and distribution transformers 
the company substantially reduced its operating costs in through a variety of projects to improve efficiencies  reduce consumption of raw materials and energy  and other cost saving measures 
the savings from those cost reductions will continue in the company will invest approximately million in its ak tube facility to allow for the production of large diameter stainless tubing 
this new capital investment further enhances ak tube s industry leading technology by helping it meet new market requirements for large diameter stainless tubing for heavy duty truck exhaust components 
this market expansion is being driven by new federal environmental standards which will become effective january  construction of the new tubing mill is expected to be completed by mid in  the company continued to enhance its ability to secure its raw material requirements 
in october  the company entered into a year take or pay long term supply agreement with quebec cartier mining company qcm for the purchase of iron ore pellets 
this contract provides for the purchase of a significant portion of the company s iron ore needs from qcm 
the purchase price of the pellets is adjustable annually based on the then market price 
in august  the company entered into an agency agreement with tube city  llc for the purchase of ferrous scrap for all of the company s steelmaking facilities 
as part of the agreement  tube city is responsible for negotiating the majority of carbon scrap and pig iron purchases for ak steel plants in ashland  ky  butler  pa  and mansfield and middletown  oh 
this contractual arrangement is expected to produce cost savings to the company related to its scrap purchases 
the company made a million voluntary contribution to its pension trust fund in january as a result  the company now anticipates that its pension funding obligation in will be approximately see liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion of future pension funding requirements 
offsetting some of the benefits of these positive factors  however  are anticipated significant increases in the cost of energy  principally natural gas  and certain raw materials in although the company has made progress in its strategy to secure contracts for long term supplies of raw materials at competitive prices  many of those contracts include forms of variable pricing 
thus  while the company will have the raw materials its needs  it continues to be exposed to the risk of increases in the global price for many of those raw materials 
the company so far has had only limited success in recouping those cost increases directly through surcharges 
the company currently is anticipating another significant annual increase in the cost of energy and certain raw materials in 
table of contents the benefits of the company s cost saving efforts addressed above also may be mitigated by changes in the selling price of the company s steel products in currently  the outlook for the sale of the company s high end  grain oriented electrical steel products appears likely to be very strong throughout current demand for the company s other value added products also remains strong  but is more difficult to forecast for the duration of the outlook for the company in also may be affected by the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements at its largest two facilities  middletown works in ohio and butler works in pennsylvania 
in addition  the collective bargaining agreement at its zanesville works also expires in collectively  the unions at these three facilities represent approximately  of the company s total of  represented employees 
the company believes it is imperative that it secure competitive new era labor agreements with the represented workers at these facilities  as it has done with the represented workers at six other of its facilities over the course of the past two years 
the inability of the company and the union to timely reach a new collective bargaining agreement at any of these facilities could result in a work stoppage 
while the company has contingency plans to operate its facilities in the event of a work stoppage  there remains a risk that a work stoppage nonetheless could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results 
the middletown works labor agreement expired on february  and the parties were unable prior to its expiration to reach a new agreement 
effective march   the company elected to exercise its right to prevent the represented employees at the middletown works from continuing to work without a labor agreement 
the company has implemented its contingency plan to operate the middletown works with temporary replacement workers and salaried employees 
the potential exists that the company may also face a corridor charge which would not be recognized until the fourth quarter of under the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plan accounting method  the annual determination of a fourth quarter corridor adjustment  if any  is made as of the plans october measurement date 
since the balance of deferred actuarial losses for all major pension and other postretirement benefit plans was at or near the edge of the corridor at the end of  the development of any additional net actuarial losses which could result from a decline in interest rates  poor investment returns or adverse changes in assumptions would likely result in another corridor charge in the fourth quarter of whether or not such a charge will be recognized and  if so  the amount of such a charge cannot be reliably predicted or estimated at this time 
other factors which are relevant to the company s outlook include the following the company estimates that depreciation expense will be approximately in compared to in as the result of the major capital investments made in capital investments in are estimated to be approximately  of which the two largest projects include the completion of the middletown works mact project and the installation of a new large diameter stainless tube mill at ak tube llc 
in  the company had planned major outages at both its ashland and middletown blast furnaces 
the company currently does not anticipate future planned outages on these furnaces until liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had of cash and cash equivalents  of availability under a accounts receivable purchase credit facility and of availability under a five year senior revolving credit facility that is secured by certain of the company s inventories 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either credit facility  however  availability under the facilities was reduced by due to outstanding letters of credit and reduced pools of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
availability under both facilities fluctuates monthly based on the varying levels of eligible collateral 
the company has no significant scheduled debt payments due until in and  the company has senior notes due of and  respectively 
during  cash generated by operating activities of continuing operations totaled  due primarily to higher shipment volumes and prices in average selling prices increased to per ton in  an 
table of contents increase of per ton over levels 
cost of products sold  however  increased approximately as a result of a significant rise in the prices paid for raw materials  particularly iron ore  coal  coke  purchased slabs  and energy  primarily natural gas  as well as higher shipping levels 
the company generated a net of cash from accounts receivable  inventories  current liabilities and other assets 
this was due primarily to the lower level of receivables  a higher level of accounts payable associated with improved payment terms and higher input costs  partially offset by an increase in inventories associated with the increased inventory costs and levels 
management believes that the company s receivable  inventory and current liability levels are appropriate in the current business environment and expects a modest net increase of these items in as a result of expected higher sales and higher raw material costs 
during january the company made a voluntary contribution to its pension trust of the company is required to make an approximate in pension contributions during currently  the company estimates required payments for and to be in the ranges of and  respectively 
the calculation of estimated future pension contributions requires the use of assumptions concerning future events 
the most significant of these assumptions relate to future investment performance of the pension funds  actuarial data relating to plan participants and the benchmark interest rate used to discount future benefits to their present value 
because of the variability of factors underlying these assumptions  including the possibility of future pension legislation  the reliability of estimated future pension contributions decreases as the length of time until the contributions must be made increases 
for a more detailed discussion of these estimates  see employee benefit obligations  below 
cash used by investing activities in totaled  which reflects of capital investments partially offset by of proceeds from the draw on industrial revenue bonds for the middletown works mact project 
the higher level of capital investments is associated with the installation of the new vacuum degasser and the modification of the continuous caster at the company s ashland works 
cash generated by financing activities in totaled reflecting no major financing activities in the company believes that its current liquidity will be adequate to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future 
future liquidity requirements for employee benefit plan contributions  scheduled debt maturities and capital investments are expected to be funded by internally generated cash and or other financing sources 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to generate or obtain all of the necessary liquidity if there is a material deterioration in the steel industry or the overall economy 
the company s forward looking statement on liquidity is based on currently available information and  to the extent the information is inaccurate  there could be a material adverse impact to the company s liquidity 
dividends the payment of cash dividends is subject to a restrictive covenant contained in the instruments governing most of the company s outstanding senior notes and in its inventory based revolving credit facility 
the covenant in its senior notes allows the payment of dividends  if declared by the board of directors  and the redemption or purchase of shares of its outstanding capital stock  subject to a formula that reflects cumulative net earnings 
as a result of cumulative losses recorded over the last three years  the company is unable to pay a dividend or redeem stock under this formula 
in addition  a restriction in the company s inventory based revolving credit facility limits dividends to annually 
financial covenants the indentures governing the company s outstanding senior notes and the agreements governing its two revolving credit facilities contain restrictions and covenants that may limit the company s operating flexibility 
the senior note indentures include restrictive covenants regarding a the use of proceeds from asset sales  b 
table of contents some investments  c the amount of sale leaseback transactions  and d transactions by subsidiaries and with affiliates 
furthermore  the senior note indentures impose the following additional financial covenants a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least to for the incurrence of debt 
failure to currently meet this covenant would limit the amount of additional debt the company can incur to approximately at december   the ratio was approximately to this number is calculated by dividing the interest expense  including capitalized interest and fees on letters of credit  into ebitda defined  essentially  as operating income i before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and restricted stock  extraordinary items and purchase accounting and asset distributions  ii adjusted for income before income taxes for discontinued operations  and iii reduced for the charges related to impairment of goodwill special charges  and pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligation corridor charges 
these corridor charges are then amortized over a year period for this calculation 
a limitation on restricted payments  which consist primarily of dividends and share repurchases  to plus of cumulative net income or minus of cumulative net loss from april  the company s inventory based revolving credit facility contains restrictions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of capital stock  the incurrence of debt  the amount of sale leaseback transactions  the acquisition and sale of assets  and the amount of annual capital expenditures 
also  the facility requires maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio  if average availability falls below capital investments the company anticipates capital investments of approximately  which the company expects to be funded from cash and cash flow generated from operations 
the company also expects to receive the remaining restricted proceeds of through the ohio air quality development authority and the ohio department of development which will be used to finance construction of emission control equipment for the middletown works blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces 
the total cost of this project is estimated to be approximately the commonwealth of kentucky also has provided the company the ability to receive tax incentives over a year period to help defray the costs for the installation of a vacuum degasser and caster modifications at its ashland works facility under the kentucky industrial revitalization act tax credit program 
through december   the company has accumulated in withholdings  of which is included as a reduction of property  plant and equipment in the consolidated financial statements 
to meet the growing demand for energy efficient products used in power generation and distribution transformers  the company is expanding its production capacity for high quality  grain oriented electrical steels 
the increased capacity will be achieved through a combination of small  targeted capital investments at existing production lines and by introducing innovative operating practices 
at december   commitments for future capital investments totaled approximately employee benefit obligations under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognizes into income loss  as a fourth quarter adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets the corridor 
prevailing interest rates on the fourth quarter measurement date are one of the factors used to determine the company s year end liability  fourth quarter corridor charge and subsequent year s expense for these benefit plans 
based on the prevailing interest rates and on other relevant assumptions made by the company  the pre tax effect of a fourth quarter non cash charge related to other postretirement benefit plans was there was no corridor charge related to pensions 
also in  the company had a net credit to equity of as a part of the adjustments necessary to recognize the minimum pension liability as required under current accounting rules 

table of contents based on the assumptions used to value other postretirement benefits  primarily retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits  cash payments for these benefits are expected to be in a range of between and in each of the next years 
based on current assumptions  the company will be required to make approximately in pension contributions during the amount and timing of future required contributions to the pension trust depends on the use of assumptions concerning future events 
the most significant of these assumptions relate to future investment performance of the pension funds  actuarial data relating to plan participants and the benchmark interest rate used to discount benefits to their present value 
because of the variability of factors underlying these assumptions  including the possibility of future pension legislation  the reliability of estimated future pension contributions decreases as the length of time until the contribution must be made increases 
currently  the company s major pension plans are significantly underfunded 
as a result  absent major increases in long term interest rates  above average returns on pension plan assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements  the company will be required to make contributions to its pension trusts of varying amounts in the long term 
some of these contributions could be substantial 
currently  the company estimates required payments for and to be in the ranges of and  respectively 
the company provides healthcare benefits to most of its employees and retirees 
the total projected future benefit obligation of the company with respect to payments for healthcare benefits is included in pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the net amount recognized by the company as of the end of for future payment of such benefit obligations was approximately billion 
accounting for retiree healthcare benefits requires the use of actuarial methods and assumptions  including assumptions about current employees future retirement dates  the anticipated mortality rate of retirees  anticipated future increases in healthcare costs and the obligation of the company under future collective bargaining agreements with respect to healthcare benefits for retirees 
changing any of these assumptions could have a material impact on the calculation of the company s total obligation for future healthcare benefits 
for example  the company s calculation of its future retiree healthcare benefit obligation as of the end of assumed that the company would continue to provide healthcare benefits to current and future retirees 
if this assumption is altered  it could have a material effect on the calculation of the company s total future retiree healthcare benefit obligation 
this assumption could be altered as a result of one or more developments 
first  retirees could consent to a change in the current level of healthcare benefits provided to them 
second  in certain instances  the union which represented a particular group of retirees when they were employed by the company could  in the course of negotiations with the company  accept such a change 
third  in certain instances  at or following the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement which affects the company s obligation to provide healthcare benefits to retired employees  the company could take action to modify or terminate the benefits provided to those retirees without the agreement of those retirees or the union  subject to the right of the union subsequently to bargain to alter or reverse such action by the company 
the precise circumstances under which retiree healthcare benefits may be altered unilaterally or by agreement with a particular union vary depending on the terms of the relevant collective bargaining agreement 
the company is unable to estimate at this time the likely impact that potential changes to the nature and or scope of its obligation to provide healthcare benefits may have on the calculation of its total future healthcare benefit obligations 
any attempt to make such a calculation would involve significant assumptions and would be subject to substantial uncertainties 
that would include changes in the assumptions which underlie the calculations  such as assumptions about current employees future retirement dates  the anticipated mortality rate of retirees  and future increases in health care costs  uncertainties as to the extent to which retirees will consent to changes to their healthcare benefits  or that the unions will agree to  or not take action to oppose  such changes in the course of negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements  and uncertainties as to the outcome of arbitrations or litigation that might be initiated by retirees or their unions over this issue 

table of contents on september  members of united steelworkers of america usw local ratified a new five year labor agreement covering about hourly production and maintenance employees at the company s ashland works in kentucky 
annual results for were negatively affected by approximately in charges associated with the implementation of this new collective bargaining agreement 
these charges related primarily to the establishment of a voluntary employees beneficiary association veba 
under the agreement  the company s contribution for retiree health care is capped at the amount 
also  under that agreement  the existing defined benefit pension plan was locked and frozen as of january   with subsequent company pension contributions to the steelworkers pension trust 
as a result  the company is required to recognize the past service pension expense that previously would have been amortized 
the fourth quarter pre tax charge related to this past service pension expense was also included in the agreement is a provision for increased active and retiree healthcare cost sharing 
labor agreements at december   the company s operations included approximately  employees  of which approximately  are represented by international or independent labor unions under various contracts that expire in the years through the contract for approximately mansfield hourly employees represented by the united steel workers of america was scheduled to expire on march  on february   the members of the union representing these employees voted to extend the contract through february  the labor contract representing approximately hourly employees at the company s ashland facility expired on september  and in september the united steelworkers of america local ratified a new five year labor agreement 
the new agreement expires september  in january  the united steelworkers of america local  the union which represents approximately hourly workers at the walbridge  oh facility of the company s wholly owned tubemaking unit  ak tube llc  ratified a new labor agreement 
the new contract expires on january  in addition  the following labor agreements to which the company is a party at the company s middletown works  zanesville works  and butler works either already are being re negotiated or will be re negotiated in the zanesville works and butler works agreements expire on may  and on september   respectively 
the middletown works labor agreement expired on february  and the parties were unable prior to its expiration to reach a new agreement 
effective march   the company elected to exercise its right to prevent the represented employees at the middletown works from continuing to work without a labor agreement 
the company has implemented its contingency plan to operate the middletown works with temporary replacement workers and salaried employees 
these three agreements cover approximately  employees 
while management is seeking to reach new agreements at these facilities without a work stoppage  the company cannot predict the outcome of the contract negotiations 
there is the potential of a work stoppage if the company and its unions cannot reach a timely agreement in contract negotiations 
the company has contingency plans to operate its facilities in the event of a work stoppage  but there is a risk that such a work stoppage nonetheless could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results 
energy and raw material hedging the company enters into derivative transactions in the ordinary course of business to hedge the cost of natural gas and certain raw materials 
at december   the consolidated balance sheets included current assets of for the fair value of these derivatives 
changes in the prices paid for the related commodities are expected to offset the effect on cash of settling these amounts 
off balance sheet arrangements the company holds an equity interest in combined metals of chicago llc  which is not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the company had provided a letter of credit to support a portion of combined metals bank indebtedness proportionate to the company s equity investment 
the fair value of this guarantee  which is not material  is recorded in accrued liabilities as of december  as of february   the company is no longer required to provide this letter of credit 

table of contents the company holds an equity interest in ak isg steel coating company ak isg  a joint venture that operates an electrogalvanizing line in cleveland  oh  and guarantees its performance under an equipment lease that terminates in in the fourth quarter of  ak isg made the decision to indefinitely idle its electrogalvanizing line effective march  as a result  the company fully impaired its investment in ak isg  resulting in a charge of in the recognition of the above guarantee is included in the impairment charge and is reserved in accrued liabilities 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into agreements under which it is obligated to make legally enforceable future payments 
these agreements include those related to borrowing money  leasing equipment and purchasing goods and services 
the following table summarizes by category expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations and commitments pension payment obligations other than pension retiree obligations other long term liabilities total in calculating the amounts for purchase obligations the company first identified all contracts under which the company has a legally enforceable obligation to purchase products or services from the vendor and or make payments to the vendor for an identifiable period of time 
then for each identified contract  the company determined its best estimate of payments to be made under the contract assuming the continued operation of existing production facilities  normal business levels  the contract would be adhered to in good faith by both parties throughout its term and prices are as set forth in the contract 
because of changes in the markets it serves  changes in business decisions regarding production levels or unforeseen events  the actual amounts paid under these contracts could differ significantly from the numbers presented above 
in december  the company reached an agreement with shenango incorporated for the supply of all of the company s anticipated coke purchases through the end of the supply agreement  extends and modifies an existing contract that was set to expire at the end of  and is included in the purchase obligation commitments above 
in october  the company entered into a year take or pay agreement with quebec cartier mining company qcm for the purchase of iron ore pellets 
this contract provides for the purchase of a significant portion of the company s iron ore needs from qcm 
the purchase price of the pellets is adjustable annually based on the market price 
a number of the purchase contracts specify a minimum volume or price for the products or services covered by the contract 
if the company were to purchase only the minimums specified  the payments set forth in the table would be reduced 
under requirements contracts the quantities of goods or services the company is required to purchase may vary depending on its needs  which are dependent on production levels and market conditions at the time 
if the company s business deteriorates or increases  the amount it is required to purchase under such a contract would likely change 
many of the agreements for the purchase of goods and services allow the company to terminate the contract without penalty upon to days prior notice 
any such termination could reduce the projected payments 

table of contents the company s consolidated balance sheets contain reserves for pension and other postretirement benefits and other long term liabilities 
the benefit plan liabilities are calculated using actuarial assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  because changes in circumstances can have a significant effect on the liabilities and expenses associated with these plans including  in the case of pensions  pending legislation  the company cannot reasonably and accurately project payments into the future 
while the company does include information about these plans in the above table  it also discusses these benefits elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to its financial statements  set forth in item the other long term liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets include reserves for environmental and legal issues  employment related benefits and insurance and other reserves 
these amounts generally do not arise from contractual negotiations with the parties receiving payment in exchange for goods and services 
the ultimate amount and timing of payments are subject to significant uncertainty and  in many cases  are contingent on the occurrence of future events  such as the filing of a claim or completion of due diligence investigations  settlement negotiations  documentation or legal proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles permit choices among alternatives and require numerous estimates of financial matters 
the company believes the accounting principles chosen are appropriate under the circumstances  and that the estimates  judgments and assumptions involved in its financial reporting are reasonable 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership passes 
this is when the products are shipped per customers instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
inventory costing inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw material  energy and other inventoriable costs more quickly than other methods 
other inventories  consisting mostly of foreign inventories and certain raw materials  are measured principally at average cost 
use of estimates accounting estimates are based on historical experience and information that is available to management about current events and actions the company may take in the future 
significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of long lived assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  environmental and legal liabilities  and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as a reserve for the loss that would be incurred if a customer is unable to pay amounts due to the company 
while losses due to customer defaults have been low  if in the future the financial condition of some customers deteriorates to an extent that may affect their ability to pay  additional allowances may be needed 
approximately of trade receivables outstanding at december  are due from businesses associated with the us automotive industry 
except in a few situations where the risk warrants it  collateral is not required on trade receivables 
while the company believes its recorded trade receivables will be collected  in the event of default in payment of a trade receivable  the company would follow normal collection procedures 

table of contents the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in estimating levels of future taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax asset  the company has considered historical results of operations and the cyclical nature of the steel business and would  if necessary  consider the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to generate future taxable income 
if future taxable income is less than the amount that has been assumed in determining the deferred tax asset  then an increase in the valuation allowance will be required  with a corresponding charge against income 
on the other hand  if future taxable income exceeds the level that has been assumed in calculating the deferred tax asset  the valuation allowance could be reduced  with a corresponding credit to income 
the company is involved in a number of environmental and other legal proceedings  including some related to asbestos exposure 
the company records a liability when it has determined that litigation has commenced or a claim or assessment has been asserted and  based on available information  it is probable that the outcome of such litigation  claim or assessment  whether by decision or settlement  will be unfavorable 
the company measures the liability using available information  including the extent of damage  similar historical situations  its allocable share of the liability and  in the case of environmental liabilities  the need to provide site investigation  remediation and future monitoring and maintenance 
accruals of probable costs have been made based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies on a case by case basis and  where appropriate  are supplemented with incurred but not reported development reserves 
however  amounts recognized in the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states exclude costs that are not probable or that may not be currently estimable 
the ultimate costs of these environmental and legal proceedings may  therefore  be higher than those currently recorded on the company s financial statements 
in addition  results of operations in any future period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or by the effectiveness of the company s strategies 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognizes into income  as a fourth quarter adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets  defined as the corridor 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
this method results in faster recognition of actuarial net gains and losses than the minimum amortization method permitted by prevailing accounting standards and used by the vast majority of companies in the united states 
faster recognition limits the amounts by which balance sheet assets and liabilities differ from economic net assets or obligations related to the plans 
however  faster recognition under this method also results in the potential for highly volatile and difficult to forecast corridor adjustments  similar to those recognized in recent years 
under the applicable accounting standards  actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
the major factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses for pension plans are the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to value pension liabilities as of the measurement date 
for other postretirement benefit plans  differences in estimated versus actual healthcare costs  changes in assumed healthcare cost trend rates or a change in the difference between the discount rate and the healthcare trend rate are major factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses 
in addition to the potential for corridor adjustments  these factors affect future net periodic benefit expenses 
changes in key assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of annual expense recognized 
for example  a one percentage point decrease in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase the projected pension expense by approximately before tax 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would increase projected other postretirement benefit expense by approximately before tax 
the discount rate used to value liabilities and assets affects both pensions and other postretirement benefit calculations 
a one quarter percentage point decrease in this rate would increase pension expense by and other postretirement expense by these estimates exclude any potential fourth quarter corridor adjustments 

table of contents property  plant and equipment the total weighted average useful life of the company s machinery and equipment is years based on the depreciable life of the assets 
the company recognizes costs associated with major maintenance activities at its operating facilities in the period in which they occur 
investments the company s financial statements consolidate the operations and accounts of the company and all subsidiaries in which the company has a controlling interest 
the company also has investments in associated companies that are accounted for under the equity method and  because the operations of these companies are integrated with the company s basic steelmaking operations  its proportionate share of their income loss is reflected in the company s cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company holds investments in debt securities and minor holdings in equity securities  which are accounted for as available for sale or held to maturity cost investments 
at december   the company had no investments that it accounted for as trading securities 
each of the company s investments is subject to a review for impairment  if and when  circumstances indicate that a loss in value below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
under these circumstances  the company would write the investment down to its fair value  which would become its new carrying amount 
the company s investment in afsg holdings  inc represents the carrying value of its discontinued insurance and finance leasing businesses  which have been largely liquidated 
the activities of the remaining operating companies are being classified as runoff and the companies are accounted for  collectively  as a discontinued operation under the liquidation basis of accounting  whereby future cash inflows and outflows are considered 
the company is under no obligation to support the operations or liabilities of these companies 
financial instruments the company is a party to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
the company s objective in using such instruments is to protect its earnings and cash flows from fluctuations in the fair value of selected commodities and currencies 
for example  in the ordinary course of business  the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps  with a duration of up to three years  to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum and zinc requirements 
the company designates these swaps as cash flow hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   currently valued outstanding commodity hedges would result in the reclassification into earnings of in net of tax losses within the next twelve months 
based on such reviews as it deems reasonable and appropriate  the company believes that all counterparties to its outstanding derivative instruments are entities with substantial credit worthiness 
goodwill at december  and  the company s assets included of goodwill 
each year  as required by sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an evaluation of goodwill to test this balance for possible impairment 
the evaluation requires that the reporting unit underlying the goodwill be measured at fair value and  if this value is less than the carrying value of the unit  a second test must be performed 
under the second test  the current fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the unit including an amount for implied goodwill 
if implied goodwill is less than the net carrying amount of goodwill  then the difference becomes the amount of the impairment that must be recorded in that year 
the company s businesses operate in highly cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate  which may lead to further impairment charges in future operating costs 
the annual review did not result in any additional goodwill impairment for the company 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revised fasb sfas r entitled  share based payment

a reduction in prevailing interest rates or improvement in the company s credit rating could increase the fair value of this debt 
a reduction in the rate used to discount total future principal and interest payments of would result in an increase in the total fair value of the company s long term debt of approximately an unfavorable effect on the company s results and cash flows from exposure to interest rate declines and a corresponding increase in the fair value of its debt would result only if the company elected to repurchase its outstanding debt securities at prevailing market prices 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in the price of certain raw materials 
in recent years  natural gas prices  in particular  have increased significantly and have been highly volatile 
at normal consumption levels  a one dollar per mcf change in natural gas prices would result in an approximate change in annual pre tax operating results  excluding the offsetting effects of any then existing hedging instruments 
in addition  due primarily to increased demand from foreign steel producers  the costs of unfinished carbon steel slabs and scrap both of which are purchased in the spot market and are not susceptible to hedging rose significantly in similarly  the company experienced a significant increase in the cost of iron ore in collectively  these and other raw material and energy cost increases have adversely affected the company s margins 
to offset such cost increases  where competitively possible  the company attempts to add a surcharge to the price of steel it sells to the spot market and to negotiate a variable pricing mechanism with its contract customers that allows the company to adjust selling prices in response to changes in the cost of raw materials and energy 
in addition  in the case of stainless steel  increased costs for nickel  chrome and molybdenum can usually be recovered through established price surcharges 
approximately of the company s sales in were made under contracts having a duration of six months or more 
the company anticipates that its percentage of contract sales will be similar in approximately half of the company s existing sales contracts by volume permit an adjustment of selling prices in response to changes in the cost of raw materials and energy 
therefore  a rise in the price of energy particularly natural gas  raw materials such as scrap  purchased slabs  coal  iron ore  and zinc or other commodities will be  in part  passed on to the company s customers rather than absorbed solely by the company 
in addition  in order to further minimize its exposure to fluctuations in raw material costs  and to secure an adequate supply of raw materials  the company has entered into multi year purchase agreements for certain raw materials that provide for fixed prices or only a limited variable price mechanism 
while enabling the company to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in raw material costs  this also exposes the company to an element of market risk relative to its sales contracts 
currently  most of the company s sales contracts have a durations of six months to one year and expire during approximately half of those contracts have fixed price terms and the other half which have some form of variable pricing do not necessarily enable the company to recoup the full amount of increases in its raw material and energy costs 
when new contracts are negotiated with the company s customers  the average sales prices could change  either up or down 
if that average sales price decreases  the company may not be able to reduce its raw material costs to a corresponding degree due to the multi year term and fixed price nature of some of its raw material purchase contracts 

table of contents the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps and or options to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum and zinc requirements 
the company s hedging strategy is designed to protect it against normal volatility 
however  abnormal price increases in any of these commodity markets could negatively impact operating costs 
gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss includes in unrealized net of tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments 
the following table presents the negative effect on pretax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december  due to an assumed and decrease in the market price of each of the indicated commodities 
commodity derivative decrease decrease natural gas zinc nickel because these instruments are structured and used as hedges  these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the physical commodity used in the normal production cycle 
the company currently does not enter into swap or option contracts for trading purposes 
the company is also subject to risks of exchange rate fluctuations on a small portion of intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company occasionally uses forward currency contracts to manage exposures to certain of these currency price fluctuations 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total value of for the sale of euros 
based on the contracts outstanding at the end of  a increase in the dollar to euro exchange rate would result in a pretax loss in the value of those contracts  which would offset the income benefit of a more favorable exchange rate
