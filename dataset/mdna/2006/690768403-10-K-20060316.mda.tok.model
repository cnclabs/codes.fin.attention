cash proceeds of approximately billion were used to repay term loans under the company s bank credit facility  which was amended to permit the sale 
the sale agreement included a post closing purchase price adjustment based on changes in certain working capital components and certain other assets and liabilities of the business 
this adjustment was finalized in april  and graham was paid approximately million 
the adjustment did not impact results of operations 
included in the sale were plastics manufacturing plants in the us  two in mexico  three in europe and two in south america  serving consumer products companies in the food  beverage  household  chemical and personal care industries 
the blow molded plastic container operations were part of the consumer products business unit of the plastics packaging segment 
as required by fas no 
 the company has presented the results of operations for the blow molded plastic container business in the consolidated results of operations for and as a discontinued operation 
interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on debt that was required to be repaid from the proceeds

asbestos related costs the fourth quarter charge for asbestos related costs was million million after tax  compared to the fourth quarter charge of million million after tax 
these charges resulted from the company s comprehensive annual review of asbestos related liabilities and costs 
in each case  the company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed during the several years following the completion of the comprehensive review 
see critical accounting estimates for further information 
asbestos related cash payments for were million  a reduction of million  or  from during  the company disposed of approximately  claims 
certain dispositions in and prior years have included deferred amounts payable over periods ranging up to seven years 
deferred amounts payable at december  were approximately million virtually unchanged from the amount at december  the company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis 
as of december   the number of asbestos related claims pending against the company was approximately  down from approximately  pending claims at december  a former business unit of the company produced specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from until  when the business was sold 
in line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over years ago  the company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the company s products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
non operational items impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment testing using business enterprise values and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill of its asia pacific glass business unit

the company had recorded net deferred tax assets related principally to asbestos charges and net operating losses in recent years 
the amount of valuation allowance required under the provisions of fas no 
is dependent upon projected near term us profitability including the effects of tax planning 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that an additional valuation allowance was necessary because of the near term effects on us profitability of continued asbestos related payments  significant interest expense  rising energy costs and other cost increases 
non operational items plastics packaging assets in august of  the company initiated a review of its plastics packaging assets in the asia pacific region 
the review was completed during the fourth quarter of the company used a combination of estimated divestment cash flows  which included bid prices from potential purchasers  and partial liquidation values for certain assets to determine the net realizable values of the assets 
the company compared the estimated net realizable values to the book values of the assets and determined that asset impairment existed 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million million after tax to write down the assets to realizable values 
certain of the plastics businesses in the asia pacific region operate in highly competitive markets leading to reduced profit margins 
in addition  the company s pet container business has lost a significant amount of business in the past few years 
the reduced business and overall excess capacity in the industry has caused a reduction in the overall value of the business 
during  the company completed the sale of a portion of this business and is continuing to evaluate prospective buyers for the remaining businesses 
the company does not expect to record any further material losses related to this business 
capital resources and liquidity current and long term debt the company s total debt at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  on october   in connection with the sale of the company s blow molded plastic container operations  the company s subsidiary borrowers entered into the third amended and restated secured credit agreement the agreement 
the proceeds from the sale were used to repay c and d term loans and a portion of the b term loan outstanding under the previous credit agreement 
on january   the company completed the required divestiture of two european glass container factories and received proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were largely used to repay debt during the first quarter 
at december   the agreement included a million revolving credit facility and a million a term loan  each of which has a final maturity date of april  it also included a million b term loan  a million c term loan  and a million c term loan  each of which has a final maturity date of april  the agreement also permits the company  at its option  to refinance certain of its outstanding notes and debentures prior to their scheduled maturity 
at december   the company s subsidiary borrowers had unused credit of million available under the agreement 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the agreement at december  was 
including the effects of cross currency swap agreements related to borrowings under the agreement by the company s australian subsidiary  as discussed in note  the weighted average interest rate was 
the agreement contains covenants and provisions that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments  pay dividends  create liens on assets  enter into contingent obligations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  change the business conducted  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities

during december  a subsidiary of the company issued senior notes totaling million and senior notes totaling million 
the notes bear interest at  and are due december  both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
the indentures for both series of notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued  and senior secured notes and senior notes 
the issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately million in addition to borrowings under the agreement to purchase in a tender offer million of the million senior notes due  million of the million bsn notes due and million of the million bsn notes due as part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer  the company recorded in the fourth quarter of additional interest charges of million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees 
the senior secured notes and senior notes that were issued during the past four years were part of the company s plan to improve financial flexibility by issuing long term fixed rate debt  as well as refinance existing fixed rate debt that was nearing maturity 
while this strategy extended the maturity of the company s debt  long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing compared to shorter term  variable rate debt 
the company does not intend to continue to refinance variable rate debt with new fixed rate issuances  but will continue to issue long term fixed rate debt in order to repay existing fixed rate debt that is nearing maturity 
during the fourth quarter of  the company expanded the capacity of its european accounts receivable securitization program from million to million to include operations in italy and the united kingdom 
the accounts receivable securitization program provides lower costs of financing than traditional bank debt 
the terms of this expansion resulted in a changing from off balance sheet to on balance sheet accounting for the program 
the net impact was an increase  at december   in reported accounts receivable and consolidated debt of million 
cash flows for  cash provided by continuing operating activities was million compared with million for the working capital reduction in occurred largely in bsn operations following its acquisition in june when inventories were at seasonally high levels 
higher payments of accrued liabilities and accounts payable  including approximately million for european restructuring activities  also required more cash in than in in addition  cash flows in benefited from the initial effects of the company s program to improve working capital management 
for the year ended december   the company paid million in cash interest compared with million for the amount included million for repurchase premiums 
exclusive of that amount  cash paid for interest decreased million from the decrease in cash interest paid is primarily due to lower overall interest rates from the june repricing of the agreement  lower rates on fixed rate debt  lower average debt balances and the effects of cross currency swaps in australia 
asbestos related payments for decreased million  or  to million  compared with million for the company expects that its total asbestos related payments in will be moderately lower than based on the company s expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the company s expected operating cash flow  the company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims  and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos  will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity on a short term or long term basis 
capital spending for property  plant and equipment from continuing operating activities was million compared to million in the prior year 
the amount included spending in the acquired bsn operations for the full year compared to the amount which included only the period from june through december  the company continues to focus on reducing capital spending and improving its return on invested capital by improving capital efficiency 
cash flows from financing activities included payments by foreign operations to settle swaps of borrowings denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency 
in particular  during the second quarter of certain swaps that hedged us dollar borrowings in australia required payments at maturity of approximately million 
these payments offset the australian dollar gains recorded over the year duration of the swaps during which the australian dollar strengthened significantly against the us dollar 
the company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs  debt service and other obligations on a short term and long term basis 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following information summarizes the company s significant contractual cash obligations at december  dollars in millions 
payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than one year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases contractual purchase obligation interest pension benefit plan contributions postretirement benefit plan benefit payments total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total less than one year years years more than years standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments critical accounting estimates the company s analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap

the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where estimates and assumptions affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
the company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans  contingencies and litigation  goodwill  and deferred tax assets involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pension benefit plans the determination of pension obligations and the related pension expense or credits to operations involves significant estimates 
the most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension charges or credits for the year 
the company uses discount rates based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year 
at december   the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 
the company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets 
due to the nature of the plans assets and the volatility of debt and equity markets  results may vary significantly from year to year 
for example  actual returns in the company s two largest plans were negative in each of the years the returns exceeded in  in and in the company refers to average historical returns over longer periods up to years in determining its expected rates of return because short term fluctuations in market values do not reflect the rates of return the company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy 
for  the company s estimated weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension assets was compared to for the year ended december  the company recorded pension expense from continuing operations totaling approximately million and million for and  respectively  from its principal defined benefit pension plans 
the reduction in net pension expense resulted from changes in the us salary plan  partially offset by lower discount rates  lower return rates and higher amortization 
depending on currency translation rates  the company expects to record approximately million of pension expense for the full year of  compared with expense of million for future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance 
for example  a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately million in pretax pension expense for the full year in addition  changes in external factors  including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities  could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities 
if the accumulated benefit obligation abo of any of the company s principal pension plans in the us and australia exceeds the fair value of its assets at the next measurement date of december   the company will be required to write off the related prepaid pension asset and record a liability equal to the excess of the abo over the fair value of the asset of such plan at the next measurement date of december  the non cash charge would result in a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth 
amounts related to the company s us and australian plans as of december  were as follows millions of dollars us salary plans us hourly plans australian plans total fair value of assets accumulated benefit obligations excess prepaid pension asset the company is unable to predict discount rates or asset values at the next measurement date of december  however  if asset values and discount rates decline from their december  levels  the abo of the us salary plan may exceed the plan s assets at the measurement date 
in that event  the plan s prepaid asset would be written off resulting in a pre tax charge to other comprehensive income in the range of million to million 
even if the fair values of the us plans assets are less than abo at december   the company believes it will not be required to make cash contributions to the us plans for at least several years 
the covenants under the company s third amended and restated secured credit agreement would not be affected by a reduction in the company s net worth if a significant non cash charge was taken to write off the prepaid pension assets 
contingencies and litigation the company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability ie  its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the company s ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the united states  the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation  the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits  the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure  and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy 
the company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims  which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years 
the company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the company 
the company conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing and reporting its annual results of operations  unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review 
if the results of an annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated future asbestos related costs  then the company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability 
the company believes that an estimation of the reasonably probable amount of the contingent liability for claims not yet asserted against the company is not possible beyond a period of several years 
therefore  while the results of future annual comprehensive reviews cannot be determined  the company expects the addition of one year to the estimation period will result in an annual charge 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million million after tax to increase its accrued liability for asbestos related costs 
this amount was reduced from the charge of million 
the factors and developments that particularly affected the determination of this increase in the accrual included the following i the decline in yearly cash outlays  ii the slight decline in serious disease filings against the company and the significant decline in the non malignancy filings  iii the company s successful litigation record during the year  and iv legislative developments in several states 
the company s estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill as required by fas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  the company evaluates goodwill annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
the company conducts its evaluation as of october of each year 
goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value bev of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax projected future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
this bev is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment of goodwill may exist 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual testing and determined that impairment existed in the goodwill of its asia pacific glass business unit 
following a review of the unit s identifiable assets  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill 
if the company s projected future cash flows were substantially lower  or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher  the testing performed as of october   may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the company s other reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would also have been impaired 
however  based on the company s testing as of that date  modest changes in the projected future cash flows or cost of capital would not have created impairment in any other reporting unit 
the company will monitor conditions throughout that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to october may be appropriate 
if the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary  then the company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of  or earlier if appropriate 
in the event the company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill  the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth 
deferred tax assets fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses 
in the united states  the company has recorded significant deferred tax assets  the largest of which relate to net operating losses  capital losses  tax credits and the accrued liability for asbestos related costs that are not deductible until paid 
the deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities  the most significant of which relate to the prepaid pension asset and accelerated depreciation 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of us deferred tax assets not offset by deferred tax liabilities 
should the company be required to write off the prepaid pension assets related to the us pension plans as described above under pension benefit plans  the related deferred tax liability would also be written off  leaving deferred tax assets amounting to approximately million without a valuation allowance 
it is currently likely that an additional valuation allowance would be required in that case since it is currently more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  and changes in commodity prices  principally energy 
the company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices 
in addition  the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed and floating rate debt and to reduce interest expense 
these instruments carry varying degrees of counterparty credit risk 
to mitigate this risk  the company has established limits on the exposure with individual counterparties and the company regularly monitors these exposures 
substantially all of these exposures are with counterparties that are rated single a or above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk earnings of operations outside the united states a substantial portion of the company s operations are conducted by subsidiaries outside the us the primary international markets served by the company s subsidiaries are in canada  australia  south america principally colombia  brazil and venezuela  and europe principally italy  france  the netherlands  germany  the united kingdom  and poland 
in general  revenues earned and costs incurred by the company s major international operations are denominated in their respective local currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the international markets in which the company s subsidiaries operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases 
the company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the us dollar  however  if economic conditions in venezuela continue to decline  the company may be required to adopt the us dollar as the functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country 
the company does not hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to earnings of operations outside the united states 
borrowings not denominated in the functional currency because the company s subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with borrowings denominated in the local currency to the extent practicable where debt financing is desirable or necessary 
considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
in those countries where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  however  local currency borrowings expose the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
available excess funds of a subsidiary may be redeployed through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment  capital investment  or other cash requirements 
generally  each intercompany loan is denominated in the lender s local currency giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower 
to mitigate this risk  the borrower generally enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency 
similarly  certain of the company s international subsidiaries have external borrowings denominated in currencies other than the designated functional currency  giving rise to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the borrower 
to mitigate this risk  certain subsidiaries have entered into currency swaps or forward exchange contracts for the principal amount of their borrowings and  in some cases  the related interest 
significant transactions related to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from borrowings not denominated in the functional currency are as follows at the end of  the company s subsidiary in australia had an agreement that swaps a total of us million of borrowings into million australian dollars 
this derivative instrument swaps the principal from us dollars to australian dollars and also swaps the interest rate from a us based rate to an australian based rate 
this agreement has a maturity date of march in connection with debt refinancing in late december  the company s subsidiary in france borrowed approximately million from owens brockway glass container obgc  a us subsidiary of the company  at a fixed interest rate through in order to hedge the changes in the cash flows of the foreign currency interest and principal repayments  obgc entered into a swap that converts the euro coupon interest payments into a predetermined us dollar coupon interest payment and also converts the final principal payment in december from million to approximately million us dollars 
the company s subsidiaries in australia  canada and several european countries have also entered into short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings by each subsidiary into its local currency 
these contracts swap the principal amount of borrowings and in some cases they swap the related interest 
purchases and sales not denominated in the functional currency through the use of forward exchange contracts  the company fixes some or all of the future amount payable receivable on significant purchases and sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary entering into the underlying transaction 
these instruments typically have terms of one year or less 
significant transactions related to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from purchases and sales not denominated in the functional currency are as follows the company entered into a foreign currency exchange contract to swap million into million us dollars related to anticipated western european fuel oil purchases  a portion of which is denominated in us dollars 
the swap mitigates foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to approximately of the anticipated fuel oil purchases in western europe 
the company believes the near term exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk of its foreign currency risk sensitive instruments was not material at december  and interest rate risk the company s interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates applicable to its us dollar indebtedness 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion that mature from through the swaps were executed in order to i convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt  ii maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt  and iii reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term 
under the swaps  the company receives fixed rate interest amounts equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note and pays interest at a six month us libor rate set in arrears plus a margin spread see table below 
the interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense during each six month period over the term of the agreement 
the following table provides information about the company s interest rate sensitivity related to its significant debt obligations and interest rate swaps at december  for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contract maturity date

the company believes it can mitigate a portion of this risk by passing commodity cost changes through to customers 
in addition  the company enters into commodity futures contracts related to forecasted natural gas and fuel oil requirements  the objectives of which are to limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid for natural gas and fuel oil and the related volatility in cash flows 
the company continually evaluates the natural gas and fuel oil market with respect to its forecasted usage requirements over the next twelve to eighteen months and periodically enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements over that period 
significant transactions related to commodity price risk are as follows at december   the company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately approximately  mm btus of its expected north american natural gas usage for full year of and approximately approximately  mm btus for the full year of at december   the company had also entered into commodity futures contracts for substantially all of its expected western european fuel oil usage approximately  metric tons for the first quarter of the company believes the near term exposure to commodity price risk of its commodity futures contracts was not material at december  and forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and section a of the securities act of forward looking statements reflect the company s current expectations and projections about future events at the time  and thus involve uncertainty and risk 
it is possible the company s future financial performance may differ from expectations due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to the following foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  changes in capital availability or cost  including interest rate fluctuations  the general political  economic and competitive conditions in markets and countries where the company has its operations  including disruptions in the supply chain  competitive pricing pressures  inflation or deflation  and changes in tax rates and laws  consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging  fluctuations in raw material and labor costs  availability of raw materials  costs and availability of energy  transportation costs  consolidation among competitors and customers  the ability of the company to integrate operations of acquired businesses and achieve expected synergies  unanticipated expenditures with respect to environmental  safety and health laws  the performance by customers of their obligations under purchase agreements  and the timing and occurrence of events which are beyond the control of the company  including events related to asbestos related claims 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors
